Recovery,"Here are some advices for all of you  Hello, I am trying to recover as of now I am still underweight however there are some things I'd like to advice people who want to start recovering in case they can't get a professional help.
( sorry for the bad english in advance)

These are my tips for people to limit their anxieties that ai have discovered in my journey of recovering ( I am still recovering)-



Set yourself a limit- don't be afraid of the scale, measure your weight and set your current weight as the starting point, meaning= you can not lose anymore weight. No matter what do not lose weight under your starting point, make any number under your current weight as your worst enemy.

One binge is not a reason to start straving yourself- Remeber this rule, one day of dieting does not make you lose weight, and one day of binging does not make you fat all of a sudden, so do not starve yourself the next day.

Start doing some sport- being physically active is good for your mental health and for the body and makes you a justification to eat more cause you have burned some calories due to the sport activity that you have done."
Recovery,"Weird question  I relapsed again and this is the deepest I’ve ever been into my Ed. I will maybe eat a bit of food once a day, or make a whole meal and take it into my room so no one gets suspicious but I just chew and spit it. I’ve lost a lot of weight in the last week alone and I’m scared if I pass out or something will I get hospitalized? I’m still not even close to being underweight but my parents are dramatic and might make me go to the er. Do you think the doctors would know?"
Recovery,My restriction gets significantly worse surrounding my menstrual cycle. Anyone else experience this?

Disordered,"Just want to go to the pub and have a few beers watching the match  All I can think about is calories in the beer and no protein. My life is dominated by getting enough protein to not lose muscle at least and restricting everything I enjoy that has calories, especially drinking them.

&#x200B;

Why can't I escape these though and just live a life everyone else does :("
Disordered,"what is this?  so, idk why i randomly decided to make a post on this subreddit. im not diagnosed with any type of eating disorder, but this kind of thing has been on my mind for a while. 

im an overweight person that has binge ate since i was a young kid. i started gaining weight when i was in 3rd grade and just kept being overweight. i was only ever shamed for my body, not properly given help so it caused me a lot of very bad issues with food. ive went through repeated cycles of starving, binging and purging, to just binging. that continued for a couple of years when i was younger. 

throughout this year, ive went through weeks where i only drank water and took vitamins. i had medical problems shortly after the most recent time where i had to have surgery. im not sure if thats directly related because i lied to the doctors, and they aren't completely sure why everything happened. during that time i couldn't eat anything for days, which is what made me get admitted to a hospital. i was put on a regular diet, but i couldn't eat so i just sat with an IV in for the days i was in the hospital. i lost a bunch of weight, but after surgery everything was fine and i went home like everything was normal. 

afterwards, i went through periods of eating normally to eating less than a meal a day. but i usually always end up going back to eating normally.

this time, it's very different. my eating patterns aren't the center of my universe, like it usually is when i starve. i found a way to tolerate eating as little as possible every day and tricked myself into not hyperfixating on it, so i don't end up binging. it's been a while and i haven't been able to stop since. 

now that there's an explanation to the questions i want to ask. what is this? is this an eating disorder? or just disordered eating?

every time i think about it, all my thoughts just go to the fact that im overweight. i don't want to see it as a problem, because of that. i need an outsiders perspective."
Disordered,"My triggers are the opposite?  I find that I get triggered into eating rather than restricting and it’s really weird and overwhelming, I find that when I stay at my boyfriends place I find eating so much easier and struggle less with disordered thoughts, and he reassures me he doesn’t care about my size as long as I’m healthy, and then for a few days after I have the recovery “binge” thing where I kind of without thinking will just eat whatever and how much I feel like before the disordered thoughts and compensation comes back even stronger. I don’t know if this is just a me thing or if this is weird? Does anyone else experience this???"
Disordered,"when does it get better ?  I’ve never posted before so I’m sorry if this is weird 

i was inpatient last year for 4 months (in Canada) and I thought when I came out I could continue to gain weight and get to a healthy bmi as well as fix my relationship with food, but it’s just not happening. I’m so sad it feels like my brain just wants me to basically starve. I look at old pictures of myself as a kid and it just breaks my heart, I’m so mean to her (well me I guess). I’ve ruined my stomach to the point that I see a GI specialist weekly and I’m now chronically Ill. like what the fuck is going on :( I just want to be happy and healthy and be a normal 19 year old. I think I’ve permanently destroyed myself and I’m heartbroken. I miss all of the happy foods I used to eat, and friendships I’ve lost because I couldn’t go to school or work for a year. This is devastating.

So I guess I’m asking, how were any of you able to recover ? When does it start to get better ? when does your brain begin to not be so disordered ?"
Recovery,"FREE online virtual Ed recovery groups  To everyone who is not getting the recovery support they need from this sub (or any other Ed subs) there are tons of FREE eating disorder recovery meetings online. I’m going to link a Google doc full of times, links, and meetings. In order to attend, you click the link of the meeting and register however their website prompts you. 

I hope this helps anyone who is struggling and feeling triggered or violated when you are in these ED sub reddits. At the end of the day, if you’re seeking true and pure recovery energy, Reddit isn’t it. ED support groups through legitimate organizations are it.

Disordered,im so sick and tired of some ppl on this sub  they post numbers and compare calorie intakes. fuck. now i wanna restrict even more. this sub was supposed to be my safe space. i block stuff on other social media that mentions weight and kcal but this sub was supposed to be fucking safe. i hate this and its like the mods dont even care.
Disordered,"Want to Relapse Desperately  I’ve wanted to relapse for a while, I’ve been recovered for about a year and gained back more weight than my ED took from me. I’ve tried finding a therapist to try and keep me from falling back but I ended up with a bunch of rejected consultation requests. I don’t know what else to do, everyone liked me more when I was sick anyway. I miss it so much, and no one in my life really understands when I try and have a conversation about it. I just feel so alone and I feel like I utterly failed."
Disordered,"Inpatient treatment in Sydney Australia  By any chance has anyone here been to inpatient treatment in Sydney (or somewhere within a few hours of) and can share their experience? I'm seriously considering it because attempting to recover by myself thus far has been a total flop and I'm very unwell and terrified.

I don't have private health insurance, but as I'm considering all avenues, if someone has been inpatient at a private hospital I'm wondering what the quote and bill would've been for you if you weren't covered.

If it's relevant I've already got a diagnosis so that's not an issue.

Thanks in advance."
Disordered,"my brother is starting to catch onto my habits and it’s worrying me.  he’s hardly eating and keeps working out like too much. my parents have noticed his weight loss, everyone has but i’m the most concerned. the way he’s doing it is not healthy. and he’s seen me battle with my ed and i’m really worried on how to help him. 

he would see me refusing to eat but i wouldn’t ever make it THAT obvious. 

i tried to talk to him but he would just scream “i’m not starving myself” when clearly he is. 

he’s just a 13 year old boy i don’t want him to go down this path .."
Recovery,"Recovery belly  I've been struggling recently im back at a healthy wait but I don't look like any of the other girls all the weight is im my stomach I have no hips or waist and barely any boobs it just sticks out like im pregnant I can't wear crop tops and feel comfortable it makes me so insecure I haven't gone through puberty yet im 14 and got me ed around 12 will I go through puberty and lose my stomach, does it go away?????"
Disordered,"I just realized how sick I am and it saddens me.  I've been sick with food poisoning for the past week and couldn't keep anything down. I joked to myself that I would finally be able to lose weight.

Well I did. 

Also, I don't know how I didn't gain the weight back, because I've been eating like crap the past few days. Anyways, I decided to try on a pair of jeans that ALWAYS fits tight around my waist. I wanted to see if I could no longer fit into them. To my surprise, I fit perfectly into them and it was even a little loose on me. I jumped up and down excited that I finally lost weight.

Now, I realize that this disorder is really a mental illness. I should not have that much excitement for losing weight because I was physically sick and wishing to myself that I could be sick again. This is sad.

I need help."
Recovery,I started eating one meal a day again.. now the binge eating habits are kicking in and things are harder and harder to hold back.. how do I stop this? :(  
Recovery,"Still Waking Up Hungry  I’m six months into recovery, but I still wake up hungry nearly every night. It’s always for something sweet/a little Carby, and it’s like I have to eat otherwise I can’t fall back asleep.

Is there a way to make this stop? I lived with my partner for two months and it didn’t happen, but it’s happening again now and is very disruptive."
Disordered,i hate the way i carry my weight  I’m officially the same weight that I was in middle school. im even an inch taller than I was back then which was literally ten years ago. back then I was a stick figure and would get made fun of for being skinny. now I’m the same weight but look NOTHING like I used to which is so upsetting to me. I hate that I have a grown woman body now. I hate my stupid curves I hate having boobs and an ass. tonight at dinner my mom told my brother (who I only see every once in a while) “look at how tiny she is now” and he says “she doesn’t look to scrawny to me” which was strangely very triggering and upsetting to me. It’s the same kind of stuff that my bf will say to me. i don’t understand how I’m underweight but don’t look it at all.
Disordered,"I literally can’t find an ED informed / trained primary care doctor  I’ve been emailing, calling, and reaching out to so many different people. Either there is no one who has Ed experience, they aren’t taking clients, or they aren’t in practice anymore, or they have zero Ed experience. Like what the fuck? So what am I supposed to do? I can’t see a normal pcp because I’ve been traumatized by doctors telling me “I’m fine” “I’m not that sick” “eat less fat and salt” etc. like no. I’m underweight, I’m not going to let a dr tell me that I’m fine and to eat less and move more, ( my OBGYN office literally told me to do that) . I’m losing my mind. I’ve been restricting so heavily I am feeling like shit and my health anxiety is so high. What the fuck am I supposed to do? I need to find a Dr to actually check everything so I can be more at ease"
Disordered,"Should I weigh myself?? Too late. Fuck.  I haven't weighed myself since mid January. I've been restricting a ton since then, and I know I've lost a lot of weight, but I've been so effing curious as to how much I've *actually* lost. I think about it all day. I thought I had a really good idea of what the number would be based off of the clothes I was wearing, but I still wanted an exact number. Today when I went to my mom's house, I did it, I weighed myself, and I instantly started crying. I am at least xx lbs more than I thought I was. Now I'm spiraling. Bad. Why the fuck did I step on that scale??"
Recovery,"recovery success!! i hope Ella is proud of me  a little over a year ago i made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/omt2rb/im_so_fucking_upset_right_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)


TDLR- i knew a little girl called Ella in the psych ward who was like a little sister to me. i wasn’t aware that she basicaly relied on me for sanity and passed away by suicide very shortly after i left her behind at the ward 


she left a note behind (attached to the original post) which made it very clear that she wanted me to recover, so i did. i hated it at first. it was awful. i can’t lie i’ve had slip ups. but i kept pushing for her


since then, ive been under the impression that i wasn’t truly recovering because i was only really doing it to make a former little best friend happy


and although this was true for a while, this morning i realised that it wasn’t like that anymore. i truly enjoy eating food and have been counting calories less and less, i don’t even do it in my head anymore. i don’t religiously step on the scale every morning anymore. i look forward to eating and ive been properly enjoying sports like i’ve never done before. i initially started doing sports like basketball to burn calories when i had really bad anorexia but now i’ve genuinely enjoyed it and other sports as a hobbies, and so many more things 


realising that i’m finally doing this for myself is so refreshing and i feel really happy looking at myself in the mirror 


i don’t know if there’s an afterlife or not but if there is one i really hope she sees how hard i’ve worked, and how grateful i am to her for giving me the push i so desperately needed. i might have developed crippling mommy issues, a fear of psych wards, and a lot of guilt from leaving her behind there, i hope she knows that she didn’t die in vain and she’s still so special to everyone who had the pleasure of knowing her"
Recovery,"2 questions sorry  I don't have anorexia but I feel like I'm on the verge of developing something like it. These 2 concerns I have might encourage me to start eating more. Sorry if this sounds weird or superficial.

1) Does anorexia affect the development of the face during puberty? E.g the jawline. I know anorexia stunts height during puberty but anything else?

2) Does it affect the development of the vocal cords? I read that it can in teenagers. I want to be able to sing well."
Disordered,i hate binging  i ate half a pizza last night and i cannot stop going to the bathroom. i regret eating already in the first place and now i have to deal with the stomach pain and diarrhea for the rest of today. i hate this.
Disordered,"Is anorexia only body-image related?  Hi, I'm new to posting on reddit (and using reddit in general) so in advance I'd like to apologise for any mistakes or fumbles I have with this. I'd also like to apologise if this is what could be considered a ""dumb question"". 

I'll be honest, all I really know about anorexia is pretty much as much as the average person. It's an ED, and severely impacts a person's self-esteem, perception of self and body, and damages their relationship with their body, and with food, etc. Now, my question is, is it possible to have anorexia (or any eating disorder) without the body image aspect? The reason I'm asking is- well, I don't have a great relationship with food, but funnily enough it has next to nothing to do with my appearance. 

I've been underweight since the day I was born, tbh, and have always struggled with eating. I just.. was never very good at it. (Doesn't help that I could occasionally be a picky eater from time to time. Peas, I'm looking at you!) I didn't *hate* it, but I'd get full or bored of foods very quickly. It got worse as I got older. Another thing is, I... it's hard to explain. My mood severely affects my appetite often, and I often find myself putting off food because I don't want to go downstairs and encounter my mother (that relationship is a... whole can of worms in of itself), and it would get to the point where I'd just. Go hours not eating, and when I do eat, it's mostly when no one else but me is downstairs. Say I have a nap, awake at 7pm. I'll wait until my mother goes upstairs at, say, 11pm, and then go. I see eating as a chore, not something that's a natural part of life- I enjoy eating food, yes, but it's also a lot of effort. I put off eating a lot, to be honest, but moreso now that I'm more conscious of just how underweight and unhealthy I really am (again- about... 5% of that is related to the way I look. 95% of it is knowing I can't walk down the road without getting winded). I feel guilt knowing I'm not doing enough to improve my health, and somehow, ironically, doing the actual thing that would help (eating) only makes the guilt more prominent, like it's harder to ignore. Sometimes when I feel guilt or shame over other things, or emotional (which happens a lot, I'm easily upset by little things), I'll put off food too. Like I don't ""deserve"" it.

Sorry for rambling on about myself, but- I guess that's my question. Can you have an eating disorder that isn't linked to body image? (I'm not looking to self-diagnose or anything like that either, before anyone asks, so don't worry about that. I'm just wondering if maybe I should consider bringing it up as a possibility, but everywhere I've looked, the emphasis is on self-image and body positivity, which isn't the problem I'm having, so I'm wondering if it would even ""count"".)"
Disordered,"i feel like im worthless  this is prolly one of these posts ill write cos i feel like shit and then ill cringe when i read it later but whatever. 

i feel so fucking worthless rn.  im such a colossal failure in every way.  i am good at nothing, not a single thing.  everything about me is so mundane and so boring, there isn't anything interesting about me at all.  im not attractive or smart or funny or skinny.  i look disgusting and i feel disgusting.  i wish i was good at something, anything but i just... exist.  i hate being someone who just exists so much, so much that id rather not exist at all.  

the only remotely interesting thing about me is ana, and even then im terrible at being an anorexic.  ive had to convince every doctor or therapist or whoever that im anorexic, im always having to convince people im not a faker.  i let people walk all over me, all it took was a couple threats to make me go into recovery.  all the weight id lost, i was so close to my goal and i let myself be forced, i just sat there and let it happen cos i was too scared.  im so pathetic.  ive not been restricting for 5 or so weeks and im already sick of my body and sick of eating and i just disappoint myself more and more every single day.  apparently my diagnosis i thought i got a couple months ago was bullshit, ill find out for sure on tuesday.  i don't even want to find out tbh, i won't like the answer.  ive wanted a diagnosis for a long time and i thought id get one but it was false hope.  like everything else in my worthless waste of a life it was too good to be true, im back to convincing everyone im not a liar.  if i was just fucking skinny i wouldn't feel like this, if i was still underweight maybe id still have a sliver of confidence.

idek where im going with this post, im just fucking miserable and wanna die and you all have been really sweet to me so far, despite feeling like an imposter and like i don't really belong here.  at this point idk if ill ever not feel like a fake, but i feel like im intruding in a space where i shouldn't be.  kinda like the narrator from fight club at the beginning lol.  anyways, thanks for reading and im sorry if this is really incomprehensible im writing this through tears and brain fog lmao"

Recovery,"Did anybody else keep their period at their worst, but lose it in recovery?  I never lost my period when I was consistently restricting calories, but now that I’m in recovery, it’s been gone for months. There have been a lot of binges during this period, so wondering if that has anything to do with it.

Recovery,"The comorbidity of ana fetishists and pedos  Just wondering if any of you have noticed the same things as I have when it comes to fetishists. For instance, thinner women(or men) with smaller busts who are shorter, resemble youth more closely & I noticed that fetishists become more predatory as you lose weight & look more childlike. I personally believe almost all ana chasers are pedos in disguise, what do y’all think?"
Recovery,My girlfriend has an eating disorder (one egg or corn a day) and I really don’t know how to deal with it - Has anyone ever had any experience dealing with such a thing? Ever since she came back from her hometown after spending a month with her Anorexic mother.  
Recovery,"how do i stop thinking of the ""tummy bump"" as fat?  pretty much the title. its one of my biggest hurdles. i *know* its supposed to be there. thats what health experts say, amd what other people say. i measure it and it only sticks up from my surrounding skin a couple millimeters. i see pictures of girls i think are cute or beautiful and they all have this slightly raised area around their navel.

but it doesnt matter, i cant stop thinking of it as a fat pouch. i pick at it and pinch it and feel like i need to cut it off. everyone says its supposed to be there but i dont know how to believe them"
Disordered,"Wish life was a little simpler  This is a rant that has possible triggers. 
I’ve struggled with my weight for years. I was shamed as a child and bullied throughout middle and high school. I thought as I grew older I’d feel better, but now at 22 I feel kinda hopeless. I suffered from a massive ED my junior year of college with anorexia: subtype of purging. Was the smallest I’d been in years and loved it. But hated the way I felt. I met my boyfriend and I started to recover. However, my boyfriend is a cross and track runner and is incredibly fit and small, his friends are too. They make me feel incredibly uncomfortable when I’m around them and all I can do is focus on what I wish I looked like. I am disabled so I am unable to use my knees properly. But I pushed myself to work out and ate the way I needed to and went to a different country and looked even better due to better foods. And finally felt pretty. But when I came back I gained so much weight back and couldn’t get myself together. Now, if I eat anything, I purge (except for really low calorie foods or drinks to keep myself going). I haven’t seen a lot of weight loss, but enough. I feel as if his family, friends, and sometimes inadvertently him think I look better smaller and need to loose weight. He tries to be encouraging and is very worried for me right now. But I just feel gross. And the inability to run or do much with my knees makes it even more defeating. I graduated college with a psychology degree which makes this worse because I studied these things and work with children and adults who suffer from the very thing I do and I give them advice I cannot even take. And to add on to this rant, my little sister is exactly what I want to look like and have always wanted to look like and when I see her it hurts me a little. I really hope I don’t break any rules and am not glorifying what I am doing, because I know there are better ways. But I just feel broken and it’s almost a way of punishment for not being what I should be. I am sorry this is so long, but as I am very much unable to share this with anyone else, I wanted a little outlet here. I am sorry if it comes off incoherently written. 

TL;DR- Life struggle with body image and ED’s and wanted a little outlet for myself."
Disordered,"Can’t stop comparing myself  I’m a guy that’s been struggling with ana for the past few years, and coming from a childhood where I was obese to now being at a “healthy” weight/bmi.. nothing is ever good enough. I’ll feel so good about my restriction paying off by losing weight but it’s like the second I step outside and see the other boys around me I can’t help but feel so disgusted at myself. I’ll stare into the mirror for so long just wishing I could make all the fat disappear. My gut thighs arms none of it even compares to the other boys online and irl I see with their lanky statures and flat stomachs. I’ve lost over 70 lbs at this point but I’ll never shake the feeling that’s stuck with me ever since I was obese. I should be happy with where I’m at but my brain stops me from doing so. I’ll forever compare myself and I hate it because I should be happy of all that I’ve accomplished.

My self worth is solely based on my appearance and I know it’s terrible but being gay it’s like you either look good or just die lonely and all I crave is for belonging and validation. My best guess as to why I am this way is because when I was fat, I was never seen as anything other than the funny friend. No one ever complimented my looks whilst I was surrounded by skinny guys that would always receive compliments and validation. They only found me funny because I was fat and made a fool of myself. I’ve been a people pleaser ever since because it’s the only form of acceptance I know and I hate myself for it"

Disordered,Losing control  The last few months have been really rough and I’m spiraling right back to the place I was a few years ago. The breaking point was when my (m) boyfriend of three years cheated on me with a younger skinnier woman. I’ll never be that for him no matter what I do. I’m spiraling back into my ed and not much can stop me. I’m restricting and my roommates have started to notice. It got really bad when they left for a week and I just didn’t eat at all. My brain in clouded in this fog and my depression is some of the worst it’s ever been. I feel like I’ve lost all control and all semblance of who I was just last year. I just don’t know what to do with myself.
Disordered,"Trouble with refeed meal plan  
I (f15/uk)had a one week meal plan which was supposed to end yesterday but since I didn’t gain enough weight from it,my psychologist said that I need to continue eating like how I did on the highest calorie days of the meal plan (day 7). I managed to eat most of the stuff from the meal plan yesterday(day 7) but today my parents keep on forcing me to eat everything.i know they not trying to cause any harm but I’m literally on the verge of throwing up because of how full I am all the time and I can barely move because I feel so heavy. I def have to continue this for more than a week but I’m very certain I’m going to throw up today(not on purpose). What do I do?"
Disordered,"Panic attack???  So I've been restricting my calories for a while and that's been fine, I still eat enough to sustain my body, but yesterday I knew I needed to eat food.

I could barely force down some oatmeal, and even that I almost made myself throw up, which I haven't done in months.

This has never happened before, and I don't know why I panicked because usually I'm fine. So yeah anyone have any idea why that might have happened? And tips on how to prevent it? Thanks :]"
Disordered,"struggling with relapse in first week at new school  i’m seriously struggling with my anorexia again for the first time in like. three years.

i was first diagnosed with anorexia at 11 years old and hospitalized with a feeding tube, all of that. I had been struggling with my body image my entire life but the summer before sixth grade i started experimenting with fasting and calorie counting and by winter of that year i had dropped several pounds. fast forward five years, I am fully recovered, healthy, etc., don’t think twice about eating on most days.

but i’ve just started at a new school after moving and im feeling myself slip back into that mindset again. it’s such a similar circumstance and im having such identical anxieties. i hate how my clothes fit me, i resent other girls for being thinner than me, i’ve been eating only when my mom expects me to, and so on.

my ED put immense stress on my family and it has been hard to admit to myself that i’m starting to restrict again but i just can’t bring myself to approach my mom and talk to her about it. i tell myself that this time i’ll just slim down ‘this many pounds’ — i am genuinely a pudgier person, upper end of average weight bmi. i can’t stop justifying it to myself. its so infuriating.

i just wanted to vent and see if anyone else has the same struggle when school/new job starts? and how you guys cop with it? not necessarily looking for advice. i know what i should be doing lol. i’m just wanting some camaraderie."
Disordered,"My doctor is sick of me.  I've lost a lot of weight over the summer, sometimes not intentionally, and it has impacted my health. I barley noticed it at first, I thought I ate a lot and I thought I was lazy and fat, but now I'm terrified of having to gain weight again. I've been in treatment for years and refeeding has never gotten easier. Each time I go to the doctor I can tell that her patience dwindles. She's irritated and snippy, almost angry, and never asks if I have any additional questions anymore. She never tries to comfort me anymore.

Disordered,"Help & Guidance Needed Please  My 13 yo daughter has been dealing with what we/they believe is anorexia, with some overlapping in bdd. We are in the “re-feeding” portion of her op treatment, and have been stuck here for some time. My question is on her “safety” behaviors; mirror checking, skin checking, reassurance seeking and many other every day ritualistic and routine behaviors. 

Is it okay to continue to give into the behaviors and continue to reassure her with terms like: “yes you are still skinny”, “no your face is not fat”, “yes you look the same as yesterday”, etc… 

I see no harm in these repetitive behaviors (minus the worries I’d have for my daughter as a normal caring father), however I do not want to fuck this up and do not want to help the illness gain an even better foothold in my daughters life. 

…..Thoughts and advice for a worried dad?"

Disordered,You’re beautiful just the way you are  I overheard my coworkers talking about me and my weight. They invited me for a cigarette I said yes I just needed to finish up with a patient. They were talking about telling me I was beautiful just the way I was so I’d realize I shouldn’t try to be so skinny I guess? When they saw me walk by they quieted down but the damage was done and I heard them. I obviously pretended I forgot about the cigarette and just kept working. I am so tired of people telling me I’m fine just the way I am. I’m not trying to please anyone. I just want to exist and do what I please and be left alone. I don’t go around commenting on other peoples bodies saying they are beautiful just the way they are so they shouldn’t eat junk food. I just want to tell them to shut the fuck up and I’m glad they don’t like my body. I don’t want to be attractive to creepy old men anyway. Fuck them.

I first struggled with anorexia at 12 years old, so as long as I can remember I've always looked at people judging whether they're fat or skinny. I can't help it. It's like subconscious at this point. I hate to make super skinny people feel like I'm ""ogling them"". But I also hate to make fat people feel like I'm staring at them. I feel like I have no control over this. I notice people's flaws and perfections more than any person I've ever talked to. But maybe that's just because people with ED's pick apart their flaws 24/7?

i had a bad relapse these past 6 months or so due to my mother's controlling behavior and body shaming. My need to control my life and being unable to do so and essentially being her slave led me back down to this path and I am seriously underweight 

To make matters worse...i developed a bad BAD habit of hiding food my spitting it out into napkins and tossing them later because i was served giant meals (not giant by ED standards, i mean like large for regular people)

the problem is now i am trying to eat better with a meal plan from my new therapist but she wont respect it. she thinks it is waaay too small a meal plan and says shit like if i wasn't gaining before, how am i supposed to gain now? I tried lying and since i got new meds, i said my thyroid was fucked and it will get better

anyways, now i have questions. i have been trying to follow my plan but I CANNOT HANDLE THE PAAAAAIN 

it's only day 2 but holy shit, i can't even eat a serving of pasta without feeling like my stomach and chest will explode.

Recovery,"Am I crazy?  So for context I have had a diagnosed eating disorder/other mental health issues for years. I’m at a point where I am going to leave for Res soon but my OCD has been a little crazy lately. I am the oldest of all 4 of my siblings so I do the majority of the work/child caring around the house bc my parents work full time and hate being parents. One of my compulsions is that the kitchen has to be clean. For years the kitchen being clean was my responsibility, even if I didn’t make the mess. If it was dirty I got screamed at and blamed for my parents anger and the issues in our family etc. Lately my parents have been extra tired of being parents so I have been having to do the majority of the house work. It’s not just the compulsions telling me to do it, I will get screamed at if it’s not done. I have a long grocery list of issues that my parents seem to ignore until it’s beneficial for them and then when I say “hey this is somewhat challenging for me” I get met with anger and accusations. 
“Why is it so hard”? 
 “This shouldn’t be an issue for you if you were trying to get better” 
Essentially making me feel like shit for being messed up in the head. Like I’m only creating more issues with my problems.
My friends and extended family have a running joke where they call me Cinderella because I do the majority of cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, and child caring. 
Lately I’ve noticed that my parents and siblings have been doing absolutely nothing around the house because they know I have to clean it. I feel like they take advantage of my compulsions and anxiety and leave it all for me. They complain when they have to do one thing, while I’m busting my ass to do everything. I feel like they know if they leave a mess I will clean it. I even ask them nicely if they will clean it. They obviously don’t do it, but my brain won’t let me not clean it. At this point I’m really sick and tired of it. Am I crazy for feeling like my family is taking advantage of my compulsions and anxiety just so they don’t have to do things?"

On the one hand, I’ve been purge free for two weeks. Except when I say purge free, I mean that I haven’t forced myself to throw up, or use laxatives. Yes, these were really hard to stop after so long, but my body literally cannot keep up anymore. Last time I purged so hard, I nearly passed out in the bathroom (I live alone too). 

Recovery has really fucked with my body image, and I’m gaining weight and I know my body needs it, but I can’t help but break the feeling that I need to earn my meals.

Disordered,"Insecurity Projection  Ughh... I ""caught"" my period this week after not having it for 2 months and I already feel HUGE and just not me. Today, I went out to lunch with a female relative of mine (to whom I attribute much of my disordered eating and thinking) and as I was eating a sandwich, she asks me, ""So are you still watching what you eat?"" I was so confused, so she reiterated, ""...like, calories?"" I replied with a nervous laugh, I just didn't know what to say. ""Well, you look >very thin."" Ok, well I do not think I am and I've been trying to lose weight and I know that I'm relapsing hard-core. This relative has the audacity to tell me she's gained weight and that it's for the best, then asks how much I weigh. All that just to ""gentle brag"" about your weight. Some people never change.

I feel hollow. I know it's not that big a deal, but I haven't dealt with that toxicity in years and I had forgotten how bad it was. Now I remember."
Disordered,I'm fairly young 16 and would like advice from people suffering in a similar way  I've been underweight my whole life sometimes I don't eat for the majority of the day. Sometimes the only reason I eat is because I'm shaking so bad it makes things difficult. I'm not particularly ashamed of my body I would prefer if I was a bit bulkier but that's it. I would like to speak to anyone I'd this is a sign I'm falling into anorexianervosa or if I'm just lazy. Knowing whether or not I'm overreacting would be much appreciated thank you in advance.
Recovery,"what was the one reason that helped you to recover?  tried recovering for months, hasn't really worked, but i am tired of all this. i want to recover. i want to get better. i just need to find the one thing taht's gonna make me move."
Recovery,"is this normal?  It's very hot outside and I'm sweating and feel hot, but my arms and legs are really cold. I didn't notice until I put my arm on my forehead. I don't know if this has something to do with AN or if this is normal. I know a lot of people feel cold all the time, but I feel hot even though my body is cold. Can anyone help me?"
Disordered,"I got fat-shamed even though I'm thin  I live in a foster home with 3 kids I hate. Last night I was complaining of the noise they were making. One of them started referring to me with female pronouns (I’m a transgender male). I went and asked her why she was doing that and she was like “Cus you’re a girl. You’ve got a fanny and boobs. You’re a girl” and I could barely sleep because I was so offended. She doesn’t realise that gender identity is not the same thing as sex. Before I lost weight the same person used to fat-shame me and call me a crybaby and act really transphobic towards me. If she acts more transphobic, then it must be a sign she thinks I’m fat. It makes sense - the more weight I gain, the more feminine and curvaceous my body looks. Even when I lost a lot of weight she told me to “wear a bra” and thought my breasts were big even though I was skinny. I’m much bigger than her, she is very dainty and petite, so I look like a fat curvy whale when compared to her. Is telling a transgender male something like “You’re a girl, you’ve got a fanny and boobs” fat-shaming in disguise?"
Disordered,"Does anyone else feel the need to go to the bathroom and “doing your business” before getting weighed??  It probably sounds really weird. But I always go to the bathroom before getting weighed, to make sure that I don’t have any extra weight on/in me😅"
Disordered,I passed out at work  I've been restricting more than usual lately and it's been making me feel really light headed for the past week. I ended up fainting at work a few days ago but I work in a hospital so nurses were around me and they were asking me if I had eaten. I said I didn't but because I didn't have time to before work (i work morning shift) even though that's a lie. They ended up making me go to the emergency depart because my blood pressure was really low and they started asking me about my medical history so I told them I have ana and now I'm scared my colleagues are going to find out somehow. Like I know they're not allowed to look at my file or anything but now I'm just worried they'll find out.
Disordered,"I’m at my smallest  I’ve been worried that I’ve been gaining weight as I had not been weighing myself, but I was getting so freaking hungry so I decided to weigh myself just to check if I could afford to eat some more then I saw that I had dropped quite a bit more weight, I did treat myself with extra food that I’m now feeling terrible for eating but I couldn’t Sleep I could only think about food plus I’m supposed to be eating cause I have internal damage to my bowel system and it’s relearning how to work and I keep telling myself this so I don’t feel bad I’m still so hungry I feel like I can never be full then sometimes I forget how to eat and chewing hurts my jaw, I’m so grossly sick now my hair constantly falling out, my eye bags are huge I can’t sleep for the life of me I bruise so easily I constantly think about food and how bad I want it but I just can’t have it cause I can’t handle the idea of gaining weight, I’m a grown adult and I weigh less more then I did as a young teen and I still feel fat I don’t understand me"

Disordered,"big tw vent  i feel like shit i hate eating so much the feeling of fullness makes my skin crawl. im sitting here debating wether to purge or not because all it does is make my face puffy and i hate that too. every time i swallow food i can feel myself getting fat. i don’t know why i eat because this is just a fucking cycle i feel like this every single time and yet i always end up eating something. i hate it. there’s a piece of my brain that’s mad at myself too because it wasn’t even a binge just a normal meal and i cant stop ripping myself apart for it. fuck . i want to crawl out of my body and go to sleep forever i work a job where i’m on my feet all day, 6:30am-7:30pm every day except thursdays and i’m on call during weekends. i despise not being at work because i feel like such a lazy unproductive piece of shit. no matter how much i exercise during the day i still feel so fucking gross knowing i wasn’t running around all day. fuck fuck fuck"
Disordered,Y’all I’ve been home alone all day and just binged my calorie limit in one meal 😅  
Recovery,"Quitting Exercise  This is going to be the hardest thing I have done probably in my entire life. Basically the one constant disordered behavior I have had for my whole experience with anorexia has been excessive exercise. It started 2.5 years ago. What I mean to say is that basically I can not even comprehend what a day without exercising even looks like. But at this point I’m done with my bullshit. I have had a normal enough relationship with food for ~6 months now and I just want to prove to myself that I do not have to be held back at all by this disorder. I know I can do this because I have overcome so much already. I just don’t know what I will do now. I don’t really have any friends, basically all I can do all day is play video games and read which are my only hobbies. I’m getting off topic so I’ll leave it at that."
Recovery,"No appetite anymore after extreme appetite  Well I’ve had 0 hunger (mental or physical) and 0 appetite the last 7 days so I made it a whole 1.5 days into “all in”which was more like 25% all in, and then just failed 
You know what I also realized is I’ve relapsed into doing more steps again. I wonder if this moving more has a correlation with why my appetite has gone away again?
I know all in is what will need to be done, as the slow approach failed for me heavily."
Disordered,"I'm getting pizza in 3 hours, and I'm already anxious  I know I shouldn't be logically. One meal won't make a difference. But I'm so anxious. I can't even get myself to eat anything before dinner. 

I hate this disorder lmao."
Disordered,How much water do y’all drankkkk  How much h20 u consume on the daily yo and does it affect yo weight
Disordered,"Muscle Fatigue  For the past month or so i’ve found it really hard to do daily things because my muscles are really fatigued. I physically have to walk really slowly i can’t really walk very far without feeling like my legs will give way. I also can’t lift anything remotely heavy without my arms feeling extremely tired after. 
Does anyone else get this or is it something not related to my disorder at all?"
Disordered,struggling to recover  i want to recover but it’s such a struggle i can only eat foods that my brain thinks are safe and good and when i eat the bad foods i have to get rid of it somehow i’m so scared that this will be my life forever but i just can’t recover it’s so hard
Disordered,"Mom is forcing me to gain weight  My mom is forcing me to eat more and more so I can gain weight and I’m so fucking scared I feel sick. I’m so tired of hearing my family’s comments everyday about my body and food bc apparently I “look like a stick and I need to get help” which isn’t true at all, like I’m not even that thin? Their conception of being skinny is so messed bc being overweight is low key the standard where I live. So I need to give up on trying to restrict bc I’m so sick of arguing with my parents. I didn’t tell her I’m anorexic tho (so she doesn’t take me to therapy or wtv plus I don’t even think I need it) I don’t wanna gain back the weight I lost and I’m so scared of looking like the way I used to. I’ll never achieve my dream body and I feel like I’ll be stuck like this forever. I hate this so much it’s making me sick idk what to do atp"
Disordered,"Looking at pictures of myself when i was bigger last night is triggering me hard right now  I was seeing how fat i used to be and how skinny ive been getting (not super skinny) and its just giving me the urge to make me like myself for by starving but i know it wont work, im trying to get myself to eat but i wont let myself get out of bed"
Disordered,weight gain  in hospital recovery put on some weight just finding it hard to deal with I know it for my best but now whenever I eat I feel like I'm just putting on more and more and feel like I don't need to be eating as much as I'm being given I also feel like I won't want to eat food I love when I get out
Disordered,"Triggered by my aunt  It’s my birthday today, and so we went to visit my aunt yesterday and spent the night, to have a celebration. And yesterday there was a lot of snacks, different chocolates and other sweets. I decided to just have some, and to take as many as I would like. 
It made me feel really guilty, but I decided to ignore the ED thoughts to the best of my ability. I started to think “what if my aunt thinks I eat a lot? What if my parents think I’m greedy? 

Well, today she gave me a birthday present. I got a pack of the same chocolates I snacked on yesterday. And she then told me “you ate so many of them yesterday, so I figured you would like a pack of them!”. 

She probably didn’t realize how triggering her comment was. But now I feel really guilty, greedy, and horrible. I already feared that I would gain weight since I’ve been eating more than I initially had planned. And because I also ate a lot more yesterday, plus snacks, and plus getting the comment…. I’m almost certain that I’ve gained weight. At my appointment in the beginning of this week i had gained. And I really don’t want it to happen again. Another weight gain would make my relapse even worse… 

How do I stop feeling this horrible?? I just want to go home, so that I’m able to restrict my food again."
Recovery,"Jennette McCurdy and Im Glad My Mom Died book release  Is anyone else super happy that Jennete McCurdy's new book talks so openly about eating disorders? Specifically anorexia and bulimia. She touches on the unspoken eating disorder hierarchys that exist among those with disordered eating as well as different aspects of her disorder. So vulnerable and inspiring, im dying to get my hands on a copy.

I watched an interview where she was explaining the problem with the idea that recovery is a long ongoing process is negative and that discarding that mentality helped her recover, along with seaking an eating disorder specialist. I feel like we need more perspectives giving raw input on this topic, and this feels like a large step towards making eating disorders more talked about since theyre such a prevalent issue as we all know too well.
 
Sadly, I noticed that in the most recent interviews where she is speaking about the book, she has had to answer to the medias questions regarding her sxperience on ICarly which she obviously feels uncomfortable speaking on when trying to explain her book. Its undermining the message and many aspects of the media will always just suck.

I also noticed (as a person with anorexia who hyperfixates on bodies) that she is looking thinner than she did even a few months ago based on podcasts I have seen her on. Im concerned for her well being and I really hope being in the public eye hasn't triggered a relapse. I might be reading too much into it but I just wish the best for her fr.

She said, shes chunky, chunkier than you. I immediately laughed it off and kinda started crying. She immediately started apologizing but now it's all I can think about.

It’s this feeling of not feeling sick enough anymore eventhough I know I am"
Disordered,isolation  this illness makes me want to be alone. i hate eating with others because people notice i’m not eating or am eating very little or am only eating very low calorie stuff. sometimes i just wanna be alone so i can starve in peace :/
Disordered,"Really wondering how much I weigh after just taking photos of myself  It hit me today. I looked in the mirror and I am noticing that I’m underweight. Not extremely underweight but I do appear borderline underweight. I haven’t weighed myself in years because it gives me panic attacks. I don’t even think we own a scale in my house and I definitely can’t ask my mom for one. I haven’t seen my body look like this since high school anorexia, and I’m not even mad about it. I’m happy. I feel good at this weight. I’m just really curious how much I weigh. I’m genuinely happier when I am bordering underweight, I feel better in my body, I have clarity, better energy, I’m not swollen and inflamed, etc.  on one hand it would be nice to know how much I weigh just to know, but if that number is higher than I want then it would only make my Ed worse. :/"
Disordered,"Can anyone relate?  
I’m a hardcore perfectionist, but it has always been for nothing. I’ve never been a dancer/performer, musician, a high income earner with a prestigious job. Hell, I never even made it to the Honor Roll in high school. I didn’t finish college and I tried multiple times. I’m just a mediocre barely adult with an eating disorder. And my brain convinces me that my AN diagnosis isn’t valid because it’s b/p subtype and not ✨pure✨restriction."
Disordered,"Convince me I'll be fine if I eat a cookie  My dad just brought home these super nice cookies, I tried one, and it tasted so damn good, but now I can't stop thinking about them, I just wanna eat another, but this stupid disorder won't let me, I fucking hate this illness."
Disordered,"Anorexia vs Treatment  So I’m supposed to be going to a (very expensive) inpatient treatment centre for general psychiatry (not ED) in a month or two. I also happen to currently be in the hospital for general psych for not being safe or functioning at all. Along with this has come a relapse with my anorexia and I don’t know what to do. In order for me to go to this treatment centre I have to be over a certain BMI, and I am getting dangerously close to that cutoff weight. I’m trying to make myself eat more but every time I do I feel sick physically and the eating disorder screams at me. If I did not have this treatment coming up I would be in full on relapse, doing other old bad ED behaviours. I guess I don’t know what do. I have no support with eating even though I’m in the hospital so it’s all on me. I really want to go to this program though. I reached out to an ED helpline just now so hopefully they’ll respond in the morning. I need serious help"
Disordered,"Vent: dysphori-ugggh      Ughhhhhh, I think I'm relapsing. I was doing good with recovery for 3 or 4 years but after health issues caused me to loose a lot of weight over the past year and I gained most of it back, I can't stand the thought  of gaining more. I say I just want to lose x pounds but honestly I know once I do, if I do, I'll want to lose more and more.
  I would be fine with my weight and body if it wasn't for my boobs. I'm nonbinary and my chest makes me so dysphoric. My binder helps a lot, but being home exacerbates the issue. I keep getting misgendered day in and day out and I can't stand it. My body dysphoria stems from my gender dysphoria.
  I'm hoping that instead of worsening the lapse school will make it better. I'll be in an environment where I can control my food, surrounded by friends and support, where I'll be engaged and distracted from food. School should make it better. I just need to survive 2 more weeks and hopefully NOT relapse (like I'm planning how to do) when I go back. I should probably tell my friends for accountability, but I don't want to burden them with this. 
  Also medical dietary restrictions can suck my ass. It makes restriction too easy at home. I like that I gained enough weight to stabilize my joints, and allow me to move, exercise, and function comfortably, but I hate knowing what the healthier low end is for my body. Basically chronic illness (EDS  gang), gender dysphoria, and being home for the summer are utterly tanking my mental health."
Disordered,"Horrendous craving for pancakes  Just need to vent that I am desperately craving pancakes with banana, syrup and peanut butter. I have purged the last few nights and don’t want to do it again tonight (desperately trying not to make a habit of it). This sucks :("

She seems to think I have a fear of fats and talks about it constantly. I’ve explained to her that’s about calories multiple times. It’s been 2 years now and she still talks about my fear of fats and now it HAS turned into that on top of everything else. How can I get her to stop? I’m an adult and even my therapist has told her. Nothing helps

Disordered,"Feeling judged by people and my ED When taking the initiative to eat something  I said to my friend who was coming over to my place for a sleepover that i dont have any snacks at home and that we should buy.

Disordered,"Things people don't understand about anorexia nervosa  That your stomach can hurt after eating only a small amount of food, because the stomach has shrunk and you get full easily. that's why it's not easy to ""just eat more.""

That your brain gets affected by malnourishment, so people can tell you that you are endangering your health, and you don't hear them. but deep down, you realize this. this illness is difficult to stop, without support

That anorexia isn't about vanity or looking a certain way. For most people, it's about being in pain and not being able to cope in a healthy way

That it's one of the most dangerous eating disorders you can have, and hard to cure, but not impossible. recovery can take years, and the earlier you treat the illness, the better chance you have at a full recovery

That it is an isolating, painful and destructive disorder to have to endure. there's nothing fun about it. there's nothing to be admired about it. 

That it isn't done for attention. most people want to be left alone and do not want help, yet want help at the same time.  it's not just a phase that will pass, it's an serious illness that can lead to death"

I don’t know what to do I really want the weight back but I just can’t make myself eat."
Disordered,"Work cookout!  I work with all men and every couple weeks they pull out the grill and cook up burgers and hotdogs for a cute little employee cookout. The past two I haven’t eaten a single thing. I feel like they all know but never make me feel bad about it. Today my manager asked me if I was going to eat and said he got specific cheese for me (because he knows I’m dairy free). I’m proud of myself for saying yes to eating, mostly because I don’t want to let anyone down as they’ve already purchased all the food to cook. Today is going to be the one day I eat like a normal person and I hope that I can manage to not feel sick after I do eat a hot dog or a cheeseburger. I just won’t eat the bun! (I’m gluten free).

Recovery,"I think I'm getting better  I've started eating a bit more recently because I wanted to avoid the low blood sugar symptoms that kept preventing from finishing my workouts. I was scared I would gain inches but I'd lost some to my surprise, I'd even gained a bit of muscle. I still struggle with guilt when I do eat, I have to remind myself having more muscles and working out means I need more fuel and so I won't get fat. Sometimes I want to relapse when I think I'm not lean enough for the kind of muscle mass I want but I'm trying to fight through that. I think I'm going to cut off contact with a cousin who keeps calling me sexy, he thinks it's a compliment but it does the opposite. It just reminds me I haven't lost enough weight to lose my curves. This has turned more into a rant but I really think I'm ready to start getting better"
Disordered,"God i hope people understood what stuff to say  I had a horrible eating disorder 3ish months ago.

I'm so angry at the people i love tho. My dad keeps talking about calories and how my stomach buldges out in particular dresses and stuff after me telling him a million times not to on a daily basis. My mom and partner had been a bit supportive but they sometimes so get on my nerves too. Yesterday i had finished exercising and i was extremely hungry and there was no food at home so i made some ramen. Only later to hear from my mom about how i did wrong by eating unhealthy and stuff. I stood up for myself saying nothing is bad cause that's what my therapist told me. She told me to eat anything i could when I'm hungry. But nvm, my mom didn't understand and kept saying it. Later i was telling my partner about this incident and he just said he agrees with her and that i did wrong by eating that. I just told him I'll ttyl and left. Now i also have a recent history of self harm. I was doing fine but recently after both my parents and partner said stuff regarding unhealthy foods and calories and stuff I've really been wanting to hurt myself or start stopping to eat again.

Tonight, I think I experienced my first big panic attack about my body size after shaving my legs and seeing just how fat my legs are. So regardless of the fact that I hardly ate anything today and spend most of the day on my hands and knees cleaning, I went on an hour long walk tonight too. Several times on that walk I started to feel faint. My vision kinda shifted for a second at one point, but I kept going and didn't stop to rest at all.

im a failure and i can't handle it so i take it out on everyone else.  i mess up everything, i can't even have fucking anorexia properly i have to convince everyone who deals with me that im not a lying sack of shit.  i just hate myself, i miss restricting even though its only been a couple weeks and idek why im trying to eat normally because all it does is upset me and then everyone else gets in a bad mood because im no fun to be around

Recovery,"Sexual gratification from eating?  Okay this is… a really weird one, and please only reply if you’re an adult as I’m 24 and am not comfortable discussing this with minors.

MINORS GO AWAY! DO NOT READ AND DNI! 

Okay so…

Since my anorexia has gotten to its worst, I’ve found that when I eat a big meal after a couple weeks of severe restriction, it gives me sexual gratification. Like… I feel sexually aroused from eating something extremely sugary or eating fast food after restricting for awhile. I’ve also noticed a similar thing with the hunger pangs after not eating for awhile.

I feel… so weird and gross about this. I’ve never had any sort of food kink before, and it makes me feel disgusting. I just want to know if anyone else at all has gone through something similar or if I’m just exceptionally weird.

Thank you guys so much in advance."

Disordered,"I’m hungry, I want to eat more, I crave ice cream, cookies and just food in general. But I’m unable to let myself have any more food today…can someone give me advice??:((  "
Disordered,scared  guys i’m really scared. my anorexia has gotten really bad and i’m dropping weight super fast and i’m scared im gonna die. im scared of all the health complications too. i don’t know how to stop but i also can’t find the willingness to get a nutritionist. im terrified.
Disordered,I've been doing pretty good with food latey and then today  the mozzarella in my salad was bad so I ended up ordering binge food. I hate this so much
Disordered,"Is this a binge?  I’ve been heavily restricting for a couple of months now. But I’m home right now for vacation and for my parents sake (long story) I’ve been trying to eat normally even though it’s REALLY tough. What started as a n act that I’m eating a little bit more than what I usually eat, soon became something like a recovery ( not a full on actual one, but more like temporary).  I guess this was because I’m at my lowest weight right now and I’m scared? EVERYONE i see are telling me how sick and malnourished i look. So i think that made me eat a tiny bit more? 
So the thing is, today is the last day im home and I’ll be leaving tomorrow, and what started as a evening snack ( a kiwi and guava) soon became something like a binge? I haven’t binged before so idk if this is it, but I pretty much ate loads of savoury stuff ( im not even exaggerating it’s more than what normal healthy people eat)  , a entire bar of chocolate, a pack of biscuits etc. im already planning on going back to restriction once i get back to uni, but the thought that dominated my mind was like i have to eat as much as I can at home and go back to restricting, and i said to myself I shouldn’t do this again. So is this a binge? Is it a sign i should start recovery, but i do have heavy restricting thoughts still. Idk why i did this im confused? Am i going to binge here on ? What is it ? Someone helppp

Update: ashamed af to say this but I purged…not entirely what I ate, but almost half of it🥲"
Disordered,No. It’s not a choice.  
Recovery,"The most liberating thing about recovery  I spoke with my family doctor the other day & she suggested I eat 4 times a day & just eat what I can physically handle. It doesn’t have to be a full meal but over time I’ll be able to eat more. Since I’ve been eating 4 times a day, I noticed that I get hungry earlier. Most days I don’t have my first meal until 7-9 pm. Today, I didn’t feel like eating bc I wasn’t hungry but I made myself eat something small bc I relapse so quickly and I’m trying to avoid that. I think I can get through this 💕"
Recovery,is it just me  when i eat i have a focus on protein. i’m so scared to eat fruit on its own since it could lead to blood sugar spikes that will give you cravings. so when i eat i have higher volume still very low cal but abnormally high in protein meals. i’m just wondering if anyone else is like this or if it’s just me. cause protein is also suuuuper filling.
Recovery,insides feel like garbage  is this normal especially when i eat
Disordered,"The absolute biggest scam is thinking that you will love your body once you finally reach your goal weight, whatever that may be  I know this is not at all an original thought, but damn is it the truth. I really relapsed and wasted the last few years of my life being absolutely miserable and for what. I am unhealthy and I became utterly miserable, but I sure hit that goal. And then the next and the next. And I only got more miserable with time. I just wish this is what I could communicate to those just falling into disorder. Or that me saying it would make any kind of difference for them. But just know that it’s really really true. It will not make you happy. It won’t make you love yourself. You won’t ever be satisfied. Shit will just hit the fan until you have to make a change, or one is made for you. This is just my personal experience and opinion but I just want it to be known and really heard. So so much love to all. Please take care of yourselves, please"
Disordered,"Im so close to comitting to it and destroying myself  I have never had an eating disorder but ive been dealing and battling the thoughts of purging and starving until theres nothing left. The worst part is, i feel like i have no right to say im dealing with anything because im not a cis woman (dumb, ik.) i am so close to running to the bathroom and doing it now, i cant get help either."
Recovery,"finally made an appointment  I finally made an appointment for myself to establish care with a doctor. I've seen doctors before, of course, but it was always either the emergency room or my OBGYN. I am a 33 year old woman and this is a first for me. Kinda proud of myself. 

Immediately after making the appointment, though, my brain said ""must lose as much as possible before appointment."" 

Aaaaand that's mental illness. 

Awesome."
Disordered,"I've been getting everyone worried  My parents, my brother, sister-in-law, my GRANDMA... They're all worried. They all keep telling me to ""not thin too much"", but I need it I just can't help it. My dad's away and I'm over here making everyone feel awful more than they already do. I've also hit a new LW, I can't go back and gain it again, I can't stop counting my cals either. I don't wanna be forced to have ""the talk"". I hate myself and I feel like the worst, I don't know what to do."
Disordered,trigger warning- calories  does anyone else stress out that their calorie counts are wrong and you’re accidentally eating way more calories than you think? please tell me this isn’t just me.
Disordered,i feel TERRIBLE  i’ve been on a starvation diet so there’s no doubt i’ve lost weight but i am SO CONSTIPATED that my stomach is distended. i literally feel pregnant and even though i’ve lost weight i feel fat bc of my constipation stomach. im DONE!!! somebody please tell me this has happened to them too.
Disordered,"were you a runner?  i really am passionated about running, don't get me wrong here. i love it and used to run everyday (pre-ed, not weight loss driven). but god, suffering from a mix of anorexia is very limiting because i don't wanna lose too much weight (as i am already severely underweight) but because of my ed, i don't wanna eat more either in order to get away from the fear of considerable weight loss lol. also, i always prefered long distance running sessions so it's not healthy/safe at all in my case. how do you cope from being underweight AND into running? i miss it so much."
Recovery,"My sister has recently relapsed with her ED  My sister has been hospitalized twice during the past year, recently our parents went abroad with our little brothers while we stay here and work. I thought things were going well for her, as she seemed to greatly improve on the mental side of things. However I did notice how she lost some weight and bought a scale (in hindsight this should of been an immediate red flag). I had noticed her getting more frail but I did not connect the dots.

&#x200B;

about 30 mins ago my mother called to inform me how she is going to be re-hospitalized in September. This has taken a large toll on my sister, she is not yet home from her psychiatric appointment, I just want to support her the best I can. I feel like if I bring it up she will just get upset with me. Her boyfriend who I am very close with is also quite skinny as he works long hours as a chef. They don't really bring out the best in each-other. 

&#x200B;

I want to talk to my sister tonight and try to be as open as possible and show her as much support as possible. Does anyone here have a suggestion as to how I might approach this with her? I love her very much, we are super close and I hate to see her spiral again."
Recovery,"cold 247  is anyone else severely cold all the time? so ever since my ed i’ve always been cold. probably due to iron deficiency however it’s been so much worse lately. i go outside in 87° weather and i only think that it’s warm. even showering is difficult since the air is cold and the water even on the hottest setting, doesn’t feel that hot. i cant focus on my classes because of the cold and when i mention it to my friends they all say, “it’s so hot what are you talking about”. i can definitely feel the humidity but the heat is barely getting to me"
Disordered,"I’ve reached a normal weight, but my anorexic thoughts are louder than ever….  I’m physically not “ill” anymore, I have reached a normal weight, and I’ve been able to maintain it for a while. But I feel much more ill with anorexia now than ever before. I have started to restrict again, because I want to become underweight again. I want to have an empty stomach, I want to see the number on the scales go down. I restricted last week, but I managed to GAIN a lot of weight. I really don’t understand why and how. The weight gain triggered me to continue restricting, and now it’s all I can think of. 

But it kinda feels impossible to lose weight, because I don’t trust my body anymore. I fear that I won’t lose any weight, no matter how much I restrict or not. I’ve also started to watch documentaries about people with anorexia, the same documentaries I’ve watched multiple times before. I only watch them to trigger myself into continue restricting and eating as little as possible. I feel so defeated whenever I eat more than planned, and get an urge to punish myself for eating. 

My therapist told me at our appointment earlier this week that I’ve come a long way in recovery, and how I’m at a much better place now than when we first started talking. It kinda feels like she doesn’t realize how bad I’m actually doing right now. But at the same time, I don’t want her to find out. Because if she finds out that I’ve started restricting again, she’s going to refer me to a different outpatient facility. And I really don’t want to see a different therapist, since my overall relationship with my therapist is pretty good. 


Does anyone else relate to this? And you do you have any advice on what to do?"
Disordered,"Doctors being annoying  Seriously...   
Yesterday i had yet another appointment, full of the same old tired bullshit, another dumb pointless weigh in, pulse check and blood pressure check.  


Treating me as if I'm dying or something.  


then he proceeds to yet again tell me i need to recover, and when i yet again say no he proceeds to threaten me with hospitals if I ""don't stop eventually""...  


No, I don't want to recover, not now, i need to actually be thin first ugh  
Its just idk

I feel like every other anorexic girl gets to be thin in recovery, but i'm just casually asked to continue being obese, how can anyone want to recover under those circumstances?  


Like fuck me, i so so wish recovery was an option for me, if i just wasn't fat i would have done it already"
Disordered,stressed about eating out  what can i do?
Disordered,"(Trigger Warning) First time hearing “you’re so thin!”.  Last night, I posted a harmless selfie in a subreddit just expecting nice comments and whatnot because i was feeling a bit down, and I get a DM from someone telling me I’m so thin and asked if I work out. This is the first time I’ve ever heard this before and I don’t really know how to feel. Lol."
Disordered,"me  Me not eating the food on the counter and then crying three hours later when someone else eats it, bc really I wanted it but I was too scared to have it but now I don't even have the option of it anymore"
Disordered,"Health prob wonderings  Does anorexia make you have fevers? Recently ive started experiencing a lot of health problems, incl fevering/difficulty breathing/high heart rate/palpitations/heart burn/nausea/dizziness/hair falling out on and off this week but i dont think I’m at a “low enough weight” to be for sure considered anorexic? Is it still possible to have these symptoms with an ed?"
Disordered,"I'm just tired. All the time.  I'm exhausted. All the time. I wake up and I immediately want to go back to sleep. I take a nap, and I'm still tired. My eyes are always heavy, my mind is always somewhere else. 

And I don't know if it's just because I don't have enough energy in me to do anything else because I'm not eating enough or because of the never-ending depression inside of me or if it's just a combination, an amalgamation of both of them. 

Whatever it is - I hate it. It feels like there is absolutely nothing I can do to change it. I know I could eat more and that could probably help (my fingernails are constantly blue these days), but I just don't have any motivation and can't seem to actually do it. I'm just so tired of fighting this all the time. 

And if I can't do this stuff. If I can't do the basics of eating and sleeping. How am I supposed to find a job and work and live? It just seems impossible."

It’s five days and I don’t know if I can handle eating three meals plus snacks.

Disordered,"DAE listen to podcasts about food addiction?  Because I do. I basically binge them and eat them up. No pun intended. But I don’t think I am a food addict like these people on the podcasts. Maybe at one point of my life I was addicted to foods, but it was never fast food, unhealthy stuff. It was “healthy” deemed foods. But now I’m realizing that maybe it was a low key addiction to sugar. Even if the sugar is from fruit or healthy sources.  Now, I am deep within my restriction and I don’t feel addicted to food. I’m just restricting it and when I eat, I eat the orthorexia foods  that work with my body.  I do have certain veggies and snacks that I can eat volume of. But I don’t feel sick or gross after so it’s definitely not a binge. Idk where I’m at anymore. But I keep listening to podcasts about food addiction and I guess I’m just confused. Am I a food addict or am I just deep in my raging Ed with the desire to lose more weight."

I hate how people in my own family occasionally eat pizza so I have to see it in my house. I hate how my entire country is full of addicting unhealthy food that I would love to eat. I cannot remember the last time I had pizza (or any fast food), but I think about it constantly. I also hate how dangerous biking is here and how necessary having a car is for transportation.

Disordered,"I think I realized today I have a problem…  My story may be triggering because I’m confused and want context for y’all’s opinions :( 

I’m 27 years old and I’ve had a very rough year I got very sick with stomach ulcers and began a bad food intake habit. I started shedding weight QUICKLY (I was a bigger girl too). I became self obsessed tbh I didn’t wanna stop I started liking myself again… and at the time not eating or little to none was easy because of the pain. But, it became more very fast, I realized I started pushing myself to not eat, then started to actually push the hunger away, and the scale was obsessive, the compliments kept me going and then BAM. I looked in the mirror one day and was confused, I was skinny but my face is aging, my body is weak, I’m tired all the time, I can’t stand up without getting light headed, I sit in the shower, my hairs falling out, heart palpitations regularly, every morning it’s hard to breathe. But my blood pressure and pulse is fine when I go to the doctors.
I start therapy tomorrow but I’m anxious. 
Sometimes I eat 1 meal and some small snacks a day which makes me feel like it’s not really as bad as my body feels? If that makes sense but I started research it’s a year now I’ve been doing this. I’m anemic now, and My face is so sad looking and my skin isn’t right. I don’t look healthy anymore. I haven’t weighed myself in a month and I’m spiraling over it because the body dysmorphia.

Disordered,"when a family member confronts you  im so shaken up. after a long day of running errands (and genuinely forgetting to pack snacks) i came home and was planning on making a sandwich. i havent had a sandwich in such a long time, but i really wanted one and was going to treat myself because i had been so incredibly busy today.

so as i start making it she approached me and asked what id eaten today. then she told me shes been watching me and she knows everything. i just stare at her and im trying not to cry. shes not hugging me, or asking if im ok. she had the worst look in her eyes. she knows my history of anxiety and panic attacks so i dont know why she is confront me like this, right before im about to eat, especially.

she started questioning me about various moments over the past few months. at this point i cannot bring myself to finish making my sandwich. and my anxiety levels are skyrocketing. she kept bringing up past incidents at doctors offices and at home and says she's gonna be watching me from now on. says this time she wont take any excuses. i bought some of my usual safe food from a store today and she asked me why i buy those super specific foods, and what i think im doing. i just had no response.

for dinner tonight she made homemade fried chicken and all of that oil made me nauseous but i forced myself to quietly eat two plates in front of her. i didnt go on my usual run tonight and shes been ignoring me since. to be fair i haven't talked to her either. but its because i dont know what to do. im so bloated because of how much sodium i forced myself to consume. i didnt enjoy it at all. i feel so nervous and scared.

has anyone been in a similar situation. or can offer words of advice. i feel absolutely terrified right now. worst way to start my week. im mad at myself and mad at her for bringing it up in an angry way and right before i was about to eat, too. i dont know how im ever gonna eat in front of her again, knowing shes watching my every move. i dont know the next steps from here. why couldnt she have just asked me if i was ok or tried to comfort me. i feel so terrible"

Disordered,"I'm scared of recovery.  Everyone says if you recover you'll become fat and have saggy skin, cellulite, etc. Because you fucked up your metabolism, so if you start recovering you'll become fat since you're in starvation mode and your body will hold onto everything and make you fat, and that you won't have muscle so your skin will be untoned and saggy. And they said you'll start binging.

I wasn't planning to have more then but my sister (who also is trying to recover from AN) brought back donuts and encouraged me to have one. Now donuts are one of the foods i fear most, and i kept trying to say no but my sister kept insisting on challenging them with me, so i took one in order to not trigger her further. then i spent like 3h crying because of how guilty i felt, and even now i'm feeling guilty because i feel like i ate too much yesterday. can someone tell me was that normal for someone recovering from AN? like for both the food and the feelings?"

Disordered,"sidney gish (and other artists who subtly mention ED)  i have been (relatively) recovered from my ED for a few years now, and one of my favorite artists, sidney gish, mentions her ED in subtle ways in her music -- she doesn't glorify ED, but writes about her past experiences now that she is (presumably) recovered. here are some examples:

[""it's afternoon, I'm feeling sick""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLVKLzYvOK8&ab_channel=SidneyGish) -- mentions reflecting on ""the days [she] used to diet hard..."", talks about restricting in a bittersweet way -- it is a part of her but she is glad to be at a point where she can look back and recognize her eating habits used to be bad

[""mouth log""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxiA3b4zXYI&ab_channel=SidneyGish-Topic) -- a song about keeping lists on your phone about things that go in your mouth, such as food logs or a list of people you've kissed (it sounds silly when i type it out like this but she executes it extremely intelligently)

Like I started making excuses to eat less, or not eat at all, and sometimes I blurt it out before my brain even gets the time to process what I want to answer. And I get really near panic attacks when I feel full sometimes but not always. I don't know how bad this could become because it's not like- bad rn, I just- I don't know.

Disordered,"Jealous of smokers  I live in a kid’s home with 3 other kids and 2 of them smoke tobacco and vape. They hide in their bedrooms all day long, without eating or interacting with others, and only leave in the late afternoon or evening. I rarely see them eat and if they do it’s their only meal of the day. They slowly and apathetically toy with their food and get really distracted by their phones and can’t finish an entire normal-sized meal. It really triggers my eating disorder and makes me feel so envious. There is also this kid in my home who doesn’t smoke but he plays video games all day long and constantly needs reminding to eat. In the morning he is asked if he wants some breakfast and he almost always says no. I hate how big my appetite is and how I easily blaze through 3 meals and 3 snacks a day and still feel ravenously hungry. I feel so fat and greedy when compared to them. I ask the staff if I eat more than them and they don’t think I do but I genuinely think I eat the most. I wish I had access to cigarettes (or other stimulants such as speed) so I could completely lose my appetite and sense of taste as if by magic. I don’t care about my health. All I care about is eating less and losing weight. It’s so hard to recover from an eating disorder when you are constantly surrounded by people who smoke or get way too distracted by video games to eat."

Disordered,"Am I Crazy/Should I get help?  Hi, in 2014-2016 I think i struggled with an eating disorder (restricted, purged, obsessed over food etc) but when I sought medical advice to see if I did have an ED the doctor said “well you look fine to me”. Ever since then I’ve always felt like my eating disorder was a lie, or all in my head, or i was just making it all up for attention.

Fast forward to 1 month ago, i feel like i relapsed, but idk if i can even say that because idk if i even had a real eating disorder before. But within this 1 month, ive lost enough weight in a significant way, and now i am def underweight. If i were to seek medical attention though would this be considered to be anorexia? I definitely fit all the other criteria just worried if it still goes by a *certain weight number* in order to be officially diagnosed. I just really don’t feel like being invalidated by the health care system for a number is an experience that might be helpful to right now. 

But am also experiencing other health issues I’m not sure i should go to the hospital for - difficulty breathing, heart rate of 150 at rest, faint and weak and heaty palpitations that have very strong heart pumps, nausea etc. Should i go checked out?"
Recovery,"Tempted to recover  My bf is visiting me for a while... and I noticed that around him it's so much easier to eat, I've been eating healthy amounts of food for a week now, and I just... don't care, he comforts and loves me so much eating is easier and less distressing.

I've been feeling very well too, he said I look less pale and don't have giant bags under my eyes. I feel more alert and present.

I'm so incredibly tempted to recover, but I'm fucking terrified of a life without ana, its been a part of my life for 6 months, its my way to cope, to live, have a goal...

I'm scared ill stop losing weight in recovery

But i want to be healthy, I want to be well, I want to eat with joy like I have for a week...

Disordered,"Trying to decide if I want to feign a migraine to avoid going out either tonight or tomorrow and I hate this  We are going out to a Mexican restaurant tonight for our friend’s birthday and going out to a family outing tomorrow and I’m just so overwhelmed because I hate that social gatherings ALWAYS revolve around food and of course it’s never any of my safe foods. It’s exhausting enough to psych myself up for just one event, but I really don’t want to do both. Preferably none, though. I’ve pretty much been dealing with feeling constantly irritable lately due to restriction and I’m afraid I will just dampen the mood and I can’t drink tonight while everyone else will be because alcohol is a huge trigger for me. :( Restriction makes me such a damn lightweight and as soon as I feel buzzed, I want to eat *everything*. I want to stay at home with my dog and eat my safe foods completely alone.

Disordered,"Eating time at inpatient wards  Hi everyone,

I'm curious to learn about how nursing staff facilitate a meal at an inpatient facility. What happens during meal time?

Disordered,"Is it impossible to still lose weight?  I've been struggling with anorexia for more than three years and I've also been inpatient several times before.
Soon I have to go again which makes me struggle to eat even more. Important to say is that I am not in recovery right now so please don't try to talk sense into me, I already know how damaging it is.

I'm not gonna mention a number but I'm eating very very little but lately I haven't really been losing weight. I am also 100% sure that I'm not tracking my calories wrong or anything, at most I eat less than I actually count.
I know the metabolism slows down and adapts but I don't believe I burn that little by now.
My conclusion would be that my body just won't allow me to go lower than my weight right now(I'm underweight but there are still people way skinnier than me so I know it's possible to go lower)
Which just doesn't make sense to me why I just don't lose any weight :/"
Disordered,"My bf is the only reason I suffer  he called me fat 2 years ago (I wasn’t even “fat” at all) and I ended up losing quite a bit of weight in a very short period of time bcos of that. everybody around in my life says I look so skinny and little. my poor mom is so concerned about why I hardly eat. everybody, except him. when I brought up me being officially underweight and I asked him if he thought I was skinny, he said “to most people you are, but to me your slim thick”  I immediately got sick to my stomach and felt disgusting. because I know that’s not his type, he prefers really little and young looking girls. he prefers flat chest and no curves. I still have curves despite my weight loss and it’s the only thing stopping him from seeing me as the rest of the world sees me. the male validation I receive from the rest of the world doesn’t compare to being not good enough or skinny enough for my bf. I’m so sick of this. i told him I planned on losing even more weight and he acted like he didn’t even care…"

Is this normal??
Disordered,Cant get myself to talk about it  I don’t know if it’s just me but I tried to talk about my ed to my parents multiple times but it’s either I couldn’t get the courage to do so or when I did get the courage and started to explain what is exactly happening I would automatically get shut down and told that I just need to get over it and eat or I just need to get myself together so now I can’t even get myself to talk about it to anyone because I am to afraid to not have my feelings  validated and not being understood (I explained it to one of my closest friends and she said that it’s fine it’s not that bad ) I mean yes there are worse thing happening in the world but I just felt that I wasn’t being right by feeling that way and I am really really really struggling with this

Disordered,"i don’t like my doctor  i really don’t like the way my doctor is treating me but i don’t know if i’m just being dramatic? The hospital i go to partners a lot with the nearby college to give the students there experience. At my first appointment, i just talked to the doctor and she gave me a long laundry list of things to do, stop throwing up, eat three meals a day, up your medication, etc. all to do in a month. i went to my 2nd appointment last night having accomplished two of the things i listed out of the 12 she gave me on the list, stop throwing up and up my medication. Two students came and talked to me first. i really liked the way they approached it because they basically said “even tho you haven’t made a ton of progress, we’re really proud of the progress you have made.” and that made me feel a lot better about it. However when the doctor came in she basically said “i want to stick you in the hospital cause you still haven’t done the entire list. She talked to parents privately and they said i’ll have another appointment in 2 weeks and if i haven’t started eating 3 meals a day i have to go to the hospital for at least a week maybe a month. i feel like my doctors being very abrasive and it doesn’t matter what i do that she just wants me to be in the hospital but i don’t know if i’m being dramatic about the entire situation."

I've never posted on here before, or any sub for that matter. So bear with me guys and I apologize profusely for any spelling or gramatical errors, English isn't my native language. 

I've gained weight, it's not really a significantly 'big' amount but it's enough to make my anxiety go through the roof and on top of that I've gotten stuck in a weight plateau and my body won't let me loose the weight I've put on. I don't know what I've done wrong, I always eat strictly kcal deficently. 
I feel like complete shit because of the weight I've put on, I feel like I've failed and the urge to compensate for it by restricting even more... is overwhelming really.The logical thinking part of my brain knows it's probably water weight but the eating disordered part is literally SCREAMING that I've eaten too much. I'm at loss guys.. I don't know what to do anymore."
Disordered,"It’s bad again TW  I haven’t eaten in a scary amount of time. Before that it was still bad, but not as bad. I feel awful, I can’t focus on work or anything.

I'll just all of a sudden realize that I've lost a bunch of weight again when I go to the doctor or have clothes no longer fit. And then it hits me and I realize that I've been restricting more and more. And by the time I realize this, I'm already so far gone that I end up indulging in it because I tell myself that it's easier.

Recovery,"Do you count other drinks in in your water intake?  Okay so many people suffering from anorexia are drinking A LOT. So usually I tried to drink as less as possible so there would be no weight gain on the scale even if it just was water weight. Anyway recently I started drinking more.

Disordered,"In recovery and really struggling at my highest weight  Hey guys,

So I have been trying to recover from my ED for about three years now with no luck because I cannot afford therapy or the kind of program you usually go to for this sort of thing. In the last year or so I decided I'm tired of living this way and to just go ahead and eat and ditch the exercise. This was really difficult for me because I was an athletics coach and personal trainer for years, so cutting out exercise was a huge lifestyle change for me. I started going to the gym and have been maintaining my weight for a month and a half now.

Recently went to visit my family and they made comments about my weight gain since I am slightly overweight (not really though. It depends on what chart you look at). Everyone else in my family is skinny and I think my mom has an eating disorder also. I explained to them what happened and they eased up but I know they all think I'm fat and probably talk about it when I'm not there. I usually feel really confident these days, which has been awesome. I never felt so confident and happy with myself when I was restricting. The only problem is someone took a picture of a yoga class I taught this morning and I look really fat!!!!!!!

I was so proud of myself and all the work I had been doing to get my life together up until this point. I'm so upset and ashamed that I got so upset over one picture (which doesn't even look that bad and tbh I'm proud of how jacked I am after only a month in the gym). I feel like I've always been so self conscious of my appearance and always think that I look horrible but at least when I was restricting I didn't have to worry about looking fat in photos! I wish I could just have both a skinny body and the kind of life that comes when you actually eat well.

I feel so stupid. After almost a year of working on undoing my bad eating habits and building myself up and feeling good I keep having these upsets where I see myself and I'm kind of big and I just lose it. I know my family thinks I'm ugly and I fucking deserve it for being so sick in the first place. Why can't I just look good again?!?!?!?!

I NEVER want to go back to restricting and all of the horrible habits I had gotten into which almost killed me many times. I'm just angry because I know I'll never be skinny like that again because it is NOT HEALTHY and NOT conducive to the kind of active lifestyle I want to live. I know for a fact though that people will always see pictures of me when I was skinny and make those lame comments like ""wow you were so beautiful when you were younger"" as if I wasn't fucking dying at the time. I looked through old photo albums and you can see me get skinnier and skinnier with every passing year. It's depressing! I'm just terrified now. I want to look good the way I did when I was skinny, but I know what's best for me is to maintain a healthy lifestyle and self-confidence (my increased confidence definitely came from my weight gain because random men finally left me the fuck alone so I could think and speak for myself). Living this way has changed my life so much in the past few months for the better, I never want to restrict again.

I just want to look good."
Recovery,"In your healing journey, did you get rid of social media? Did it help?  
As someone who is very introverted and neurodiverse, I was pretty active on social media and would post often/comment and engage with others often, but as we all know, social media is loaded with triggers. I also would post pictures of food often and stats from my runs, which is of course no good. I got off social media about a week ago now and I’m struggling because I was used to the routine of checking for updates and seeing what people were up to, and I feel kind of lonely and even more in my head now than I was before. 

But I also do feel sort of peaceful and it’s nice not having to deal with constantly being triggered by weight loss posts, other people’s running/exercise stats, posts normalizing disordered eating, pictures of conventionally attractive thin/fit people, people posting about how great life is while mine is a literal burning dumpster fire, etc. I feel like I should just push through and continue my hiatus. I’m trying to make small steps that will hopefully help improve my current state and move me along the path to recovery."

The guilt will eventually pass.You will most likely love your body more once you are at the weight you were created to be in having nourished your bodys signals.You do not need to be skinny to be loved.Putting of recovery if you are considering it is just dragging you deeper it will never be enough and even if it is at some point you would regret loosing all this time of your life and it will just be hareder thats all.Life is worth living and anorexia is taking it away.You arent a pig you arent eating too much.Im proud of you.If it doesnt chalenge you,it doesnt change you.If it feels wrong its right.Food is your medicine its okay to overeat once in a while and it is always ok to eat.It will get easier you will never regret revovery the thought of that simply means you arent quite there yet.I hope this helps at least one person.I love you and believe in you"

Disordered,"Being unemployed is ruining my progress  I’ve been doing pretty well with my ED for the past couple of years but it’s starting to get bad again. I was laid off in March and have been watching all of my former colleagues get hired at great companies meanwhile I keep getting rejections for jobs I know I’d be great at. Every rejection feels like a punch to the gut and I completely lose my appetite. Then I have to do additional interviews where I’m starving, depressed, anxious, and my brain can’t function fully to perform well. 

I’ve been forcing down food every evening because I know I need it to function, but the nausea is bad and I can feel myself slipping back into how I felt when things have spiraled before. 

I don’t want this. I have additional mental health issues as well and I feel like I’m at such a disadvantage to land a good job. 

There’s also the money aspect where I feel like I’m going to run out of funds if I go grocery shopping or order food.

Over the months we’ve been dating I’ve been gaining a lot of weight and I feel so disgusting. I wanna go back to restricting but I know he’ll catch on"
Disordered,"i think i have an ED and idk if i want to recover  I’ve never dealt with an ED until I think I developed (undiagnosed) anorexia a few months ago and it’s been so scary. 

I’ve been very knowledgeable about EDs my whole life (many people around me have had them and I have done a lot of research) and so I knew exactly what was going on the moment it started, which makes me feel so ashamed because I didn’t try to stop it. I initially didn’t even want to lose weight but I started restricting my food intake because it felt good for some reason (control, gender dysphoria, body image issues, self harm behavior? idk). I have since lost weight and restrict even more now. Eating makes me so anxious now and I avoid a lot of foods. I barely recognize my behavior compared to a few months ago. I even bought a scale and have done c/s which makes me feel so ashamed. But now I want to lose more weight and I’m so scared of eating normally and going back to my previous weight. 

The logical part of my brain is saying that this is clearly ED behavior and I should try to recover before it gets worse. It feels like it would be so easy to stop. The other part of my brain is saying I’m not sick enough to recover. It’s only been a few months and I’m not even underweight, so how am I supposed to recover from nothing? I want to lose more weight, I like the feeling of my jeans being looser now. I feel like I’m going crazy I can’t stop thinking about food and my body. I feel so ashamed for knowingly giving myself an ED, but suddenly I don’t feel like I have control over it anymore. Why did I go out of my way to buy a scale and feel happy about it? 

I’m also non-binary and want to get a breast reduction next year. I’m terrified of getting it and then gaining weight and my chest getting bigger again. I don’t even know what I would do I’m so scared. 

Anyways I’m in therapy and on antidepressants. I feel so embarrassed to be going to to therapy every week and not changing my behavior at all. I just don’t know if I want to change. I don’t really want to stop but I know I should.

I have been home for a few weeks now and have stayed the same weight but I always feel like I need to control myself because I have such a strong appetite still. 
i know extreme hunger is common in recovery, but is it still comon when I’m weigh restored? I also still feel cold, lightheaded and dizzy all the time. I had a blood test but that came back fine. I thought I would be less hungry when I’m weight restored but I think it only got worse. I don’t know if it really is hunger or just appetite.

A few weeks ago I decided that I’d just sneak one in my bag. I left the store and immediately felt horrible and told myself it would be the last time. That was a lie because I have not paid for laxatives since. I don’t shoplift anything else. But I feel absolutely horrible, yet in the store the ED part of my brain tells me it’s okay and it’s worth the risk to steal something that causes me so much pain, rather then to lose 20 bucks and pay for it.

I've gotten to the point where if I eat a handful of food, I will get full and lose my appetite.

If I eat a normal sized meal, I'll be uncomfortably full ALL DAY and the next day I will still feel like I have it in my stomach. So now I dread eating even more than I did.

I want to try to start eating more regularly so I can get more nutrients from food and stop turning down friends/family for social meals outside of my usual eating time for fear of physical discomfort, but I don't know how to begin. Is there a way to ""expand"" the volume my stomach can take in? Will I just have to start eating more and fight through the uncomfortableness? I've tried looking but can't seem to find this issue being discussed anywhere."
Disordered,I hate relapsing  This sucks a lot. I relapse out of laziness and inconvenience. I relapsed last week without realizing it (ugh!!!!) and now I’m at my lowest weight. I was finally starting to make progress but now I have to work twice as hard. I haven’t eaten today (it’s 8pm) and I’m too exhausted to even think about what I’m going to eat let alone prepare it. I wanna take a nap and try to eat after i wake up but I know I’m still going to feel tired because I haven’t eaten anything and I’ll just end up laying in bed. I hate this stupid disease so much. I wish I could wake up and be recovered.
Disordered,"TIFU by giving myself tonsillitis  It was around 8pm yesterday when i was so cold all of a sudden that my whole body was purple, this is in the uk and we are currently going through a heat wave, so i was like what why am i shivering cold. i was so cold i was crying and holding my fluffy dog for warmth. In the morning i couldn’t move, drink or eat and my mother had called the ambulance.
Turns out i have tonsillitis because of my eating disorder."
Disordered,How long did it take you to realize you had anorexia?  
Disordered,"I think I've gotten worse  Reading a post on here, I saw someone mentioning an app for intermittent fasting. I didn't even know those were a thing, but I decided to use it on top of my normal restriction. I usually scatter my low calorie snacks through the day but now I only do it within the eating period the app sets. I went for my usual walk today and I felt weaker than I've ever felt. It was such a strong palpable thing, how much I just wanted to lay on the ground and not even move again. I think I just entered a new low."
Disordered,"Don't make fun of people's eating habits  I heard my parents talking about one of my eating habits this morning and I'm feeling like I just don't want to eat ever again. 

I have pretty intense stomach issues unfortunately, and that greatly restricts what foods I can and can't eat. Recently, I've been eating a lot of sandwiches because it's good protein (which I've been told I need more of) and they don't bother my stomach. This morning after I woke up, though, I heard my parents saying about how ""I ate two bags of chips in two days"". I usually eat some chips with my sandwich, but not that much. I know that I've been eating more chips, but that's only because I eat sandwiches more often and I like them together. 

I just feel really sad because that was one of my only safe foods and now I know they make fun of me. I didn't think anyone in my family would because they know how bad my stomach is and know how I can't ear certain foods. I've also had a really decreases appetite due to my stomach issues, so I don't know why they're making fun of me eating at all. Yesterday was the first day in a while that I ate three proper meals and I was really proud of myself, but now I just feel like I'm eating too much :/

Sorry for the venting, but I just need some support."

I know it’s gonna be over my daily intake but I wanna just go for it before I change my mind and regret it? It’s just one day so I’ll be fine right?

We don’t know if we’ll get it but I can’t do this alone

We weren’t close enough to be true friends but we’re on our way there, she’s good ppl, if a little young for me to truly connect with.I wouldn’t say that she was overweight(weighs less than me, lol) but wasn’t a skinny mini like some girls at the barn. 
Just over a yr ago we both moved barns and since then I’ve only kept in touch via FB. Also since then she has become a rep for a wellness brand selling products for chariots things including weight loss, stress relief, energy, etc. It’s a fancy MLM/pyramid scheme. She seems happy in the pics and I’ve followed her business page to support her. 
Unfortunately in most of her fb posts she recently has begun to look downright unhealthy. Like anorexic unhealthy. At first I thought she was just loosing weight, that’s fine, I’m trying to loose lbs too, and it supports her products.  But now she looks a bit sickly. 
Is there a good way to ask if she’s ok? Online as that’s our only contact point? Or should I just but out and mind my own business. 

Little bit more info… among the group of ppl we have in common she didn’t really fit in… she has a bit of a teenager attitude despite being mid/late 20’s."

hey everyone! avid reader in recovery and so glad to have you all for support. i actively try not to count calories, but it is difficult because i know most of the calorie counts of foods that i eat regularly as “safe foods.” i noticed i don’t know the calories of many alcohols or carbs because i didn’t consume them before recovery. anyone else have this epitome about a food?

Ive been saying my ed has been going for a year for about a year haha but I forgot that before the ed there is disordered eating and am now finding out 3 years of my life had passed ik thats not a lot compared to many of yall but its just quite shocking.The way I realised it was by hearing my friend from more than 3 years saying she has never seen me eat normally and she cant imagine it even like me just eating like a person which is quite sad but yeah just stopping by to remind you that our lives are passing by and if you are considering recovery you should go for it now

I kinda got the feeling All i get is fat on my body, even when i eat healthy and doing spirt in my recovery.
My knees; thighs and my stomach storing fat while other people r thinner at the point. 
I only got ""thin"" when i restrict for 2-3 days. Somebody else got the Problem?
I also gain really Quick weight; my weight kinda doubles in a week and i just eat one meal per day bc i cant get more.
Is this normal? Is this just water and food weight ?
Bc i dont know anymore. I am trying since months and it doesnt seem to get better."
Recovery,"binge effects  last night i binged. i’ve been on high restriction all week, so afterwards i started to feel bad (terrible head and stomach aches, dizziness)

Disordered,"relapse  i tried to recover. i thought i recovered, i started eating again, going to restaurants, eating MEAT! i didn't exercise i used to just restrict a lot and with the increase in calories motivation came back to work out, swim, read, i finally fell like i was part of the world and not lost in my rotten brain and its obsessive thoughts. but i feel like i'm relapsing, i know full well what's in store for me, i know i'm gonna lose strength and interest for everything, i know that but i feel powerless??? what is it about anorexia that's so """"""""""appealing"""""" even when you spend your days lying in bed starving exhausted and sad?"
Disordered,"I don’t think some people understand that I’m not losing weight to appeal to girls  I can tell that girls prefer healthy guys than unhealthy guys. Muscular, fit, average build are all preferable than a weak skinny underweight guy, or at least that’s what I think. I’m not losing weight so girls would like me, this whole dieting mess is spiraling out of control. When my belly hurts due to hunger, I take off my shirt to press it, I drink hot coffee or tea, I chew gum, I exercise.

I call the suicidal hotline and another email service, they don’t take me seriously. Two girls told me being skinny doesn’t look good on a guy. I know their intentions are kind, but I don’t think they understand. I have bipolar, and I see a psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist regularly. I’m terrified to tell them what’s going on.

Disordered,"spiraling a little bit  i low key think im on the verge of a relapse. the last couple of weeks have been pretty hard- my apple watch broke and i low key realized that even though i tend to consider myself as “recovered,” i’m kind of dependent on that stupid watch to track how much calories i’ve burned. and i check it all day everyday. not being able to track my calorie kind of forced me to confront the fact that i kind of use that number as validation for allowing myself to eat as much as i want?? like i’ve noticed that on days where i feel like i’ve eaten a lot, i’d open my phone and check how many calories i’d burned that day and if it was a high number then i wouldn’t feel so bad about eating a lot. 
but anyway, my watch broke and i couldn’t track my calorie burning and i started to feel really bloated just all the time and it’s been weeks and i still feel disgustingly bloated. but also i haven’t shit in like 3 days (gross, sorry) so maybe that’s why? at this point i took like half a laxative, which felt like a tiny failure/relapse even though it’s kind of a normal thing to do since it’s been so many days??
i redownloaded my fasting app too, though, which is the thing that really worries me because that was the main thing that fueled my eating disorder when it was at its worse. i’ve been trying so hard to recover and that singular action feels like it really set me back. i just don’t know what to do at this point though because i’m so insanely bloated, to the point where i don’t even feel like myself. i just wanted a little control back so i could feel like myself but i’m also worried that things are going to get bad from here.

In order to make that happens I looked for advices and see lot of people saying that I needed to care not to gain weight too fast and as I've got a BIG brain I did maybe a litle bit too much ...
I lost X kg during the year and developped real annorexia. I'm recovering since a month and doing pretty fucking well I'm able to eat out it at restaurants or Friends' house...

But im being put in an outpatient program for separate reason not bad one’s actually really great ones, they want to get me into a routine and back to some feeling of normality, they think im doing great, I feel like my stomach sinks when I even try and think about my “relapse” I know what im doing deep down, I know the thoughts, during evaluation they weigh you and the whole two week program they need to check the marks for every meal time and you have to have everything if you refuse it could make them dig into me and got It just it makes me sick thinking about it, I have no one to talk to this about I don’t know what to do, im starting to obsess again I have to cover mirrors and the self loathing is unbearable"

Recovery,"Recovered for years but hunger signals are still non existent  I (33f) have struggled with anorexia on and off since I was 13. I would typically have a few years restricting followed by weight restoration and adequate food intake, and ping back and forth. I finally stayed recovered for the past 3 years, and I do want it to stick this time.

While I’m at a healthy weight, getting a regular period, and eating enough, I still have almost no appetite. I’ve tried so many strategies in terms of meal frequency and macronutrient ratios, but nothing helps. Now I’m stuck in a place where if I don’t wait until very late in the day, I will get sick if I eat more than a small amount, or some of my food will involuntarily come back up. I have been to a Dr and they found nothing wrong with me except elevated liver enzymes which is odd because I hardly drink and don’t eat sugar. 

I also don’t feel like I have made much progress mentally. I still dislike my body 3 years in. I don’t try in clothes in stores or with friends bc I will likely start crying, and while I don’t restrict food I still feel terrible and gross for every bite I take but I don’t want to keep damaging my health so I continue eating enough to maintain my weight. I’m at a healthy (not low or high BMI) size, and I’ve been stable for years. I feel totally hopeless. My relationship with food and body image is essentially unchanged and it’s like I’ve got the worst of both worlds (the negative mental aspects of an eating disorder but without the skinny part).

Recovery,"Nervous about seeing a doctor about my ED  I \[21M\] started seeing a therapist for the first time!! I briefly admitted to struggling w/ an ED, which was really hard for me. I feel like I'm fine, but she's been recommending I see a doctor and getting labs done and stuff while we address my mental health. 

I know she wants me to do it so we both know if I have any ED-related health issues going on, but the idea of seeing a doctor *really* makes me nervous - just thinking about it is making my brain spin into bad ED habits. All the food-related or numbers-related questions they'd ask, and the whole ""I don't feel sick enough to get help"" thing... urg. 

I'm just scared, and everything is happening really fast. It was half the battle to admit to any sort of professional that I struggle w/ food in the first place, idk if I can sit in front of a literal doctor and say that again.

Disordered,"Need advice for friend/roommate with anorexia  Hi, throwaway and really hoping she doesn’t use Reddit let alone this thread.

I’m hoping to get some advice or be pointed in the right direction to get advice. 

One of my close friends/roommates (f22) has anorexia and has made a promise to me and her therapist to attempt recovery, and she requested she do it from home so she can keep working remotely. (Important info: Her parents are not involved in her life). I had one session with both my friend and her team who talked to both of us about accountability and what that looks like for my friend. I’m more than happy to take on this role and keep my friend accountable, I love her and care about her and her recovery is important to me. 

However, she clearly does not want to be held accountable. She does not have an option to move out due to finances… which is probably for the best. I am not forcing her to do anything, per therapist instructions. I simply point out when she is lying about food/exercise and remind her when she forgets about meals/snacks. But recently she’s told me that she doesn’t need a parent and she doesn’t need to be policed. I told her it’s obviously not my intention, but I’m trying to keep her from ending up in the hospital and she knows that I have to tell her team the truth if she is not making an effort. I don’t want to, and I hate that it’s an ultimatum I just want to see more effort on her end. We set up boundaries in therapy before starting this accountability thing. 

She is independent in almost every other aspect, so I don’t feel like I have to do everything for her. Outside of this we have an incredible relationship and I do view her as a sister. Any other tips on how I can stop coming off as overbearing? Anything else I can do to support? I am a little nervous she agreed to this with no intentions of following through to avoid going to treatment."

Recovery,"It can get better. I promise.  All through High School, I had a pretty severe ED (I struggled mainly with anorexia). My parents fueled a lot of it, and I developed a super unhealthy relationship with exercise (I was running varsity cross country). Although I loved running, my ED slowly degraded my relationship with the sport. I continued engaging with my ED in college, and was running for my collegiate cross country team before my body gave up.  I was medically pulled from all exercise by both my athletic trainer and my team physician (I couldn't even go for walks alone). I didn't want to recover, but once I lost the privilege to exercise, I did miss running.

Three months after getting medically pulled (and after multiple recovery-relapse episodes) I finally decided that really putting effort into recovering could be worth it. This journey has been so hard, and I still have my fair share of bad days, but it has been SO worth it. I just started running again, and I am injury and exhaustion free for the first time in months! Recovery has been so hard and scary, but I am much healthier physically, mentally, and emotionally since I started. I know that it's easier said than done, and no recovery process is linear, but it really can and does get better. Virtual hugs to everyone that needs them today <3"

I wont go into too much detail but I have lost weight. But I didn’t see it as a problem even now. But now my family is starting to question me. and now this is the main reason I’m reevaluating everything. I’m starting to experience other symptoms i guess. My brain has just been in a fog this last month, and I’ve been getting dizzy/faint daily now. (There is other things but I don’t want to share too much) The thought that maybe this isn’t as in control as i thought is terrifying. 
My life now is way better now though than it was during that time, I have a amazing bf and I job I absolutely love, and I have good friends. I have a lot to lose I guess. And I’m thinking that maybe I do need to seek treatment. But I’m scared of gaining weight and stupidly I have this fear that my bf may leave me, if I gain weight/seek treatment. Maybe that everyone will finally see how much of a burden I am, and just be done with me. But I also am not really experiencing ED thoughts and I don’t want to be sick. So maybe I’m just overthinking and just worried about nothing and I’m just fine. But it did feel nice to finally get this off my chest."

Recovery,"problems with hair dye because of anorexia?  Hi I’ve been in recovery for almost 2 years and Im healthier than ever :) 
I do still experience some slight hair loss then and there but it’s pretty alright.

Disordered,"getting kicked out out of therapy  tw ed (no numbers)

i don‘t know what to do. I‘m currently in treatment for my bpd, previously I lost a lot of weight during my stay in the psych ward.
On the first day I got weighed & I gained weight which kinda made me freak out.
But I worked against it & continued to eat. 
They did tell me that I‘m gonna get kicked out if my bmi gets under a certain number.
Which is really close to the number on the scale.
The thing is that the day before I ate a lot, but didn‘t visit the restroom & was kinda constipated for around a week
Additionally I wore heavy clothes & wearing shoes. They barely reduced the number bc of the clothing 
I‘m a really shy person so I was too scared to say anything & also kinda dissociating so I could barely stay conscious

So I know that the number is higher than my actual weight.
The problem is that I have to step on the scale sporadically so I can’t even wear the right clothes for that day.

So it‘s been two weeks & I don‘t know if I should say anything but I‘m pretty sure I‘m below the number. 
I kinda restricted on the weekend but not before. 
I drank a lot of matcha & now everything‘s out.
I feel a lot lighter which feels great but also I‘m kinda freaking out

It‘s pretty warm so I can‘t wear the clothes I wore that day. 
I‘m scared that if I tell them they make me step on the scale & then kick me out

I know that I should just gain weight but I‘m honestly not ready & there‘s a lot of other stuff I need to work on

EDIT thanks for the support but well now i fucked up on my own by booking a flight to mallorca that I can‘t cancel"
Disordered,"is your sternum/breastbone cracking when you stretch your chest?  lol i don't know if it is anorexia related but i've only experienced that since i started suffering from my ed. everyday without any exception, my sternum has to be popped, often more than once during the day. weirdly enough, it feels very good & satisfactory even though there's a tiny little pain to the touch around the area therafter. let me know about you!"
Disordered,"so much pressure  i’ve been doing really really badly again for the past few months, and trying to get out of the downward spiral, but it’s so painful and difficult. i have a great therapist who has helped a bit, & i’ve been honest with her & trying so hard to recover and get back out of this. for now, i’m living back home after graduating from college, & my parents put so much shame, guilt, and pressure on me in recovery. my dad calls me manipulative, my mom goes on and on about how she’s tired of this and having to deal w me like this. they’ve both said i make others around me miserable and feel helpless with this. i feel like i do better taking small steps feeling comfortable with eating when i do it on my own, and progress isn’t linear, but they’re trying to impose a high intensity plan on me now. tonight, things escalated to a huge fight when i was having a hard time eating, and these fights and the yelling just make the ed voice louder too. i can’t truly recover when i’m being forced into it like this, but they say they can’t just watch me get worse— i understand this,  but i don’t see a middle ground here— I HAVE BEEN TRYING. i also have bpd, and i’m dealing with a long distance relationship with my bf who is also my fp. in the fight, they were threatening to text him or call him about how bad i’m doing, even though he already knows i’m not doing great right now. they kept repeating that he’s not going to put up with me for long and the intense fear of him leaving me takes over and i can’t think or breathe and it gets even harder to eat when they involve that fear. i don’t know what to do. they keep calling me manipulative for explaining different things they do that trigger me and for crying a lot around things related to food. i’m not trying to be manipulative i can’t control the intense anxiety and pain i feel around eating and the accusations just make it so much harder. i don’t know what to do to get them to trust that i’m trying to get better and not put so much intensity around these situations that are already intense from the ed voice. they think i’m making excuses or something but i’m really trying, i just need my own time and space for this. it’s so painful and scary and difficult. the forced intensity is not going to be sustainable for me. how can i express this to them without things blowing up again?"
Disordered,pooping?  So I've been restricting to about * calories a day for a month now and I noticed I poop a lot less now. I'm worried right now because this is the longest I've been without pooping now (** days) I took a laxative but that didn't really help. I'm afraid to force anything because I've heard scary stories where people's innards became outtards if you catch my drift.
Disordered,"I don't know what to think about this..  (Trigger warning: this post contains talk about weight, no numbers are mentioned, body image, mentions of behaviors such as calories counting, purging, excessive exercising, binging. Stay safe!)

Hi! I'm Lillith, just to put down some context, I'm a minor, undiagnosed, and while I can't officially say that I have an ED, it's pretty obvious that I do. My ED kinda consists of what I call ""phases"" I have a phase where I'm full on counting calories, skipping meals, liquid cals at best, smoking to cut hunger, drinking a lot, exercising. Then the other is binging. It doesn't stsy long (a week or so) and doesn't happen often, it's triggered when I don't get food I'm body for a long time and start watching mukbangs and stuff about food, I then feel guilty and gross and go back to the other phase. Sometimes when I have no choice I eat like a ""normal person"" but try to burn it off by exercising (I do at home biking and sometimes sit-ups). What triggers me, weirdly, are compliments. I had gained a lot during the summer bc I did nothing but stay in my room and would snake a lot, I shed the pounds naturally when I got back to school because I would have sports classes, would walk around the school everyday and couldn't snake at school. (TW: Numbers/talk about my weight) So I went from **kg for 164cm in August, to **kg for 165cm in November. Then I started getting a lot of compliments from a lil group of younger girls at my school (my friends called them my fangirls) they would say I was pretty and all, then sometimes they would hug me and say, wow you're so thin! That's so cool! 
I crave compliments, affection, I want to keep it forever, I have a past with bullying and parents I disappointed cuz I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until 8th grade (so really). I would rarely get compliments, so now I do everything to keep them. While I was someone who didn't want to care about they way I looked because I knew I was too mentally unstable for it lol, this triggered something in me. My mom also made comments me she saw me eating snack ""be careful you're going to end up like this summer""
I slowly started to get obsessed with my weight, and a goal of **g made its way into my head. So here was the starting point of my ED. Now I'm kinda deep into it but it's summer break so skipping meals is hard, I try to exercise, I skipped meals when my parents worked, now they don't so I can't. But I also got into the binging phase until 2 days ago. 
Here's the thing, I don't like throwing up, but that didn't stop me from trying to make myself purge, I've never been able to though. Until today, I was trying to purge but couldn't, I went on internet, searched ""how to make yourself puke"" found something, tried it once, succeeded. I did about three times until I just couldn't bc I still don't like to throw up. I exercised a lot today, purged, and skipped to meals, and drank a lot of water. I felt the dizziness I feel when ""it's working"" I'm used to it and it's strangely satisfying since I associate it with weight loss. The purging too, while I still don't like to puke, I had this feeling of satisfaction. 

Now, I don't know what to think about this... did I just achieved a new, dangerous, step into my ED? Or is it just me being dramatic about it, and I probably won't pick up on this behavior? Searching for some advice :) 
I hope what I said was clear,

Have a nice day/night!"

How can I help and be there for a fairly young family member who does not want help, does not want to recover, does not want to talk to a professional, is very deep into their ed and a part of anti-recovery pro-ana communities on the internet?

Disordered,"I keep forgetting to eat vegetables  I was wondering why I wasn't feeling well, then realized I forgot to eat fruit or vegetables in an entire week. 🤦‍♂️"
Disordered,"vent. my ed ruined my relationship  yeah, title. i met her at the lowest point in my life as an insecure teenager, and thanks to her i learnt to love myself and my life. we spent 3.5 years together and she was the most incredible person i've ever met. everything i always thought someone like me didn't deserve, but for some reason she saw something in me. she knew i'd had a few eds in the past, but i was fine for most of our relationship.

earlier this year i relapsed because of a conversation i had with a friend. I fell into it kinda hard, especially cause summer was coming up. and as you know eds take away from every other aspect of your life. i was naive and thought that our love for each other would somehow make us immune to this. but as the months went by i was isolating even from her, being distracted with my own appearance, ignoring her texts cause logging my intake was somehow more important, we had sex less and less often cause of my insecurities when she'd never said anything negative about my appearance. 

so about 2 months ago she just told me we'd grown apart and the person i'd become wasn't who she needed anymore. she me her outright mentioned an eating disorder, but that's pretty much what it was. i spent the whole night crying but i couldn't even be mad at her. she needed someone who can pay attention to her and maintain a relationship, i feel like being anorexic made me too selfish for her. part of me wishes she'd done something wrong, but she didn't, so my only choice is to see myself as the villain. i know it's possible for neither of us to be the bad guy, my brain knows that but my heart doesn't feel that way. 

i blame myself for it. a lot. especially knowing she would love me no matter what my weight was, and i fucked everything up by caring about just that


im not happy with myself. i know i didn't choose to have anorexia but it feels like if i just tried harder to  recover, she would still be with me. i keep replaying moments where i was preoccupied with myself and i could have done something for her instead. i really regret that i didnt tell her things got bad again, i knew for a fact she'd support me, but i also knew she'd be worried and try and stop me from getting worse. so i just kept it to myself and now she thinks i don't prioritize her anymore. and it's too late to tell her now cause it would just feel like i'm guilting her into getting back with me again, and it's over anyways, she made her decision and i can't change it now. 

i've never felt so stupid in my life. we met when we were both 15, now we're 19 and 20. the girl who i practically grew up with, was planning on marrying, consider the love of my life, gone all cause of a fucking eating disorder. it's been a wake up call, but i still can't bring myself to recover. i'm not even emotionally stable enough to try. i have no idea what to do with myself again

just so no one worries too much, i have plenty other people who are there for me and thank god for that, i have no intentions of hurting myself either. just very, very heartbroken is all. i don't know where else to vent cause i still don't want anyone worrying, but i needed this off my chest. thanks for reading"
Disordered,"[TW] is it just me or is this pretty normal  I’ve been recovering for about a month right now and I’ve realized I was way happier back when I was eating 1 small meal a day now my diet is full of food and I just feel heavy and disgusting in my own body I feel way tired and I just have no motivation at all and before when I was limiting my food I was so outgoing and bright. I feel like I want to go back to it so bad but I know it’s not good for me or my health, and right now im scared to step on the scale and check my weight, help"
Disordered,"Trying to recover, but life  I live in poverty, and where I live food is so expensive. Honestly, I can’t even see a point in trying to recover anymore. A lot of people don’t understand the heartbreaking feeling of trying to recover, opening your empty fridge and saying “haha, well this is great for my ED at least”. One of the reasons my ED is so bad in the first place is because I have always lived in poverty. Growing up often homeless with a single parent on welfare who spent her money on crack instead of food for her children, well, I’m used to living like this. I tried to change and get help now that I am an adult, I am trying to recover, but how do you recover when you can’t afford the thing that is meant to heal your body? I’d say I just want to give up, but I don’t even have the luxury of giving up because there isn’t anything there. Basically I’m just accepting defeat, accepting the darkness, living in the way I’m apparently meant to. Soon I won’t even have internet because I haven’t been able to pay it in months. So darkness it is, I guess.

Disordered,"Extreme hunger after weight restoration  
So, I was discharged in February- I’m weight restored and have been at a steady weight for a few months 

However - I have started training again (lifting) and I have been restricting slightly… 

Could this trigger feelings of extreme hunger again? As if my body is panicking? Or if I’ve not got energy from restricting and it needs more to boost itself?

Disordered,just jokes  Been asked how much weight i plan on losing since i am so small already. So i answer i plan on seeing the scale display the number 0. And i laughed. And they laughed. And we all laughed.
Disordered,"Diagnosed with anorexia nervosa but after looking into it im not sure?  i’ll try to keep this short but i’ve struggled with generalized anxiety disorder since i was a kid and being too anxious to eat on and off for a few years now that i can remember. i know i’ve always had trouble gaining weight though. about three years ago i got a shot for birth control and it made me gain quite a bit in a year, after previously struggling to get above the underweight mark. but now after some things changed in my life and was in a high stress living situation, my inability to eat returned. i became severely depressed and don’t remember how long i wasn’t eating for as all my days were heavily blended together but i know it was several months. my weight dropped down a huge amount and i almost had to be hospitalized about half a year ago. i got a doctor to help and explained that it wasn’t a conscious decision or image based, i just get nauseous sometimes and physically cannot eat for long periods of time. i got the diagnosis and started medication that was supposed to help and never thought about it again. it took a few months to get my appetite back and slowly start gaining weight again but sometimes if i forget to eat for a day it’ll come back, and i’ll be too nauseous to eat for days from that point. and just have to wait until i feel like i can eat. i’m in one of those situations now and upset with myself because i want to eat but physically feel like i cant, and don’t want to lose any progress i’ve made with gaining weight back recently (which is what usually happens) . but i looked the diagnosis up and almost everywhere it says that it’s a self image thing and almost a conscious decision because you don’t want to go above your desired weight. which has never been me. so i was just wondering can it be both or was i maybe misdiagnosed? i also hope none of this came across as rude or insensitive! just genuinely trying to figure out more about my eating issues"
Disordered,Please reassure me  I ate like 20g more yoghurt today than I usually would and I’m panicking that it’s gonna make a huge difference even though rationally I know it won’t. Please can someone reassure me that it’s absolutely fine and nothing worth worrying about?
Disordered,"clothes makes the...?  Back story: I'm 36 and have had an ED, mostly anorexia, for years in the past. I recovered, mostly, despite being discharged with a 'management' plan rather than a relapse prevention plan. I've been more or less healthy for a decade and I basically ate whatever I wanted trying to avoid triggering relapse. 
I've had a higher weight than I could be comfortable with after my second baby, and I was not happy with my 'sugar addiction'. 
Anyhow. A year ago I got sick with something like long covid but not long covid. I burned myself out (because I am still the same idiot who tried to climb mountains with a very low weight and anaemia) by keeping going and basically I've had nausea very often, leading to weight loss, and after getting a really bad bout of depression, basically some profoundly anorexic stuff in my mind. 
And the weight is beginning to match. 


So. The clothes. 
I love clothes, I love making it look good. It's my bit of creative play, and I kind of missed that when I was at my highest weight and during pregnancies because I bought and wore cheaper, poorer fitting clothes with boob access. (For breastfeeding, not other stuff). 
Not too long ago, I invested in basically a big wardrobe upheaval because I figured I was at a weight I could and should maintain as a mother and be healthy with it. I had already tossed the baby-era clothes a while ago.

This weekend I 'had' to basically go through my closet and take out everything that is too big and doesn't really look good if worn 'oversized', it is a lot, and some stuff still have the tags on. I took some of my pre pregnancy clothes off Vinted again (from the time after the discharge with minimal weight restoration), some things even from uni. I fit the jeans I never intended to fit again but just kept because they remind me of adventures. My body has definitely changed.

And I don't know how to feel about it. 

The intention is positive: I want to look put together, I want to be kinder towards myself, I want to actually not draw attention to my weight. I want to not be confronted with clothes that should fit but don't everyday. 

My anorexic mindset enjoys it but fuck her. 

But in the end: isn't this kind of defeat? Or is it acceptance? 
Realistically I know that for now the only attainable goal would be to stop losing weight, but it also feels like defeat and maybe a bit crazy. 

Anyway. That's all. I just needed to say that."
Disordered,"I'm relapsing again and idk what to do  I'm relapsing again and I'm already sad about it. This happens every time. Today was the first day of my relapse and now at midnight I'm thinking ""I should just eat and give up on this"", but then I'm also thinking ""but I hate how my body is and if I ate now, I'd be weak and a bad anorexic"". And then I also feel hungry and so all of that together is just a pile of sadness.

And ALSO my gf has begun to engage in bulimic behaviours (such as self induced vomiting) and is brushing me off when I tell her that it isn't okay, and it will hurt her in a lot of ways in the future. I contemplated breaking up with her because of this, since now we both have eating problems and we will only make each other worse. But I'm also scared of making her sad. 

I'm just so lost on so many levels and I'm just aaaaaaa"
Disordered,"Not eating again  I 19M have never been diagnosed with an ED and I don’t necessarily believe I have one either, however, my eating is very disordered and definitely not healthy. I have always struggled with my self-image, especially my body and weight. Almost a year ago, I started restricting what I ate, skipping meals, and just lost my appetite in general. I started losing weight, I lost so much that everyone around me noticed and often pointed it out. My parents became concerned and consistently asked if I was taking something to lose weight, which I wasn’t. Some of my friends even asked if I was losing weight healthily, alluding to an ED. I even noticed some physical symptoms such as losing body hair, a huge decline in my gum health, easily bruising, etc. One thing that did help me through this time and stopped me from losing more weight than I did is marijuana. It gave me an appetite even when I didn’t want to eat. The past month or two, I have been doing much better and was keeping a consistent weight. However, last week I stopped smoking and I think I would have been fine if I didn’t stop right when I was having a depressive episode but I did and I have not had an appetite in days. I’ve not eaten a full meal in days, all I have been able to eat is a little bit here and there. I’m sure that I’m going to start losing weight again and even though I want to, I know it’s not healthy at all. I also know I’m not going to have an appetite without marijuana but I can’t smoke it right now and don’t know what to do."
Disordered,"I genuinely hate my parents  I have a hard time restricting my food, so I do a lot of intermittent fasting. Since it is Summer, I have been eating my first meal at 11am and my last one at 3pm. My parents dislike this though. My parents always want me to eat dinner with them, but they always make us eat insanely late. They try to make me eat at 8pm-10pm. They know how important not eating late is to me (aside from the weight benefits, it also allows me to fall asleep. I used to not be able to sleep until 3am-4am, but when I do not eat late, I can fall asleep early). They could not care less though. They also always want me to eat a lot of dinner and lecture me if I eat anything aside from breakfast before dinner, leaving me incredibly hungry during the day. They used to make me eat with them every night, but I have managed to get it down to 3 days a week. This makes them very unhappy though and they constantly accuse me of ruining the family."
Disordered,"Relapse sucks ass :/  I was doing well too, and now I’m back at square one. Eating anything makes me feel guilty, and I lie constantly about food and I’m triggered by every little thing and I can’t stop looking in the mirror to body check. And the worst part of it all is nobody knows. This is such a lonely disorder. Like I want people to know but I also don’t because if they find out they’ll be disappointed. And also my eating disorder would be angry with me for telling them what’s going on. I hate the lying to friends and family, I hate how long every day feels, I hate it all. But I can’t seem to stop. Not to mention the constant worry of getting help “too soon” since I’m not “thin enough.” And the fact that my body looks the same to me every day no matter what. This sucks lol. It makes everything so hard. And I was clean for a year. They’re going to be so disappointed in me."

This means I have to atleast pretend that I’m eating more ( even tho what i do is sneak food away). I have to stay with them for 3 weeks which means A HELL lot of food and maybe even going out for meals. I’ll have to eat more than normal portion sizes and I’m really really anxious and panicked. I’m afraid I’m gonna gain a lot of weight, but I cant show that I’m restricting so I’m in a horrible position.

Disordered,"just something i hate  maybe i’m alone on this but the amount of assumptions about eating disorders piss me off. there’s no weight requirement for having an ed, the psychologist isn’t gonna be like “okay so you present all the signs but you don’t weigh under x so ya can’t be diagnosed okay? bye bye now”. not all eating disorders start because of weight, they can (and usually do) turn into being weight related but usually involve something different psychology (i.e. control issues, ocd, etc etc). and lastly, the idea that eating disorders are only serious when you *look* sick. if you don’t, then everyone says “omg tell me how you lost the weight” or “omg how’d you get those curves”. if you look attractive, people don’t care and it’s irritating. 

anyway that’s my little rant on a few assumptions i absolutely hate"
Disordered,"Does anorexia make your boobs disproportionate?

Disordered,"recovery on your own  has anyone gone through an ed and recovery and never told anyone? i feel like that’s were I am right now, and i wanted to know if it’s possible because it seems like it is for me"
Disordered,"I developed anorexia because of my mom  she’d always call me fat no matter how hard i tried ever since i remember she’d call me fat , now that i have lost weight she’s calling me skinny and ugly and that i should gain some weight because no one would ever want me like this even though my weight is perfectly normal right now and i thought i looked good i thought she’d be proud but no apparently now im too skinny and ugly , i can never win this game i dont know what to do now i literally just wanna starve myself to death"
Recovery,"is it fat or water  Can you gain a mount of weight in a week ?
The Problem is; i cant eat thst much. I am still in recovery of an eating disorder and just get one meal on a day. And still Dont eat every day.
So I am trying to get myself up and eat every day or kinda more meals in a day.
So this week i went up really hard. Is this even possible ?
Is this bc my metabolism is still down ? Bc i got the feeling i restored Lots of fat in my knees ( thst is always the first Part getting bigger after i had a meal).
I cant imagine that this is all weight, but at the end of the week the Number of the scale wont get down..it is getting higher every day. 
Is there somebody can explain this to me ? I am frustrated. Is it maybe my full colon ? Or msybe water weight ? I am so Afraid thst my head want restriction again.

I also have to say i have corona this week..can there be water retention too?"
Disordered,"tw; relapse                                                  
i’m starting to relapse heavily right now. i don’t know honestly. whenever i starve myself i just feel more validated and such. constantly checking the scale to see if the number is going down too adds more too the validation because it feels like i’m in control and if i ever fuck up then i can starve myself and then gain pleasure from it when i see the number go down. i lost a lot of weight in the past few days and i’ve been averaging around a very low amount of calories a day. i think i’m relapsing and hard right now. i don’t know how to quit though. whenever i eat i feel so guilty i’m at a loss of appetite. i don’t know what to do. i’m so lost right now. it’s constantly straining."
Disordered,"Should I text a girl I barely know to ask if she needs help?  Hi! So lately, I've seen this girl I had met about 10 years ago at a summer camp post a lot of worrying stories of her on Instagram. It's always pictures where you can see that she has lost a lot of weight (she was already skinny to start with) and looks very sick. She didn't post as much before so I'm guessing that it's the illness pushing her to do it more at the moment. I don't know if she's completely oblivious to the fact that she's sick or if she knows but ""likes"" it or if she knows and is implicitly asking for help. I'm very worried.  
My question is: should I send her a message telling her that if she needs someone to talk to or advice I'm here? Or just telling her nicely that she needs to get help. I'm myself a pretty much recovered anorexic so I would not be coming out of nowhere.   
I'm just afraid that getting such a message would be a bit brutal but I'm also afraid that no one else is doing anything and that it might actually go downhill for here...

Any thoughts?"
Recovery,"Recovery related  I watched To the bone a few days ago .
There is this one scene where Elli got feed by her mother . Does this really helps ? I know it's weird af but did anyone had a good experience with it?"
Disordered,"I hate this, getting pissed at my mom for buying to much fruit  Logically I know it's stupid. I am usually almost the only one that eats the fruit at home, because of this my brain things that if my mom buys more fruit than I asked for that keans she wants to force me to eat it. Plus having more options at home stresses me the hell put and either triggers binges or me not eating for days. My brother saying ""you don't HAVE to eat anything"" doesn't help. I know he meants not anything specific I don't want/like but to me it sounds like he's telling me I don't need to eat and I want to prove that to b true. He and my mom tell me I need to learn to deal with it and that the world doesn't revolve around me and that she doesn't buy it for me. But that makes it worse, her buying stuff for me would be bad too I think.
Don't get me wrong I know I am the issue in this, it's no ones responsibility than mine but my head just messes with me. I hate how irritable this ilness made me. 
At thw same time I want my mom to buy things I like to eat to encourage me but she wouldn't do that anymore unless I asked. She does that because I couldn't hanlde it well in the past either. But somehow I wish she would.
Or I wish my brother wouldn't say ""but you wouldn't eat that anyway"" in regards to certain food that are fear foods of mine. 
I ruined it for myself. My family doesn't even ask me anymore if I want something when they are ordering takeout. I lost count how many times they ordered pizza or something without even asking me if I want something too. It hurts. I could never ask. 
This is just me ranting about how ana ruined my already bad relationship with my family.
I just came back from a road trip with my brother and we got into so many fights because my mood was ruined by a meal I ate. 
I'm so angry at myself because I gained weight and I'm not even underweight anymore. It just messes my head up more."
Recovery,Why Tf am I so damn bloated  I hate it I literally can not I can’t sleep bc of how fucking bloated I’m drinking plenty of water but I’m barely going to the bathroom like wtf is this a recovery thing and i start school in like less than a couple weeks am I not getting enough fiber like what’s going on  pls somebody tell me I can’t go to school bloated all year long
Recovery,"Anyone else have chronic indigestion and heartburn?  For the last 2ish years, I wake up almost every morning with heartburn or some sort of acid reflux.  It is so bad today that I thought I was having a heart attack and like I couldn'breathe a few hours ago, which was terrifying. I have seen doctors and wasn't diagnosed with GERD or anything like that. Today scared the shit out of me and I want to know if this is because of AN or if anyone else experiences or experienced something similar. 

Never thought I possibly had anorexia or disordered eating until a few years back when a friend put herself into full-time treatment and I weighed less than her at the same height. I've seen a nutritionist, and nobody is worried beside me because I don't meet every requirement for an AN diagnosis, and it isn't ARFID. Could be EDNOS but I am on birth control and I hate having a period and skip sugar pills for months at a time (Gyno said I could do it), I am afraid that if I stop taking it and realize I don't have a period I will have a full nervous breakdown. I am a ballet dancer and it's been hard to have enough stamina for class even after eating protein and higher-calorie foods all day until I go to class. I am not afraid of gaining weight, just not sure if I'd feel comfortable seeing myself at a normal body weight. I eat but often forget to if I'm busy since I work from home as a copywriter and content writer  so I and need both hands free. have alwaysnderweight or very thin since I was a child and I always have looked like this. But I am noticing more concerning things that I thought were normal but arent (always freezing, nails break and are thin, I have super thin hair and I shed to a point where I have no clue how I'm not bald, easily injured and takes forever to heal, bad insomnia, always exhausted) 

P.S. sorry for the long post. I don't have anyone I can talk about this with, and my friend, who I mentioned is 2 years into recovery, and I don't want to trigger her. I don't have anyone who could understand my situation or what this feels like physically and mentally."
Recovery,"is this common?  i've been in recovery for a while but then relapsed bad. now i'm starting to do better and i'm eating relatively normally each day. i used to be one of those people that could fast for hours (unfortunately for me hah) and i'd be fine, no sugar or pressure problems, nothing. but now, almost 6 years into my ed, if i don't eat for like 4 hours i get extremely weak, i get a headache, i feel faint and miserable, then i eat and feel better. is this something caused by my ed? can anyone relate? even pre-ed i never ate breakfast-lunch-dinner, i had a pretty weird eating schedule and now if i don't eat at least 3/4x times a day i feel h o r r i b l e.

anyone relate?"
Recovery,"Recovery?  There I days I think I'm eating normally or too much and I think I am probably on my way to recovery. Then my sister asks what I've eaten that day, I'd tell her expecting her to confirm just how much I've eaten and she'll just look at me like what have I eaten? Anyone else get their idea if what constitutes as a lot eschewed?"
Recovery,"Monte Nido and Rogers?  Been recommended for a HLOC by my outpatient team and trying to decide between these two (specifically MN Chicago). Does anyone have any experience with either or insight about what would make one a better choice over the other? I’ve been to Monte Nido once before at a different location and Rogers as an adolescent (probably 8 years ago now), and like the food philosophy at Monte Nido but am also struggling with exercise addiction and wonder if Rogers might be better with that? I really want to make this my last time in treatment and just want to make the right decision in seeking treatment by finding the best fit for me. Any other suggestions are also welcome!"
Recovery,"My ex slept with another girl 2 days after he dumped me and I want to relapse  My boyfriend of over a year and I had a very messy break up. He became very angry at me while drunk and while he didn’t harm me, he was very cruel and was so ashamed of his actions that he broke off the relationship. I was devastated. I wanted to relapse into my ED so badly but I managed to keep on track with recovery. I even challenged fear foods and felt proud of my progress despite my pain and desire to fall back on anorexia.

It has been a month since he dumped me but now my boyfriend is very regretful of his actions and says he was being a coward for running away from our relationship instead of taking responsibility and do better. I’m not ready to go back to the way things were, but I was hopeful we could rebuild trust and recover the relationship. Things were going pretty well - we met a few times to talk about things and the conversations were hard but helped a lot.

Then he told me he had sex with another girl while we were broken up (2days after he dumped me). He told me he felt sick about what he’d done and that she meant nothing to him, but finding this out has completely devastated me. I keep looking her up on social media, comparing her body to mine and if she’s thinner than me. Fighting off relapsing is getting harder and harder and I’m worried it’s going to be stronger than me now. I feel ashamed every time I eat and disgusted with myself. I feel like a fraud for wanting to return to anorexia while still eating food. I feel like a fraud. I miss my sick body and how being so sick overwhelmed everything else, especially my pain.

I’m trying to be strong but I want to give up. I never told anyone I was struggling because my sister has anorexia and was always sicker than me. Any recovery I’ve made, I have done alone and in secret. Does anyone have any suggestions for handling these negative emotions and my desire to relapse.

I can’t tell my family - my home life is loving but very chaotic and addiction/mental illness require a lot of attention. There’s just not space for me in that way.

TLDR: my ex wants to get back together but I found out he had sex with another girl. This has triggered my desire to relapse and I’m looking for advice to avoid backsliding"
Disordered,"Relapsing sounds like a wonderful idea right now  My depression has gotten bad again (not surprised at all) and I just feel like destroying myself in every possible way including relapsing into AN. 

I was not even close to recovered but I was doing better and now I don’t see the point in even trying to make things a little bit better. Maybe I am meant to stay in this cycle, I’ll even probably die from this soon and I couldn’t care less."
Disordered,"Feeling conflicted about treatment  I saw my dietician last week and she told me that if I continue to lose weight and lose ""insert number of pounds here"" before next session, that we will have to talk about finding more intensive treatment... Again. 

And the thing is, I'm pretty sure that we will be having that conversation and I am so frustrated at myself. I don't want to go into treatment yet again. I don't want to have to deal with that in addition to figuring out the rest of life stuff right now. And I don't want to gain weight? 

But at the same time, I also don't want to technically lose more weight. Just look different. And there is some part of me that just wants to be cared for and wants the attention and wants people to validate that, yes I am struggling and deserve help. Even though it feels like I don't, like it's not bad enough, and like I should be okay and don't deserve it. 

I'm just so conflicted and I hate feeling so stuck. My brain is constantly fighting me and it's so hard to seperate where stuff ends and where stuff begins?"
Disordered,"new here, hi:) just a tiny vent about how having an ED makes everyone around you assume a lot of stuff about you  so i’ve gotten treatment for my eating disorders (anorexia nervosa and PED) at the emily program. i had both a nutritionist and a therapist and eventually kept the same therapist after she went private. now that we have that established, i’m (for the most part) recovered. as you guys probably know, eating disorders can be triggered by certain things even while mostly recovered. so knowing all of this about myself, i went on a subreddit that was based on losing weight. i know that i’m overweight for my height and age and with other life issues i have, i wanted advice. i wanted a way to lose weight in a way that’s healthy and wouldn’t trigger me. the first and only comment i got from that post was that i needed professional help (even after i stated that i have it) and idk it just really made me sad. i know that eating disorders are serious, trust me, but i hate feeling like i’m an incredibly fragile “thing” that could break suddenly. maybe it’s just me idk but i hate it.
sorry for that rant i just wanted to talk about it with people who understand, if that makes sense"
Disordered,"Need advice!  So the thing is I haven’t met up with my friends in a while. So I’m planning to go out for lunch. But I’m already really really really stressing out even though plan isn’t confirmed yet. I’m on full restriction right now, so eating out would give me a full on panic attack. But I have to meet with them, if not now then later this month. If I do go, I can’t eat less since they don’t know about my ed and it’d just show them of my restrictive behaviour which I don’t want them to know. I do have the chance of cancelling it out saying I have some work coming up, and they’d be fine with that. I’m so confused on what I should do. I’m already hyperventilating on the thought of it and ik it’s just gonna get worse. And I’ve also lost a LOT of weight so when they see me they’re obviously gonna comment on how sick I look (they won’t mean to hurt me) which would just make me feel like shit and worser. I should just cancel right? I’m definitely not ready for it. Or maybe should I go out and do something else other than eating? Someone please help me"
Disordered,"I want to be there for my girlfriend  MHi everyone, I (21f) was wondering if you guys could give me some advice!

I have struggled (and maybe still do to an extent) with ED (and I have BDD) so I kind of understand ED and things like that. However, my girlfriend is in recovery for anorexia, but i have not experienced this myself. 

I’m wondering (from person experience or just advice), are there things I should know about being in a relationship with someone who has an ED (and is in recovery), are there things I should say or shouldn’t say, things I should keep an eye on? That type of thing. 

Another thing is too, she likes physical compliments, though I have no idea how to go about that besides the whole cute, beautiful thing. I don’t know what the right thing to say is. 

Thank you!"
Disordered,"seeing a woman in her 70's having more energy/strenght than you is scary  didn't ask her age but it must have been more than 70 yo! she was carrying 3 full bags (how?!), i was carrying only my everyday tote bag which isn't even heavy. i swear, she walked up the stairs of the subway station way faster than me and didn't seem to be slightly bothered about the weight. looked at her again when she went outside and still walking as fast! just having to walk to my office feels like such an hard task; i used to walk up the stairs too but now i gotta stick to the escalators; i don't have enough energy."
Disordered,"I want to quit IG but I can't  This girl I know is a aspiring model. She keeps on posting and I keep seeing her. She is so skinny and pretty I wish I could look like her. Everytime I see her I feel fat and ugly compared to her. I think it's so unfair that she's done nothing to deserve her looks, her popularity, and her lifestyle. Yes I am jealous, jealous as fuck. She was one of the people who tormented me back in my old school. She's an awful and vain person who pretended to be my friend so she could use me. She talked behind my back and joined in my classmates bullying me. She was only ever nice to me when she wanted something from me. I gave her what she wanted because I thought that she would leave me alone. I would be fine if she actually deserved the validation she was getting. I'm not saying I deserve it too. But when you see awful people get opportunities and gifts in life it just pisses you off. Usually I don't care about these things but after seeing one post of her flaunting her weight and exercise routine I snapped. Whenever I eat I think of how I look in comparison to her or other models or friends. I start feeling sick and excuse myself to the toilet and just start purging.


I know what you're thinking; Why not just block her? 


First, she'll know and it will obviously cause drama. I'm not the confrontational type. Also recently she's been tolerant of me, I don't want it to go back to how it was. I'm more than happy with her ignoring me or pretending I don't exist. We are in similar circles of friend groups, she's more popular and better liked and I don't want them to turn against me.

Second, A small part of me wants to be like her. She has what I always wanted in myself. Beauty, self acceptance, and validation from others.

 I'm ashamed to admit all this so I created an alt. I just had to let it all out. Please don't judge me for this."
Disordered,"They want to care now but I don't want them to  When I only had disordered eating, before descending completely into the hellhole that is AN, I tried to reach out to close family member and a friend that I had an eating disorder. I tried to describe to them what was happening. All I got was a eat o or just eat from my friend and a just don't lose too much weight from my family member. They didn't take it seriously at all. Now that I've dropped a ton of weight they're getting worried and telling me not to become ""an0rexic"". But I no longer want help or to confide about it to them. It's just too late."
Recovery,life is so much more than food  I really felt smth yesterday and I want to try to use it to motivate some of yall. Ive always known life can be bautifull and filled with so much joy we just close our eyes to see we burry our heads in this world where nothing else exept our weight and food matter when in reality this trully is the least important thing. We are so much more than our temporare home(the bodies we abuse) our souls are aching to set themselves free and experience all the wonders life has to offeer feel all the emotions and sometimes just be.Im gonna sound like a 50 year old facebook lady but the universe is so big and full of oppertunity magick and hope and we just need to slowly learn to see it. We dont live to count our cals and plan the food we are ab to eat or the one we arent.We are beautiful human beings all we have to do is exist in a way that makes us feel and experience the world we live in look at the stars dance in the forest go on night drives travel meet new people fall in love. If you are sick of everyone making recovery all ab food and eating it is not only that its what comes after after we give life to our tired bodies after we start taking care of ourselves and allow our minds and bodies the love and rest they need.All of us are capeble of change and no matter how hard it is we can do it because we are better than that we are better than romantisizing our litteral death. This thing inside of us is just trying to blind us put us in a cage and kill us but only if we allow it too.I can go on and on this  is by far not even 1%of what i have to say but ill need to stop.Fight and dont lose hope there is light at end of the tunnel I promise you 🍀
Recovery,sometimes you just have to say f- it and eat the damn lemon pie  
Disordered,"What the fuck are hunger and fullness cues  Recovery is unveiling some bad psychological damage restrictions left me with. In restriction I used my emotions to gauge wether or not I was gonna eat…hungry or not it didn’t matter, if I felt I could control myself if I ate then it’s a go - usually that meant eating when I wasn’t “hungry” And being very clearly hungry and wanting food badly…usually meant I wasn’t eating. And now I have these weird associations with hunger like guilt and shame and panic of running in the other direction. But i’m also not actively trying to restrict…so I don’t need to feel as in control around food as I once did…so now wanting food is being mistaken for hunger. Idk man…it’s all so fucked up recovery is so hard I feel like i’m walking tightrope and on either end is some terrible fate waiting to eat me. This is gonna sound weird but recovery is starting to feel like damage control."

Disordered,"it's fucking horrible having anorexia but a body that REFUSES to look thin.  to a point, i think this may be body dysmorphia, but i genuinely just don't look my weight. im considerably underweight, no numbers but it's to the point where it's concerning. but i don't look my weight in any way whatsoever. ive had people straight up tell me i look xxlbs bigger. i have absolutely no muscle definition so even if i look somewhat thin standing up, when i sit my body just squishes and doubles in size. everything jiggles. im trying so hard to recover because i feel horrible and am having really scary symptoms (heart is absolutely fucked, can't breathe, constant headache and brainfog, really weak, ect) but how the fuck am i supposed to recover when i never saw myself as sick anyways? i want to exercise and develop more muscle but i feel too tired and weak to. when i try to eat normally my brain just fucking screams at me. it's hard to describe without numbers but i truly don't look my weight. im disgusted with myself and embarrassed. ig im not ready to fully recover but it still takes so much energy and willpower to prevent myself from getting any worse, but every time i see myself in the mirror or look down to see my thighs or hands or arms and how big they look, i just wanna get worse and starve to death. fml. does anyone else struggle with this?? if so how do you cope with it??"
Disordered,"Do feel comfortable talking to your general practitioner about Ed related issues?  My dietitian wanted me to start taking ensure for bad eating days.

Disordered,"Anorexia and rage  For anyone else, is anorexia a way of losing control? The only way? I can't be aggressive with anyone else, I know nobody is responsible for the way I feel, I'm usually apathetic, but sometimes a feeling of ""I can't take it anymore"" bursts and the most concrete way to feel clean again is not eating, cutting the ties with the outside world, a world that fills me up to the point of nausea but doesn't satisfy me, anorexia turns the unbearable emptiness manageable."

Are there any signs who show up before ?"
Disordered,"Is a dietician/nutritionist actually helpful and why?  I’ve been restricting and exhibiting other eating disorder behaviors for awhile now.

Regardless, I will continue to see my regular therapist for anxiety, depression, and trauma.

My question is: what is the value of a dietician or nutritionist? In your experience how has that been valuable for you? Should I also be looking into an eating disorder specific therapist? 

Also, does anyone have any experience in self-directed eating disorder recovery?

Disordered,"Need advice on how to help my gf  Since my girlfriend (F28) was 18, she has been experiencing pain in her lower abdomen, gastritis, and constipation. When she's in pain, she doesn't eat and this has caused a severe weight loss. She went through a lot of tests (for celiac disease, gastroscopy with a biopsy, colonscopy, CT scans, NMRs, rectal manometry, blood tests, etc.) and none of them helped identify her problem.
Lately her constipation got really really bad, to the point where she needs a micro-enema every day to pass a stool; if she doesn't, she immediately starts experiencing pain in her lower left abdomen and the more she waits before going, the worse this pain gets.
I'm starting to think it might be a mental issue, like atypical anorexia nervosa and I would like some kind of feedback before suggesting this different approach to my gf.
What do you guys think?"
Disordered,"Theory about recovery  I'm trying every possible strategety to overcome my anorexia and just convince myself to f*cling eat.

I know that the best solution would be to go into the hospital but I know that this is never going to happen m So I have to get my shit together alone . So obviously I'm not a therapist and the only thing I can do is to eat and find some information on the internet to ""treat"" myself.
My question is : 

Is it possible to recover by eating enough so you get to your normal BMI again and trying to face the fear over certain food over and over again ?
Can doing the opposite of the things you fear normalize this fear or do really need a therapist?"
Recovery,"Maybe this will help someone?  Yesterday I was talking with my dietitian about how I don’t feel that I deserve treatment or am sick enough to need any interventions.

We went through the appointment and at the end she said: you do deserve treatment, you deserve to get better, and there’s no cut off for seeking help - you can still have appointments with me even if you’re 150% recovered.

I felt really emotional hearing that and very reassured - I’m on a waiting list for inpatient and worry that if I make improvements I won’t be accepted (I really think it will help a lot with recovery). Anyway - maybe this will help someone like it helped me!"
Disordered,"I’ve been recovered for 3 years but I still feel like falling apart whenever I see myself in photos or acknowledge my body’s existence  So, as the title says, I’m recovered and know that my body is “healthy.” However, whenever I see photos of myself I just fall apart. I even cover my face on my employee badge because it’s like any kind of acknowledgment I exist is a punch to the gut. I don’t know how to escape this cycle of complete self-misery surrounding photos or images. I know I’m better, physically, but whenever I see myself all I can see is a monster. If someone asked me to draw a self-portrait of myself it’d probably not look how I actually do at all. I don’t think the way I see myself is how I look in reality at all. 

I plan on getting more help for how I’m feeling but it’s just really hard to never feel “pretty,” as shallow as that sounds.

ok so two different things they’ve just both been on my mind.

first thing - i weighed myself for the first time since last year (before i was anorexic) and now i’m underweight and i’m very happy about that but also no one talks about downsides. my clothes are all big on me now. the clothing i bought only a month ago. i’m proud of myself but it’s also such a struggle wearing too big clothes.

second thing - today i ate four cookies and i feel like absolute shit. i feel so guilty and i’m disgusted with myself. i don’t want to eat at all till tomorrow but i have to eat dinner with my mom in a couple of hours but i really am dreading it. i’ve eaten too much today - the only other thing i had was a banana for breakfast but i just wanted cookies so bad and kept going back."

Recovery,"Do you know who you are?  After a long and descent talk she finally found out, that she has to change things in her life and tries to recover. While discussing some interesting things came to light. But first some facts:
- She has AN since 9 and is 38 now.
- she has three kids, one of them, the youngest, is mine
- the ex partner and father of the other two kids has the mission to make her life as bad as possible, because he hates his self even more. Unfortunately he is a good father though. 
- She struggles with her emotions, kids training, trying to get everything in her family life together and to manage that she fled into excessive sports and low food input.

I found some interesting things out, maybe you are familiar with that. Maybe you could help me to let her help herself: 

- she recalls her entire life to be focused on her weight. This always gave her control.
- she does not know who she actually is and what the things are, that she loves. There is none.
- to compensate the lack of her own desires, she gives everything she has to her kids. Those are struggling too, due to the years of cruel legal and emotional fights with the ex.
- because she never had contact with herself, she cannot gain energy, her only desire is to do sports and an stuff
- so now, after many exhausting years in her living situation she finds herself in a decent mother's burnout with hard depressions and an growing urge of controlling her weight. 

Her life is a mess, and so is mine now. As I am not living with her, I wish she could let the kids go and move to me and stops fighting for them because it destroyes her. Not a noble thought, I know. But who could judge me, most do not know how exhausting and messy all this is. And I think this would be the best for all of us, especially for the children. But she as a mother with no other purpose in her life than living for them and barely no self awareness, is so scared doing the step, because there is nothing waiting for her. Well I am. And our little 3y old son. But she cannot see this.

I believe she never knew what selfcare actually is. Do you?"

She’s now not going out for dinner again. I’m really worried as she’s been losing weight for a while. She says she just can’t eat but after I questioned her admitted she hasn’t been eating right. 

She doesn’t want to be as thin but has no appetite anymore, drinks alcohol everyday (long-standing problem). It’s not a weight control thing. Just not hungry. I’ve realised - and she’s admitted she’s been lying about eating to not make me worry. 

To be honest I’m really worried. She has COPD already, health issues and now this. She’s 56 and in the UK.

Disordered,"Wish i was bigger.  (Trigger warning restricting and starving)

Ever since i got to a weight that it was noticeable to other people they started worrying and questioning me about me eating and telling me to eat more. When i was bigger and restricting it didnt bother them the amount i ate, anyway not as much as now. If i was bigger again i would be able to starve and restrict again and people wouldnt bother me about it. I know recovery is the only way but i miss being in control i guess.
Does anyone else feel like this?"
Disordered,"feeling guilty.  Some background: recently my antidepressant medication has been making me have a lack of appetite, and while the rational side of me wants to mention this to my psychiatrist theres a side of me thats happy about this. Ive been going through hard times recently and just a few weeks ago my best friend not only mocked me for opening up to them but ghosted me aswell. this heartbreak led me to start starving myself. At first i wasnt sucessful and i told myself i wouldnt go through with this anymore- but i think ive unintentionally developed an ED. today i wanted to not eat anything at all. which sounds hard, but my med's side effect helped. Unfortuneatly i just couldnt control myself and ate a brownie. it tasted great, but then the guilt set in. i want to punish myself by not eating, i feel like i dont deserve the luxury of food. im just disapointed in myself."
Disordered,"Vent  I just need to vent. Today is the day of the week that I usually let myself have freedom with food. So, tonight is my last chance to just eat freely and not have to restrict.

And I really want to make myself some supper, but making and eating food in front of my sister makes me so anxious.

Well, the thing is that she's in the living room right now and if I make food, she'll see me taking it to my room. And that makes me really anxious and I feel like she's going to judge me. So, I just can't. But I really just want to eat something. I mean, I did eat earlier, but I'm hungry again.

And like, my break day is going to be ruined. This always happens. It makes me so frustrated. She's in the living room all day, just watching TV, and I don't even have a fucking second of privacy in the kitchen where I don't feel like she's watching me. I just wish she would go to her room for just five minutes so I could make some food. 

And I'm also really tired and I want to sleep, but if I do then my break day will be over and I'll have to be back at restricting again.. So by the time she finally goes to bed, I'll be fucking exhausted and barely able to enjoy this day before I'm back to restricting.

I just feel like crying. I feel so frustrated and so angry and I'm sorry if this post sounds aggressive. I know it's not her fault, but I just feel so angry anyway."

Disordered,"Parents and 3 week vacation has destroyed me.  I can’t blame my parents but this may have destroyed me.  I’m so defeated. 

We went overseas to meet new family and they were very pushy about food. But what hurt me the most is that my parents would not listen when I would say no.

“Try this” “you will regret it” “don’t you like there food” “awww you don’t like my food”  then when I finally give in to try make them shut up. They say something like “oh see you did want it” the guilt that causes is so bad.

Constantly jabbing me and telling me and asking me to try things over and over again until I give in. 

I could say no 10x and they still keep going when I say no.

I’ve been a healthy weight for a while now and I eat pretty normally so there is 0 reason for them to nag me.

My step mom even delt with Ed for a very long time before I meet her. But she seems to say the most triggering things. 

They both know what I use to deal with but they just push my buttons constantly. Because of this, the fears and thoughts are coming back. I looked at the scales because of this. Seeing I’ve gained even more weight made me lose it. 

I just don’t understand I’m 18 and I’ve done everything right. I stoped counting calories I gained weight i stoped the scales. I got a-lot better. I eat the right amount .  I did it all right.

But they seem to think it’s a great idea to mention how much I’m eating. Or joke about how we will gain weight on this vacation. Or constantly push food on me. I tell them it makes me uncomfortable but they keep doing it….. why why why do they have to mention food,weight it’s so bad. They even post pictures of me with them on social media . I look so bad it’s horrible.

Disordered,"Sexism and misogyny in treatment  A recent post in another (non Ed) sub made me wonder about the way that sexism affects treatment for EDs. Eating disorders are a stereotypically female disorder (though of course men are affected too) and I know many of us have had horrifying and traumatic experiences in treatment. 

I wonder how you all think that sexism affects how we’re treated for eating disorders?

Personally, I think if EDs were perceived as a male disorder, treatment would be a lot different. My experience of treatment was that it was patronizing, controlling and invalidating in a way that feels somehow reflective of how it is to be a woman in society. I don’t think we’re that evolved from treatment of hysteria, or ridiculous Freudian ideas about women. I’m having a hard time articulating my thoughts on this but would love to hear others’ thoughts and experiences even if you disagree."

Unlike people who start to self harm at some point in their “dieting” journey, I always thought I’d stop as soon as I become attractive. Idk what that really is because I am already underweight but I assume anorexia wants me too loose some more before I look “beautiful”. In truth, I don’t think I would have ever had this disorder if my hips and breasts weren’t tiny. My biggest trigger is seeing my stomach stick out past my chest even tho it is still relatively flat. I feel like I would have never starved myself or broken down over my belly if I had boobs. Maybe I’m delusional. I just feel so gross sometimes. I feel like I’m too big and not feminine enough. The only girls with no boobs that I see online have no fat on their bellies, basically extremely thin. That’s why I think I should look the same."

The worst part for me isn’t even that I’m “missing out” on eating fun foods/eating events, I’m used to that. The worst part is the horrible, selfish person I become when I restrict.

Disordered,"Is there a safe way to talk about nutrition?  Background information: I work at a gym and I'm in the national guard so fitness and health should be important to me. Most people think I look pretty good and fit but the army always tells me I'm overweight though I always pass bmi tests.  I can barely maintain my physique through working out and I know my diet is the problem. I have very poor portion and impulse control/ eat lots of junk food and generally all of whatever I've gotten.  One time I felt good about my appearance I was in an intense deficit and work out routine but I was miserable then I regained the weight and lost the gains.  Since ive been trying to be better be healthier but ive run into a situation where I've discovered (at different times) several people I work with are in recovery.  It's always like hey have a donut and I'm like I shouldn't I ate huge tub of popcorn last night and they're like it was really hard for me to have this.  Or another time it hadn't even crossed my mind someone brought in a lot of something that looked great and I said I haven't worked hard enough for that and someone responded with you don't have to earn your food.  
The point is I participate in a sport and occupation that benefits from being in a healthy weight range,  I want my body to feel better about moving my mass around and i just want to be better without trying to offend or disturb others who have a make a concentrated effort to eat at all.  It makes me just not wanna talk at all about food even though I feel like I'm struggling with the opposite problem.  Ive never been diagnosed or anything so it's probably just a discipline thing on my side, I'm kind of a chronic sharer of things I feel are difficult for me and maybe that's the real problem.

Once you reach x lbs, this disease will give you another “goal weight”. Guess what? This disease has only one goal: death. This disease will feed you lies and tell you that the only outcome of restriction is weight loss. It’s not. This disease will destroy your body and mind. Organ failure, destroying your teeth enamel, osteoporosis, your body eating at your muscles because there’s not enough fat in your body, digestive issues, etc.

Disordered,"Doom  I feel so utterly broken. I've been dealing with anorexia since I was 12. I went through some very traumatic things because of it. My life wasn't mine because of others. I turned 18 in May and things were going good for the past year and I saw hope. I got my GED, I was no longer at the mercy of idiotic, sadistic even higher ups. 

My weight has been pretty low for the past year. I was eating well and not restricting. Not under the constant threat of hospitals. I was just living life at a weight I felt comfortable at with some ups and downs.

Gradually over the past couple of months I've been eating less. I was so tired of rigidly eating six times a day and so on a vacation I tried out eating more intuitively and it felt amazing. When I came back home I had lost some weight but not much. My team was happy about my positive experience and hoped I could replicate it at home without losing weight. Doing so proved challenging. I ended up just eating less. At one point I got to a number that was a little shocking. Deep down though, it felt good. I went up about a pound from that and maintained for a bit. 

Last week was my first weight in a couple of weeks. I can't remember my weight beforehand exactly but the general range. The number couldn't have been up a lot but just seeing it broke my heart. For the first time in years the scale made me cry. I hadn't tried to lose weight intentionally in quite a while but I decided it was time. I barely ate for a few days and quickly could hardly function. I slowly had to begin eating more. By the end of the week I was doing pretty good and I felt good in my body. 

This morning I awaited the scale, looking for the relief of loss. The appointment was hostile to begin with. When I stepped on the scale, at first I couldn't process it. It was like it wasn't real. Somehow, it was a pound **up** from last week. The number broke me. Tears flooded. I was miserable. How, how? What can I do? I ate less and went up? My weakness led the scale up? This has never happened before. I've often quite easily lost weight. I already felt a little pathetic for already being lethargic after a few days of starvation, now I feel hopeless. I haven't eaten all day. I'm just a pile of lethargy and depression. I can hardly manage doing nothing. My whole life I've had the vision of me just fading away into nothingness. Becoming an invalid. Is that how it ends?"
Disordered,why does it make me so dependaant  I hate it.I can barely go on trips cause my parents know i wouldnt eat. I cant go 2 days without having to come home and eat in front of them.Im 16 im not a baby I wish i could just take care of myself
Disordered,"I’m Hungry  I’ve only eaten about half a small honeydew melon today and it’s now 9:00pm 

I’ve been thinking about weetabix and other cereal, McDonald’s and KFC, all things I love but just don’t want to eat

It’s like my brain is trying to torture me"
Disordered,"I hate it.  I hate how this b•tch  is making me lie to the ones i love. Wanna recover but at the same time i feel the need to stay here and mess everything up with myself and others.  
I genuinely don’t know where the hell put my hands,"
Disordered,"Medication Fears  I’ve been struggling a lot with my mental health and my doctor thinks I should begin anti-depressants and antipsychotics but I’m terrified of of gaining weight by taking them so I stopped going to my doctor and going to therapy out of shame and fear. 

My quality of life right now is horrible and these medications might significantly improve everything but I’m terrified if I see my body get bigger I’ll end up hurting myself worse than I am currently"
Recovery,"I(f16) need advice from those of you with eating disorders  I’ve been struggling with anorexia since 7th grade and I’m now going in to my junior year of high school. So, I’m going into my fifth year of dealing with this god forsaken eating disorder, and, well, I’m really tired. 

Pretty much everyone in my life knows about my ED, that is, except for my family. 

Lately, I’ve been struggling a lot. I only really eat one meal a day, which is better than nothing I suppose, but still isn’t very good. For the past like three or four days, I’ve felt really sick every morning. I’m really nauseous and my stomach hurts and it just goes on for a couple hours until it just eventually goes away. And, well, I don’t know how much longer I can put up with it. 

I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired. I need help, I know I do. I want to get better, I want to recover, I want to eat healthily. But I just don’t know how to do that on my own. I’m terrified of how my family will react and what will happen.

So, to those of you struggling with eating disorders and have sought out help, how did you go about it? What was your experience? What would you have done differently? How did your family react? Really, any information or shared experiences would do me good.

TL;DR: I’m (f16) struggling with anorexia and want to get help, but don’t know how to go about it. I’m scared of my family’s reaction. Does anyone have any advice on how to go about getting help?"
Recovery,Is it normal for this to happen when you’re not eating  Usually people will say their cranky or angry when their hungry but for me I feel light and kind of happy sometimes if I feel my stomach rumbling it makes me feel good knowing that I’m not putting on weight with food I know and I feel like I’m clean but whenever I eat I feel like I’ve gained so much weight and I feel dirty in my own body
Recovery,feel off  just feel off all the time  even when i eat i don’t feel guilty just poorly and feel just off joints hurt random pains is that normal
Disordered,"i'm scared my bf won't find me attractive anymore  so i've been in recovery for a while now, ate good, worked out, felt confident. however... i relapsed. and i relapsed hard. ruined most of my gym process, my butt got smaller and i'm bony and soft-ish. my bf is very supportive and always encourages me to do better and take good care of myself. not once did he comment on my low weight or made me feel bad. however... we all know how fucked up our self esteem gets during difficult times. for the last few days i've been thinking about whether my bf won't find me attractive anymore soon. i'm working hard on getting better and i feel like i might get better soon but it just sucks, a lot. does anyone relate? how do you comfort yourself during these times? i can't talk to him about it because even if he did feel less attracted to me, knowing him - he'd never admit it."
Disordered,"Throwing up (not bulimia) (TW?)  My body throws up food?? Not on purpose??

Reddit don’t take this down I’m not explaining anything in a negative way I just need help.

There have been two nights over the past I think two weeks where I ate a lot of food all at once. Well it was a lot for me because I don’t eat lol. Both times were around 8/9. Then around 2 in the morning I threw it all up. Both days I woke around 2/3 in the afternoon and didn’t eat until 8/9. Both those days and last week I have been burping a lot not the good kind lol. I was also randomly gagging a lot. Especially at the thought of food. I think taking my nighttime pills were the biggest trigger. 

Does anyone know why it happened? Any solutions? 

My mom and I came up with just eating little things throughout the day instead a lot all at once."
Disordered,possible anorexia?  I'm pretty underweight and lately I've been having trouble eating. I'll have days where I eat alot and then suddenly I'll have a couple days where I can't stand food and just force some ramen noodles down my throat out of concern. I feel hungry obviously but the sight of food just doesn't excite me and I feel like throwing up sometimes while thinking of eating. My therapist has been concerned about my weight but we haven't gotten down to why I might be avoiding food and tbh I don't really understand why either. Any advice is helpful
Disordered,"i’m relapsing, but now no one wants to deal with me  last year, i posted on here after being discharged from the hospital, although i was on the brink of death. many things have changed since then… i decided to go “all in” (i don’t even know what made me start eating normally again, it just happened) but then it quickly turned into binge eating. i gained 20 kg in around 3 months, and i became weight-restored. of course, gaining so much weight in little time had its consequences. my stomach was permanently bloated, my face was puffy and my thighs seemed huge to me. i decided to go on a self-made diet 2 weeks ago (i don’t have money to afford a dietitian, and now that it’s summer they’re on vacation anyways), but turns out i’m relapsing. i’m starting to fear food again, i drink 0 cal drinks to suppress my hunger, i count calories again. i think this happened (also) because i saw some pics of me from last year, and i realised how much i miss my old body. everything happened so fast, i swear relapsing didn’t even cross my mind at first. my mum has noticed my behaviour and she has already told me that after almost witnessing me die she is not willing to put up with me because she’s tired and i’m almost 19, so choosing whether to eat or not is only my responsibility. i am completely alone, even the online friends i had last year have completely abandoned me. i had a very special friend who was happy i was recovering, she always tried to support me, but after i ghosted her multiple times (due to my mental issues) she told me she didn’t want to speak to me ever again because i hurt her. it made me feel so shitty, and i still feel terrible. honestly, i just want to disappear right now. i can’t believe i’m spiraling into anorexia again…. this time i don’t think i will have the energy to fight against this monster. maybe i was bound to lose this battle from the start"
Disordered,"I used to have atypical anorexia, diagnosed in 2017.  However I feel like I’m falling back into old habits due to my new medications make me giving me constant nausea and not to tmi but it also clears my stomach out Lmfao. Which reminds me of when I abused laxatives. I feel the most stable and happiest mentally I’ve felt in 7 years. But I’ve also lost 35-40 lbs in about 41 days now? I am glad to lose the weight but I’m really not sure how to not be anorexic , I always fall back into these habits and I did want to go back to the gym but I’m afraid it’ll exacerbate my symptoms."
Disordered,wanting to go back  the fact that people know that i eat makes me extremely uncomfortable. uncomfortable to the point where if people see me eating i have to stop and throw it away and try not to cry. uncomfortable to the point where i never want to eat again when i think about how so many people have seen me eat food or talk about eating food before. when i started at my new job i made a promise that i wouldnt eat at work so nobody there would know i ate. and today i broke that promise and i feel like absolute shit. i can never ever go back and i want to quit now. i love my job and i hate that i want to quit because people know that i eat that is so goddamn stupid.
Disordered,"Liver damage and medications  If my liver is slightly damaged from my ED, does that have any effects on medications I may take? Like if a start an antidepressant that’s metabolized in the liver, does anyone know if that fact that my liver is damaged will change the way the medication affects me?

Also, I’m not positive that my liver is damaged but I have pains over there sometimes. I’m not able to get in with a doctor to check for a little bit, and honestly I’m not even sure how they’ll check that. But those who have had their liver damaged from anorexia (but not to the point of cirrhosis), was the treatment simply to eat more/ better?"
Disordered,why is no one trying to help?  I’m a 14 year old girl and I’ve been on an fbt treatment for nearly a week now. I’ve not eaten anything in almost 4 days. I feel weak and tired but I can’t even look at food. Tonight I was actually going to try eat my last snack of the day however my parents placed down what they know is my biggest fear food. The last two times they offered me it I have bawled my eyes out and struggled to even look at it. They purposely did this to torment me. I feel so stupid to think they even cared about me. They just constantly tell me it’s ‘ non-negotiable’ and I have to eat exactly what I’m given or nothing. It’s such a joke I have already struggled with 2 past attempts to take my own life and I have never wanted to more than now. No matter how much I try explain or say this treatment isn’t going to work they don’t listen. I want nothing more in the world to just pass away peacefully in my sleep. I’m done with everything I don’t think I can hit anymore rock bottom.
Disordered,"Why does hunger make me feel like this?  Like... high, floaty, light?

Other people say they feel crappy if they get hungry. 

For me I get this... high. And I just wonder why? Is there some brain difference in people with AN? I'm just curious about the mechanism."
Disordered,food intolerances  once i started eating again i get pain for eating certain foods like sugar and cheese
Disordered,Has anyone else been on Prozac?  What was your experience? I’m being prescribed it by someone who doesn’t specialize in Ana or ED’s and I’m worried.
Recovery,"big meals and bodys  Why i feel bigger after one day of eating?

I am still in Anorexie recivery.but i am trying to eat daily.
So the last days i could not eat that much; it Was half of a Joghurt so far; . But yesterday i dont felt tjat good and made myself a burrito, where i ate also the half of it.
Directly after eating my body felt like He stored much fat on it.
Also today i feel much bigger, like i gained one pound of fat. Somenody csn help me? Bc of this feeling i restricted all day and cant get my head to eat sth.
Is this fat i gained bc i ate more i usually did the last tine ?
Did i gain bc my metabolism is still slowed down ??"
Recovery,could this be due to anorexia  could this be due to anorexia  any time i eat dairy now or sugar i get a tingling sensation in my legs
Disordered,"I love my parents but sometimes they can be so unhelpful  I'm currently recovering and it's going decently I guess. My food intake is much better but I still have other issues going on (I developed extreme pickiness and some allergies that weren't present before).

But sometimes my parents are the worst at just not saying anything. My mom is trying, but she doesn't understand a lot, and I don't think my dads fully internalized the fact that this is a thing.

The main issue on my mind rn is yogurt and granola. I was already apprehensive about it due to calories but I've managed to tackle it and am fairly comfortable eating it now. For some reason though my parents love to comment on how much I'm eating. About a month ago my mom made a comment like ""maybe start with less than that, you can always go back for seconds but leftover yogurt is never good!"" She noticed that I didn't eat it afterwards and apologized but it stopped me from eating it at all for like 2 weeks. Then today, my dad made a similar comment. Maybe I am just having a lot idk.

They also have made comments about how much healthier I look now and all that. It's not helpful at all but I know they're trying. Like part of me wants to be unhealthy.

I think that they think I've recovered. Like it's not impacting me at all anymore. I eat more than before but I still struggle with the mental aspect of it, not to mention I've cut out a lot of foods that have good nutrients (I can't stand any meat so my iron is low), plus TW here ||I started cutting myself and I'm really experiencing the side effects of blood loss rn due to how often it happens, I guess it's what I'm doing instead of restricting to maintain some sense of control||. My parents think I'm all fine now since one thing has improved but honestly it's worse now.

They do it with so many things too, not just eating. I'm trans, ftm, and my mom made a comment the other day about the way that I walk. I tend to pass as androgenous (if I say I'm a boy ppl think I'm a cis boy, if I say I'm a girl ppl think I'm a cis girl), and she said ""well if anyone's confused about your gender, your walk is certainly an indicator"" and now I can't stop thinking about how my hips and legs move when I walk. She also regular points out acne, sideburns, hair, just a lot of things about appearance really that do not help me at all.

But I know they love me and I love them. I know they're trying. It's just hard sometimes yk."

Disordered,"how not to relapse when being discharged from ed services  some background info; i have been doing family therapy since feb 2021 and during that time i had a period at the beginning where i was gaining weight then things went downhill and i lost all of it and plateaued at a low weight then i gained some back but then plateaued at that weight (which is slightly underweight according to bmi) and that’s been the case since jan this year. however bc i have done over a year of ‘therapy’ which was not consistent and effective i am being discharged on the 10th of august. their reasoning for this is that i am ‘stable’ they have said themselves im still underweight but that i need to do it myself and that there isn’t any more tools they can give me and they need to take on other referrals. i am 16 and about to start at college (UK) and this is such a bad time to discharge and i was just wondering how im meant to cope and how i can keep making actual progress

Hearing how hurt they have been by AN is what’s motivating me. I hate that it’s hurt them and wish I could take it away."
Disordered,"I will forever resent that I am naturally bigger-bodied  There. I said it. My therapist and I had a hard conversation today. She asked me if I had any underlying medical conditions, such as IBS or thyroid imbalances. She suggested getting my hormones checked. She wasn’t discrediting me nor my anorexia diagnosis (I’ve been seeing her for nearly a year and she is very supportive) but it was just a hard pill to swallow. I always have, and will likely always be, a bigger bodied person.

I was a tall child and always overweight, I’ve battled with my weight all my life, and my eating disorder is making everything spiral. And now I’m trying not to cry because I hate it, and can’t help but wonder why me, when all the women in my family were slim at my present age. I’m at a healthy weight now, but l still don’t look it."

Recovery,"No idea how to eat normally  I've struggled with disordered eating since 8th grade, binging + purging + restriction (mainly restricting). I've started recovering about a month ago and my eating habits have totally flipped, going from restricting to horrible overeating. Like, I can't go 2 hours without being super hungry.  I feel incredibly guilty about it, like I'm convinced genuinely nobody eats as much as I do (probably not true but that's what my brain is telling me). Any of y'all went through the same thing and have tips on how to get over it?"
Disordered,"Worked up courage for hours to eat a frozen pizza I bought and my roommate ate it.  Not diagnosed anorexic but I'm underweight because of disordered eating. I decided today that I was going to try to eat more and bought a low cal frozen pizza. I left it in the freezer while I was at work and worked up the courage throughout my shift to eat it when I got home. 

I was actually beginning to look forward to it and I fully wanted to eat it. Then when I got home it turns out my new roommate (who has proved to be nightmarish in only two days) already ate it.

I bought pizza because I love it and I knew it could tempt me to eat. Now I'm pissed at my roommate but also relieved I don't have to eat. Which is not how I want to feel. I want to be able to eat and get better.

Anyway, this sounds stupid and childish but I just wish that food didn't have to always be stressful in one way or another."

Disordered,"Holidays=triggering. help  Im on Holidays over to my family who keep triggering me into restricting again and bringing back all the food thought. Still have 5 days to spend with them but im scared it will lead to a full on relapse.

First my cousin keeps on saying how they only live off of water and air or complain about only eating one sandwich during the day. Saying stuff like i have to wait to be allowed to eat or im so fat (we're the same size). This started after she saw my phone and saw all the ed content so she asked if i have one and then looked at my whole day eating.

My father (obese) practically only talks of healthy foods and best diets and mentions calories in different foods while comparing them to others. He also judges what or how i eat and makes me eat breakfast and dinner with him. 

My aunt, the first thing she said to me when we met was ""we gotta fatten you up a bit"" which too made me uncomfortable cause she was looking at the way i look.

Lastly im in a hot country so i have to only wear shorts and t-shirts. I burned myself unporpose the first day to have an excuse to keep a shirt on when in water and there is no way i would take my shorts off even when it made them mad or question me."
Disordered,"Does diet coke lead to weight gain?  I heard a lot about that sweetener lead to weight gain because it's changing the metabolism ? Is this true , does anyone has more information about it? Does it also count for my anorexic ass?"
Disordered,"need a reason to stop restricting? idk  Painful mouth ulcers made me start eating less, and though I had gone through a lot in recovery, restriction started creeping in. 

(Tw, im not pro ana but the following words are my own thinking and might sound pro ana)

I enjoy seeing the numbers on the scale drop, cuz why not? Lighter is good, skinnier is good. 

I developed rules of my own: I should only eat during meal times because if I eat more out of meal times it's breaking the rules and the look of my body will be out of control. I sneakily try to skip meals, because what would even happen if i eat one meal less? Nothing, right?

I feel hunger, cold feet and easily dizzy when i stand up from a sitting or laying position. But that's all, no big deal, which makes me think it's okay to restrict, and beneficial.

Since I've been through a lot of recovery I know that this time, i might currently be in the butterfly phase, and feeling good when i restrict.

I do know the long term health effects, such as heart problems, stomach problems, high cholesterol, brain fog, lose of bone density, malnutrition, losing teeth, hair loss...I've even experienced some of them. I also know how painful recovery can be. I will never forget the crazy extreme hunger and bowel problems. But since I'm just starting restriction again i don't feel like it will get that bad and i haven't experience bad health effects yet.

The reason that made me start recovery last time was, i got tired of being controlled by food, i felt trapped, i thought i could stop whenever i wanted but when i actually wanted to stop, i couldn't.

""I thought I could stop whenever I wanted but when I actually wanted to stop, I couldn't"".... I think I just convinced myself for a little bit that I shouldn't restrict. But it's not enough for my stubborn mind. I'm conflicted within continue to restrict and stop before it's too late. It would be helpful if someone could help convincing me."

One time I couldn't take it anymore and had a mental breakdown. I said too much stuff abt me hating myself and she threatened to put me in a mental hospital.

Disordered,"Never been diagnosed but I feel like I can't lose weight healthily?  So being a male, no one has ever taken me seriously as having an eating disorder. When I was 22, I started a shake diet, I was overweight and quickly started to shed the pounds. Somewhere in between that, I went through a breakup and I completely just shut down.

Its so hazy now looking back. I stopped eating and used to fake eat to please people. I used to only ever eat half of my dinner, and I was always itching to eat less each time. I don't think I even realized I lost weight. It was only when my parents intervened, that I woke up from it and realised that I was skinny, on the verge of unhealthy. 

Slowly after that I gained weight back. It's 5 years later and I can feel myself slipping back into it. I started on a diet and I'm just obsessed with exercising and I HATE eating. I feel guilty and I seek the pleasure of people saying you've lost so much weight'

When I've told people about my feelings, they tell me it's normal. I just don't know how to be healthy without under or/overeating. I find it really hard to do either.

I know atypical anorexia nervosa is a diagnosis, but I've only heard of it in the context of the weight loss aspect being unmet.

Disordered,"help  So, i’ve struggled on and off with ed for a few years now. Last night i found out my bf is into feeding and it triggered me so bad and now i just really wanna fall into old habits. Am i wrong for this? I just don’t know what to do"
Disordered,"how to go all in?  I have 0 support and self recovery hasn't been working, I keep relapsing back into fasting and these thoughts, thoughts that haunt me. idk what to do, how can one fix the way their brain works?"
Disordered,"I don't know how to handle this (your thoughts, please) kinda long, sorry  Before Covid, I was in recovery for a really long time, things were going really well, then..... Covid hit and I've been stuck in my apartment alone for over two years.  Well, when you lock an anorexic (even one who's in recovery) up alone for two whole years and nobody ever sees what they eat or what they weigh... guess what happens?  Yeah, you know, relapse.  A very, very, bad relapse, I got to my lowest weight and BMI ever, to the point I got really scared about endangering my health.  Well, I'm still restricting, but I've worked really hard and have gotten my BMI up to where I'm not scared I'll have a heart attack tomorrow, only I've got another problem.  After Covid, I'm getting together with friends again and getting out and especially getting out to hear music (most of my friends are artists or musicians) and in May I started getting together with one old friend, and he said, ""Come on over to my apartment, I'll make dinner, and we'll hang out and talk.""   TRIGGER TRIGGER TRIGGER!  Now over the years, I hid my ED from everybody because I felt so ashamed of it and always gave them the usual bullshit about how I had a high metabolism and I'm just naturally skinny, etc. etc.  But in May, I had to break down and  fess up to this friend, because I was still not in recovery enough to eat in front of him, I told him all about my ED.  So he said, ""That's okay, I'll just eat before you come over and I'll wash the dishes and everything because I don't want to upset you or anything.""  Now, I don't know if you know this about guys, but they NEVER want to talk about feelings or emotional problems or especially about things like an ED.  So neither he or I have mentioned my ED since that talk.  We have plans to go out to hear some music Friday and... I don't know if I should suggest to him that we go out and eat beforehand.   We always used to do that.  I think maybe I could eat something like a salad, I don't know.  l have so much shame about my ED that I really feel so much shame and regret about even telling him about it and I hate bringing it up again.  But I also don't want to go through life not eating around my friends, that would feel like such a loss to me.  I don't know what to do.  Any feedback you guys could give me would be welcome.  Don't worry about triggering me, say anything you want.  Thank you guys so much, you guys are great, I feel so much love and compassion in what you comment to people."
Recovery,"dating leading to a big step in recovery  i have already started taking small steps in recovery by hiring a therapist and coming clean about my anorexia however, i've met someone special who happens to be a personal trainer. last night, i accepted his offer to create a strength training plan for me which consists of 4 days/week in the gym. the goal is to build muscle and shape which as we know, must incorporate more food. i am a previous D1 athlete, so i am not anxious about the workouts but i know i need to fuel properly to get results and make it through each workout. i've started my day by adding collagen to my coffee (10G protein) and will meal prep my supper shortly. i know this will be extremely challenging and difficult as my ED voice will continue, but i'm also excited for new beginnings. my hope is to enjoy cooking and eating again as i used to. i am grateful for this safe space to share my thoughts and journey xo"
Recovery,"Do I hate sex because of anorexia? (EDITED)  

Hi everyone. The title may be strange so let me get it straight.

I have been diagnosed with anorexia when I was still a child so... puberty fucked up at the real start.
I still don't have regular period, besides an amazing osteoporosis which makes me waiting for medical appointments sitting next to 60-70 old ladies. 
And they don't know THEY are the amateurs, because my bones are classified as 80-90 old women's ones would ;)

Jokes aside, my body is pretty fucked up, physiologically speaking. Consequences of not eating enough and balanced are here to see and likely not to be solved soon.


I won't go into details about the reasons this topic came to my mind because it involves also another person, but the fact is that I have never felt sexual desires. 
The idea of sex never comes to my mind, and even if I feel (and I swear, I have felt this one) when I'm in love or attracted to someone, thinking of doing things with him isn't really a thing for me. I don't feel it necessary. It's kind of repulsing to me. 
I feel like I am sort of far far faaar away from that sphere. 

This btw doesn't include hugs, holding hands, kisses, staying in bed only in underwear, but when it comes to touching some ""parts of the body""... I really start to feel uncomfortable. I can say I hate it.

Times ago I thought I was into the spectre of being asexual, but afterhsome deep thinking about this... Well. 


My question is: do lack of hormones influence sexual desire? Is it scientifically explainable? Has anyone experienced the same thing?"
Disordered,Worrying over food is ruining my vacation  instead of thinking what I want to do all I can think of is the calories my meals had. I hate it. I don’t know what to do and it’s driving me crazy. My brother is with me he doesn’t know I have an ed and I‘ce been trying to act normal but it’s so fucking hard. The guilt ruined yesterday completely and maybe it will ruin today too. All I want is burn of calories…
Recovery,"advice on helping a partner with an ED  I felt like making this post to help those who are in relationships with someone with an ED, but anorexia specifically. I feel like the luckiest person alive to be in a relationship with the my partner, they're so good with helping me. This will kinda all be based of what they do for me. Also I just wanna celebrate how nice they are to me, hope you all don't mind.

Also I am nearing the end of my recovery but I am still unwell, it's just some extra support from them that helps, if I was very unwell a lot of this stuff would anger me and wouldn't help. Please bare that in mind. 

1) kinda obvious, no diet talk, no food talk, no fitness talk. Don't talk about steps, c*lories, nutrition and so on. It's not helpful and will make them very uncomfortable. Casual conversation like I want to go to the gym to get stronger is ok, but things like I wanna lose weight aren't ok.

2) When taking them out to restaurants avoid all vegan and veggies places as many use those lifestyles to restrict. Also in the UK since the new c*lorie rule on menu, try for small local business* to avoid this or look online or ask in the restaurant for calorie free menus. If you're in a situation where youve got to have a menu with c*lories, offer to read out the menu or take a photo of the menu with the information covered.
*if the company has less than 250 employees they don't have to show the information

3) use a sharpie to remove nutritional information from food you buy, or remove the packaging. Multipacks are good as the individual pieces inside don't have any of this info most the time. Also it's worth carrying one around.

4) positive reinforcement of good actions. Don't go over the top and wait until they've fully finished what they're doing and out of the situation else it might be triggering. Simple things like I'm proud of you, you've done really well and well done are great to hear.

5) ask how to support them in times of distress when you're with them. My partner will lie on top of me and cuddle me when I feel bad after eating. Its the most kind and amazing thing they do, and everytime they do it, it helps so much. When you're doing what you're doing for them, focus on calming, distraction and comfort. Don't talk about what's wrong, it'll make it worse as it can retrigger someone.

6) when youre not with them and you're texting, unless you feel overwhelmed, just listen to them vent. Sometimes all someone needs is to tell someone the thoughts in their head, have some reassurance or just be listened to and it helps a lot. But put yourself first, if you can't cope, let them know it's a bad time.

7) set an example. Anaylis your relationship with food. Do you restrict, do you have a bad relationship with food. If yes, work on that immediately and do not show that to them. I find copying what my partner eats and dos a really helpful way to improve myself. If theyre getting an ice cream I'll get it. If they're eating a challenge food of mine I'll ask to eat a bit of theirs or get my own. If they're not exercising today, then I don't need to ever. All you need to do is eat like normal basically. 

8)gently encourage three snacks and three meals. Just question them around those times of day. Have had youre snack yet? Are you hungry? Do you wanna get some food? X looks good, we should get some. Don't force it, don't be relate it to recovery, just know what they need to eat and generally encourage it

9) know when it's too much. You are the most important person to you, if you aren't coping with them being unwell, then get support yourself or leave. If you take anything away from this post, it's that you can not fix them. You can't take away their suffering. You can't make them recover. Anorexia will turn them into a vile person when challenged. If you can't cope with being around their illness, leave. When dating a person with an ED, you can't ignore it or pretend it doesn't exist, and asking them to hide it or keep it away from you is dangerous for them. There's no shame in saying you can't cope, it's better for both of you to be honest and open.

I can't be bothered to write full paragraphs about this but here's the rest of it.

No weight related complements. Don't tell them they're skinny and don't tell them they're not fat, it's what the ED wants to hear. Tell them they're pretty, have a lovely body or you wouldn't change anything about them (only say that if they're weight restored and don't need to gain more.)

Cook meals with them and do food shopping with them. Very good if you're at uni with ur partner.

Call out ED behaviour when you see it but be kind and gentle. Prepare for lying and anger, if you get this, don't push them, just leave it. 

Hope this helps people :)"
Disordered,How to stop caring about body image  im in recovery right now and i really want to be able to eat more food and show my parents that i’m getting better in recovery but i am so afraid of my body getting bigger and looking fatter than normal. I’m short which makes me think that my body looks fat and I really want to know how i’m able to overcome this fear of not caring about my body and being able to eat more
Disordered,hunger  does it mean i havent eat enough if my stomach is still hungry
Disordered,"Anyone else have this problem?  I basically can’t stand for more than a few minutes without feeling like I’m going to puke. I’m also very woozy anytime I get up or sit up straight. I literally haven’t showered in two weeks because I’ve been totally bedridden, only getting up to pee once or twice a day. I’ve been bedridden for a couple months but it’s only recently that I can’t even manage to take a bath with how woozy I feel. I’m not fasting but I have been severely restricting due to some stomach issues (potentially gastritis) and emetophobia."
Disordered,"Unsolicited message re. ""pro-anorexcia"" sub  Someone slid into my DM's as a ""moderator"" for a gross new sub. What's more, they complained to me about this sub. I have zero problems with this sub, so this is hugely problematic.

How gross. Please report any pro-ana subs, like the new ""pro-anorexcia"" sub which is obviously spelled wrong to get past a Reddit ban.

Disordered,the scale 🥲  i weighed myself this morning and it went up which made no sense :( what does this mean
Disordered,"Low weight and persistant low-grade fever?  So, I've been at this (under) weight before, and back then I was freezing all the time. 

This time around, I keep being really hot. I'll feel feverish, take my temperature, and it'll frequently ranges between 99.6 - 101.1 F. Even at a healthy weight, my temperature tended to be around 97.6 - 98.2. Even in summer.

This has been going on for two or three weeks now. Ocassionally I'll take my temperature and it will be normal, but incredibly frequently it's in the low grade fever territory. I've taken a couple covid tests that have been negative, and don't have any other symptoms other than feeling fatigued, lowkey nauseous, dizzy, and again, feeling feverish and hot to the touch. Also, while I've been trying to eat more and put on weight, this has been absolutely killing my appetite. I don't know what to think, it's weird and kind of irksome."
Disordered,"any ED discords?  Im not close with my family despite literally living with my dad, and I have zero people to hang out with since I moved to a new state and have yet to make a single friend. So basically I'm lonely af, and see no point in recovering, because... For what? For who? I have no one in my life anyway. So I think a group would be good for me. (I don't get  'triggered' so a super in depth one would be fine for me!)"
Recovery,"Reasons to recover?  What are the pros of recovery? I want to remind myself (and others here) every time I want to relapse that it’s worth it. Ones that I got so far:

Healthy hair, 
Not fainting when getting up, 
Eating whatever you want! 
Healthier skin, 
Stronger nails,"
Recovery,"Second time recovery  So I’ve noticed the first time I attempted recovery, prior to it and at my low weight I would get super hungry, have cravings, be very tired, etc. However I failed and am now starting recovery again at a lower weight than the first time HOWEVER this time I’m never hungry, no cravings/nothing sounds good, more energized. any idea why I’m feeling this way even tho weighing less?"
Recovery,"Body checking  How and when will it end? I cover up mirrors religiously, don’t walk across a street with a window straight opposite, and rarely take pics of myself. Still, I look at myself compulsively/impulsively at every other opportunity. Part of my body checking is to reassure myself, but usually it’s to ‘motivate’ me to lose more. I upset myself so much since I can’t separate mirrors/reflections/photos from my ED mindset ."
Disordered,"I'm scared I'll fall back into old habits  I've been anorexic for a year and a half, and a year of that was also bulimia, which I'm so scared I'll fall back into. I'm glad it happened, because now I know to never do it again, but I get upset whenever anyone talks about pur*ing because of the fact I'm so scared that I'll start again. I'm almost 6 months clean and it's becoming one of my biggest fears to relapse. :("
Disordered,"TW: I’m relapsing after gaining a lot in just two week, and I don’t know how to cope…  TW: mentions of weight gain/relapse and restrictive behavior 

The outpatient clinic I go to have been closed since it’s summer vacation. I usually get weighted once a week by my therapist, and it’s always the same scale that is being used. I’ve been getting weighed every week since late fall last year. And I’ve been in and out of recovery. 

However, I’ve relapsed quite badly now. I decided to weigh myself on monday and today. And in just under two weeks, I’ve gained almost 9 lbs. This has sent me into full panic-mode, because I don’t realize why I’ve gained that amount of weight in a short period of time. I wasn’t even underweight two weeks ago, which makes the  weight gain so much harder to deal with. Also, for the past two weeks I haven’t been eating according to my meal plan, and I’ve been walking 10-15k steps every day. That’s why I don’t understand how I’ve gained so much weight.

I have thrown out almost every single item of food from my freezer, refrigerator and cupboards, and I’ve decided to eat as little as possible until the outpatient facility opens again. Hopefully I’ll get some weight of before I’m seeing my therapist again. I fear that I won’t be able to lose any weight, and that I’m just going to continue gaining and gaining no matter what. 

I don’t believe that this relapse is going to make me lose a lot of weight, and I certainly don’t believe that I’ll be able to become underweight again. But how do I prevent myself from getting to that stage when I’m already so determined to lose the weight I’ve gained? I feel disgusted when I look at myself in the mirror, I can both feel and see how much my body has changed in just two weeks…."
Disordered,"still not over not being skinny after 4 years of trying  I'm so fed up. I've been in recovery since 2018 and I'm still not over the fact my body isn't what I want it to be.
I just wish I was in a smaller body. I used to think I wanted it because no one would love me and I'd be unattractive, but clearly that wasn't it because I currently have the most amazing partner. It's more down to what I want to look like and how I feel I'd look best. I want to present myself in a certain way, and I'll never be able to do that in my body.

I hate it. I wish I could be small and slim like my sister. Makes me feel my life is not worth living.

It's been 4 years. Why can't I get over this.

It's a choice between life and looks, and obvisouly I want life but it's such a hard fight."
Disordered,"Self Harm  Sometimes I see my thighs and they're just so large and fat, so I start punching them.

I guess I just want to hurt myself because I hate how fat I am and I can't stand my body."
Disordered,"Sex as a Coping Mechanism  This might sound weird, but sometimes I use sexual stuff to cope with my ed. Because if I can't get pleasure from eating or enjoy food as much as other people are able to, then at least I can get pleasure from that. And it can also distract me from the pain and hunger as well.

And yes, my sex drive is quite low a lot of the time, but once I get into it, it's really nice regardless. It feels a little embarrassing to talk about, but it's just something that helps me."
Disordered,Has therapy helped for anyone?  like sure he helps me connect the dots and theorize about WHY I am this messed up now but……. okay now what???? FIX MEEEEEE I just go in there and tell him how I’m getting scared bc i feel myself getting worse but also it feels good and he just looks at me with a concerned face and nods…… okkAAAAAAAYYYYY NOW WHAT… or like he wants me to get my primary care physician involved and a psychiatrist but all they’re gonna do is tell me to eat and I can’t do that rn and it would just be too much to deal with and feels like an overreaction bc I’m physically FINE still. anyways does therapy help anyone bc idk what I expect him to do but I wish he could do more
Disordered,angry all the time  I’m just angry. A l l the time. At everyone. For no reason. And I feel alone even though I have ppl that rly care about me. I guess that’s on me but I am too tired to care right now

Disordered,"still hungry! feels like the switch is broken, anyone else experience this?  TW (suicdl) It's been 5 years since starting recovery, there was a relapse maybe 2 years later and since then I would say I've been much more purge like. 
Since the last relapse I have become a lot less restrictive,; I lost control to it I started losing my hair and started drinking alcohol and then just started binging and since then have really struggled to eat right. I never feel full even when I'm in physical pain I still don't feel full, equally when I don't eat for a long time I will feel weak but not actually hungry, and then I'll start feeling that familiar evil high and feel scared, like there's a murder in the backseat while I'm driving. I've been struggling with drinking and drugs, and the effect they have over appetite and the laxative effects.
Even though I'm definitely a healthy weight I still feel famished, and so tired and dirty. I'm actually now more on the heavy side, with high BP. Some negative sexual experiences and the guilt of yoyoing has plunged my into another binge and into isolation in my home.
 In the past 2 years my weight has gone up and down drastically 
I'm scared my physical health can't take it but mentally I'm having very bad ideation thoughts as I fear the damage I keep doing to my body and the struggle to actually live a real life. 5 years ago It nearly killed me, it's killed my love life, life feels meaningless and like I'm failing when I'm not starving or living by food rules. I'm binging a bit but I can feel my anger rising and that I know it's one way or the other. I have no control over my relationship with food I'm either starving or binging I'm so exhausted from being this way all my life, all I think about is food my body and how much I hate them both.
Side note- my mum knows how much pain I go through especially when binging and I've seen her take joy in it, joy in my weight yoyoing my dad is similar and it breaks my heart. These yoyo periods are damaging my bones, heart and making me suicidal and they seem to find it amusing. 
Sorry went on a tangent... Does anybody else find their sense of hunger is totally off. Like hunger isn't a feeling but more a thought? I don't even know how to describe it.  Sorry if I've gone on a bit, if I could give it a second flair it would be rant. Thank you for reading."
Disordered,just got told i’m too fat to have an eating disorder 😻  aaaaaannnddd there goes my recovery attempt oh well goodbye guys 🤷🏻‍♀️
Disordered,Maybe if I was skinnier he'd like me.  I fucking hate myself.
Disordered,"guilt  i used to think that everyone experiences what i do when it came to food, but i’m coming to the realization that i’m having some serious problems. to put it plainly, i’ve been starving myself and having one small meal a day. me eating anything in the slightest gives me anxiety and guilt and i’ll think about it for the next two days. i wish i could eat without constantly feeling guilty afterwards. im so fucking jealous of people who can, but i can’t even stop at this point."
Disordered,"my mom intensifies my anorexia  (20f) i’ve been restricting my eating way too much. at this point i have only one meal a day and a TINY one at that. i had bulimia in high school, then had binge eating disorder my first semester of college, and now i think that i’m developing anorexia. the sad thing is, even though i constantly feel weak and eating makes me feel sick, it still feels so much better than me eating normally so i can’t stop doing it. i’ve lost 34 pounds since i started, and i keep losing weight faster and faster. i sometimes look at myself in the mirror and notice that i look better and i’m happy, and one time i told my mom that i was almost to my target weight. she then told me that i should try to lose another 30 pounds. when i was a kid, she named my stomach “anna” and told me “anna is showing” when i looked fat. it feels like my mom is making me worse and everytime i try to tell her she tells me i’m being dramatic. i just feel like i’m never gonna be happy about my weight because of the way my mom has affected me over the years. i can’t see myself recovering from this if i don’t gain acceptance from her and it’s pathetic."
Disordered,"anyone else miss the bad days?  i miss my anorexia. i technically still have it and im still purging, but now im in recovery and nowhere near as bad as i was in the past. i miss the bad days so much, they were like a nostalgic comfort to me. i become so used to that feeling that i wanted nothing else …and i still want nothing else. i just want to know if anyone feels the same."
Recovery,it’s so nice when u don’t feel guilty for eating  today my mom made my fav dinner (rice and beans and grilled chicken) and i almost always feel guilty abt eating but tonight i don’t! on top of that i’m excited abt dinner and i haven’t been excited to eat smth in a long time. not very often that i’m like this but i’m very proud of myself! just wanted to say this so yeah 😵‍💫🙌
Disordered,"just frustrated:,/  recently my mom has been just sending me articles on calories or certain diets that i should be doing or how i should be eating a certain amount each day:,( despite my conversations with her about how that stresses me out and isn’t as helpful as she may think, which i thought she was starting to understand but today she was telling me again how i should be eating “these certain meals” and how i’m gonna get sick but like… 😵‍💫i already am LOL. i just wish she would really listen or understand me a little more and realize how much just certain little words or articles can stress me out. i understand she just wants to be helpful but it just makes me feel sad"
Recovery,Recovery question  So I’m starting the recovery process but due to insurance and scheduling I won’t be able to see the psychiatrist and dietician that I made an appointment with until late September. I’m terrified of getting better because I don’t want to feel the way I used to feel about my body when I was heavier. How do I manage this? Is there anything I should start doing now to prepare for recovery? How do ya’ll cope with weight gain in recovery?
Recovery,"is this normal?  i’m in a/n recovery as of the last 6 months but when i was at my lowest i developed a problem with my blood sugar? i used to never have an issue with needles but now any time i get my blood taken or get a shot i get dizzy and/or faint which is understandable considering my low weight, but i’m at a normal weight now and i still have this problem, i still have chronic nausea and hunger pangs too. 

way back in 2017 i got my septum pierced and it went amazing! fast forward to 2021 i got my nostril pierced and fainted & puked everywhere. 
fast forward 6 weeks ago i got my vertical labret pierced and the pain itself wasn’t even bad but i stood up and had to sit back down because i was dizzy, i ended up projectile vomiting and i couldn’t hold my eyes open, i really felt like i was going into a seizure. my hands started to cramp up and i couldn’t move them, which also happens a lot when i throw up. is this normal? does anyone else experience this?"
Recovery,"will i put on weight  will i put on weight?

TW
so for the past 2 days I’ve been travelling and visiting my relatives, so I couldn’t restrict my food intake like I used to. with immense food guilt and anxiety and having a couple of breakdowns and panic attacks, i still ate a lot ( actually a LOT, more than normal sized portion ). i usually eat only half of that amount so having so much food (high calorie junk food), i keep replaying and recounting what and how much ate. I feel unusually and uncomfortably full and im freaking out that I’ve gained a lot of weight. will i put on weight bc of these couple of days or a week of overeating? I’m so so scared…i had pretty much no physical activity in those days ( I usually don’t exercise). I feel so tempted to purge but ik it’ll only make me feel worse. now that I’m home I can’t even skip dinner. can a week of eating more make you gain weight?"
Recovery,"Advise and support?  I’m a 14 year old girl with a low but healthy bmi. Recently I have been diagnosed with an eating disorder and have been forced into fbt treatment. I hate it and I am scared I will never be able to recover. Recovery isn’t something I want right now as I want to be able to love my body before being forced to gain/maintain weight. For background January 2022 to now I have lost quite a significant amount of weight but as I was overweight before I am still not underweight. I was eating eating extremely low cal to loose weight and lost stuff such as my period, my energy and temperature however I have never once been classed as underweight.

Yes, I have lost weight but I still look fat and no where near the body I want to be happy. I’m so scared and lost on what to do as I know I can’t get better In this body. I have no one to talk to or help me as my parents and all the treatment nurses treat me as if I’m some monster who doesn’t know what she’s talking about.

I haven’t had the same amount of energy “normies” have since I was 10 years old. Which also = the same amount of happiness. Yeah I’m underweight but everyday I obsess over Eugenia (iykyk) and knowing I’m not that and likely won’t be makes me not enjoy my skinniness and feel like a fraud and I eat “normally” on sundays but then have panic attacks all day about it. I’m still living with parents and starving is the only way to cope (that’s why I do SW so I can move out soon!) and I’ve been so sick and underweight since I was 10/11ish and my dad used to call me retarded for it or a skank or an ugly bag of bones and so many other things Now he just says nothing and pretends it not there. Never once had the “it’s ok and I love you and we’ll help” talk with either of my parents, my mom also pretends it’s not there. I could have such a good life if I let it go but I also don’t know how to live without the safety of it. I can’t afford help, as every dime I make is going towards saving or essentials for living.

But my appetite was low and I ate what my body told me to, so I was nauseous eating more and sometimes vomited. 

Still today if I think about food that doesn’t intrigue I get nauseous. If I eat too much I get nauseous. If I haven’t eaten I feel nauseous.

Recently I’ve lost my appetite and I’ve had trouble regaining it when I feel sick and sometimes even throw up around eating. Now I’m slowly losing weight. 

Has anyone else who ate so much food to the point of vomiting deals with nausea years later and what do you recommend?

Thanks!"
Disordered,Advice for facing fear foods  Hi everyone hope everything is going okay. I meant with my dietitian today and I am suppose to start facing fear foods. These next 2 weeks I decided I would do macaroni. I haven’t had this in who knows how long. Does anyone have advice for facing fear foods and/or what you do after facing them. Thank you for reading!
Disordered,"i thought i developed my old anorexia into a bulimia but i think im still anorexic. someone tell me..?  my old 2 years of anorexia, i never once binged. ever. even overeaten. i was always restricting and over exercising. then i got into my binge eating disorder for about 7 months. after i started purging everything which is bulimic but when i don’t binge i’d eat something even tho it was still not normal eating. and now i binge and purge almost daily but after that, i eat nothing at all. i restrict liquids and water too. except the time i b/p, i consume absolutely nothing except nicotine. i usually fast for min 16hrs to 50 hrs. then i b/p again then fast and repeat.

someone said if u restrict more than you consume by binging its anorexia with b/p. im not sure if im anorexic anymore tho because of the first 2yrs of my ed where i never ever ate til i felt full. my head hurts lol"
Disordered,Recovery makes things worse?  I am a 14 year old girl who’s recently been diagnosed with an ‘eating disorder’. I’ve just been forced into fbt and made to stop weight gain even though I am not classed as under weight. The people at the eating disorder clinic seem to be avoiding giving me a real diagnosis however are forcing me to recover. Witch I know I cannot to right now. Why?
Disordered,"im a disappointment and i don’t know what else to do.  ive just come to the realisation that im a horrible fucking person and even though im over a year sober now i think im just going to starve myself again. it’s easier, i won’t have to spend any more money, it’ll help the animals or whatever, and a while ago my neighbour agreed to take care of my dog if and when i pass away before him so i don’t really see the problem with it but my friends are upset about it and i don’t think they understand. im stupid and if i could say the r slur here to describe myself as well id definitely also say that. point is i just don’t think i deserve anything. i don’t want to take food away from people who really need it but i don’t know how to keep people from noticing, especially since i live with other people. my only other worry is that im friends with some of the animals at my local zoo and im afraid they’ll wonder where i went or why i look different since i visit them often. will they notice?? am i putting too much faith in them?"
Disordered,"Therapist basically said I’m not anorexic and I’m fine  The session went for a dark turn. It was great up until he started talking about how when he first started working with me, he thought I was going to be on the verge of hospitalization and anorexic but the more he looked at the DSM, he realized that I’m fine. My heart sank and I told him well that is exactly the problem, I told him how much that triggered me. How THATS the problem with diagnosis and that’s basically why I want to get to a very underweight weight. Told him how I wear baggy clothes in our sessions (which are virtual) so he can’t see my body. I told him I might not be very underweight but I might be on the cusp of underweight and now it’s just reinforced me to want to lose more fat. The obsession and compulsion is already there, so now it’s just even stronger.  Our session was longer than usual because I could tell he was worried about me and he said I’m sorry if I triggered you, you going to be okay? He said I could email him if i needed to process anything. He’s a great therapist but I really just think he didn’t think what he said would trigger me like that. I straight up told him yea, this is why my Ed is still here and alive. Maybe if I lost 15 lbs then maybe my mom would be concerned or maybe people would take me seriously and be worried. But since I “look fine” and “healthy” and muscular, I guess it’s fine. I can keep starving myself and keep trying to lose weight so I’m legitimately underweight. I’m so upset"
Disordered,"I don't want to open up about my eating disorder to my loved ones  I'm just not comfortable with it. Every time they ask me questions they end up saying something extremely triggering or borderline offensive and it becomes a literal job or a task to communicate regarding my Ed.

They also then said that ""every time I try to ask you stuff you just push me away"" and it's like...yeah I do that because I don't wanna hear ""why don't you just stop starving it's not good for you"" for the millionth time

It's exhausting having to communicate and it's even more tiring when they get mad at me for not opening up. I genuinely don't have the patience in me to talk to them about this even tho I went into detail like 5 times already in the past month of so and every single time I get so fucking disoriented and appalled. 

I feel guilty because they just wanna know about it but they're pushing recovery on me as well and getting upset when I'm unable to go through it. I hate this because I love them but they're so fucking irritating.

Im genuinely becoming such an insufferable person because of my eating disorder it's not fair to the people I love."
Disordered,"I feel so alone  Im desperate its like that bitch has become everything I know and has fully occupied me, made me her slave.I try to recover but its like she is having control over me physically and i generaly cant eat like a person  how am I supposed to recover I want to I really do but I am so powerless. How do I help myself where do I start. My psychiatrist is out of town even if she were here i doubt she would have helped me.I think i would eat now but its like a mechanical reaction to either spit my food or throw it away.I used to have the thoughts and either choose to follow them or try not to now I dont get a saying anymore. I am so so sorry to come here with all this negativity I just have nowhere else to go noone else to turn to.My brain is litterly melted.She is messing with me so badly making me see her like a fucking goddess when shes notning but a liar. How can she have made me think I want her, Im nothing wothout her I know that isnt true yet I dont know how to fight anymore"
Disordered,"why do I feel like I'm fuckin dying when I eat normal or ""too much""  (I'm not in recovery)

TW for self harm, calories, fasting, n all the typical ana shit. I'm bein blunt here.


I'm not at a plateau, I still lose weight when I fast or restrict. whenever I eat more, my whole body hurts so much I can't burn it off with exercise bc I dont even wanna move, I get bad headaches I never get when I restrict, I have no energy. I get more intrusive thoughts about suicide, cutting, making myself OD. not bc of self hate, even if I'm not thinking about how much I ate I just feel awful physically and mentally.

but when I dont eat/barley eat I feel completely fine and actually pretty happy. I get lightheaded or faint or feel like I will but it feels so good to me. feeling my stomach growl and shrink doesn't hurt, it feels like being high.

but back to my question. has my body just gotten used to it? why do I feel so sick when I eat and not when I'm actually sick?"
Recovery,"Is it just me or is being called fat more hurtful when people knew you as thin?  Recovered and it all went downhill from there. I have very limited resources and since I was expelled from university, I no longer had insurance so I was on my own.

My anorexia probably morphed into binge eating (sometimes with laxative abuse, but I think I'm more of a binger than a bulimic). 

My sister had a baby shower for their beautiful baby girl. Everyone there almost did not recognise me. I don't think I would have minded being told I became thick or look healthy, but people were outright rude to me. My grandma was like 'you went from *makes a stick figure gesture* to that *makes a fat person gesture* in no time! Wow.' I felt humiliated and judged by everyone there and I didn't see my family or leave my room since. 

I've been triggered and I don't know how to handle my emotions without restriction. Not that I'll be able to restrict because I completely lost my willpower too. Like, the painful thing is that people see me as genuinely fat, not just thick or healthy. It's my own fault for indulging into this reactive hunger and making myself overweight. 

I'm sad."
Recovery,"To those that are in recovery/ recovered and on this subreddit:  Hello!! First of all AMAZING i’m proud of u!! Second of all, genuine question, what do u guys gain from this subreddit? How is it not triggering and why do u like coming on here?"
Recovery,"Does anyone else have no sex drive even after recovery?  My eating disorder started at a young age (around 14-15 y.o) and I have never been sexually active or desired to have sex. Maybe I’m just asexual because even after I began recovering 2 years ago, I am now 19 and have no sex drive whatsoever."
Recovery,"Does anyone else feel this way?  I developed an eating disorder at a very young age before I was able to develop properly and it just feel horrible knowing that I will never be pretty and curvy like  the other girls in my school and my friends,I'd like to know if anyone else feels this way or if anyone has any tips in being able to reverse the damage that I done if that's even possible."
Disordered,Went on a week spree of eating normally or extra but also a lot more exercise and I’m worried that when I get home I’ll weigh too much.  I work at a summer camp which provides meals and I’ve been eating a full meal every day and often going up for seconds. Someone made a comment that I’m lighter than someone next to me who is only just slightly shorter and I’m worried that I gained too much weight. What do I do
Disordered,"i'm in distress (tw suicidal thoughts)  help, juste help me for god sake, i have suicidal thoughts right now because i binged, why can't i fucking eat anything without ending binging? i hate myself so much when i'm not empty, how can i see fat adding under my skin after i eat? why does it start with a vegetable and end with 3 entire boxes of cookies, why does it have to be so cruel, i'm done, i'm just done, i want it to end right now, i want to fall asleep and just stop thinking or i'm going to go crazy, i need to stop thinking right now, i need it all to end right now, help me, please, anything, anyone"
Disordered,"I should be scared that i’m getting worse, but it feels good?  I know that’s the twistedness of this disorder, but what in the world… It’s ACTUALLY getting harder to eat (even when I know I’d still be in a big deficit if I ate more, it just never feels “worth it”), and I say actually in all caps because usually it’s more of an “effort” to restrict if that makes sense? Like of course normally I ALWAYS would love to eat more or even binge bc I’m hungry duh but then thinking about the dread and anxiety of the aftermath makes me not do it, but lately the thought of eating more is ONLY and immediately terrifying and full of dread that it kills the urge altogether. There was a part of my brain that was afraid that I felt myself getting worse not long ago, but now that part is getting quieter. I feel like I should be terrified of where I’ve gotten to and where i’m headed but… it feels good and my constant lightheadedness/disassociation numbs out some of my INTENSE ass social anxiety and anxiety of being perceived at all, and it even feels euphoric at times. I’m almost proud that I’ve gotten here, bc normally it made me jealous to read about how people just “CANT” eat more bc I always felt like I COULD I just forced myself not to. Part of my brain is definitely scared right now, but it’s quieter. I just felt like I needed to share, thanks for reading if u did."
Recovery,"feeling like i wanna relapse  i’ve always struggled with believing i have an ED bc even as my smallest, i still looked “healthy”. about two years ago is when it got really bad. i lost weight quickly and by the end of the summer i had lost a significant amount of weight. i ended up having a mental breakdown the following spring and ended up in therapy for awhile. i haven’t been going for the last year bc i’ve felt better, but i’ve gained a lot of the weight back and i’ve been binge eating lately and feeling really bad about myself.  i’m having a hard time not looking back at old pictures of me and thinking how easy it was for me to fall into those habits and i’m angry at myself for not wanting to do it again. i’m just really struggling with my body right now and don’t really have anyone to talk to about it."
Recovery,"When should I seek help?  Hello, I 21F have quickly realized that all of my panic attacks I have over eating food, being ashamed of how much I eat/what I eat isn’t just my general anxiety. I’ve lost an excessive amount of weight in a very short amount of time to where I get dizzy spells and passed out at work at my new job. This keeps happening and my BP tanks out of nowhere with no activity. When should I seek help? I can’t keep going how I am, it’s exhausting and I’m tired of feeling this way.

Recovery,"Is the thermic effect of food really a thing?  I'm freaking out.

Hating full blown recovery so trying harm reduction.

Been managing to stick to a limit I still detest but is higher than when I'm fully restricting and giving in to the voice. 

Got super hungry this afternoon and could not work or focus on anything. 

Spent ages on Deliveroo on various pages adding things to basket I knew I'd never order - pizza, etc - finally settled on two protein bars.

I'm now way over my daily limit and I'll be having dinner too (otherwise the night time reactive hunger just causes such massive binges it's not worth trying to skip dinner)

I'm trying to reassure myself with the whole, protein is harder to digest, uses more energy etc...

Is that... Is that really a thing? Or diet culture bullshit?

Man I am struggling and feel so greedy and disgusting.

I keep thinking I should've just had fruits or veggies but it wouldn't fill me up. All those classic diet culture things of 'fill up on veggies to curb hunger!' just... Don't work for me after five years of anorexia.

It all feels worse cause I'm not doing any exercise at the moment due to some other health issues and exercise always helped me feel more justified in eating so now I just feel like a disgusting greedy horrible person and I know I'll gain more weight if I carry on like this.

Aaarrrrgghhh. Food. Why. Just why. I hate food."
Disordered,"Reaching my low weight didn't give me the rush I thought I would get  It lasted for about a day but I immediately fell into a depressive slump. I'm starting to feel like this disorder isn't worth it anymore and I just wasted like 5 years of my life for nothing.

Only 2 people commented on my weightloss and no one is especially concerned or loves me more like I thought would happen. 

I also still feel fat and feel like I need to lose more despite being (barely) in the severely underweight range. I'm generally not interested in anything, im pissed off, I'm keeping myself devoid of a healthy life and mind and I have constant brain fog. All of which I was prepared for and had been dealing with for a while but it doesn't feel worth it to me.

I don't feel the euphoric rush I was told I would feel, mostly by my own brain. I'm genuinely miserable and realizing it for the first time in this time I've had my eating disorder. It's still comforting to me but only because it's familiar. 

Im still possessive over my Ed though despite feeling it's misery to the full extent."
Disordered,"i can’t rest - giving myself burnout HELP TW  4 years ago ive had an exercise addiction (was hitting the gym 4-5h every day). i’ve started recovery and stopped going to the gym but started to go on very long walks (even though i was exhausted). i’ve got addicted to drugs 2 years ago and finally was able to rest (physically and mentally) but yeah you can imagine; it wasn’t very healthy and i had to stop drugs. it’s been a few months without drugs but since i’ve stopped i relapsed very hard with restricting (because i was so afraid to gain without the appetite repressive affect of the drugs) and after i’ve had a few binges again i’ve tried to do sport again but i don’t feel better afterwards (even more worse) because im always thinking „i was hitting the gym 5h everyday and now im exhausted after 30mins…“

Now that I’m past that point of the year I’m working 5 days still walking 10-15 miles a day. I lost a decent amount in 3 months and now I’m curious about going lower, I hate the idea of putting the weight back on. Idk I just wanted to vent and talk about this, I don’t think anyone has really picked up on it yet. I’m burning about 2x the calories I can eat in a day and i know it’s unsustainable but.

As soon as I saw my newer size, I feel so panicked and all I can now do is obsesse about my size and how big I am. I even stepped on a scale, I haven't done that in a long time. 

My partner isn't sure how to deal with this and doesn't want to get into it. During my pregnancy and after baby, it was rough. He would make comments like "" I like the way you look, but if you are unhappy with yourself then change it."" He doesn't get it.

Disordered,"Prolonged GI issues after anorexia recovery?  Hi all! This is the first time I’ve ever posted in this sub in the hopes that maybe some others have had similar experiences.

I’ve been physically recovered from anorexia for about 8-9 years now, but I’ve pretty much always had GI issues following my recovery. At first I thought it was just a normal response to my body trying to function normally again after the damage I had done to it, but I’ve continued to have pretty severe bouts of GI problems even now when I’ve been physically healthy for an extended period of time.

Mainly I’m constantly gassy after eating (burping A LOT after every meal, pretty severe bloating) and I’ve had a consistent problem with constipation regardless of my diet/exercise levels. Recently I’ve been going 10-12 days without having a bowel movement which is obviously EXTREMELY uncomfortable and the only thing that really helps is laxatives at that point, which I hate taking because of how rough they are on your stomach.

I’ve been to primary care doctor and my labs have come back normal (no issues with my thyroid is what they were mainly considering) and I still have no answers. Since I’ve been dealing with these issues for so long I’m kind of used to it but at the same time, if it’s something I can fix, I would love to be able to live more comfortably. The only explanation that I can think of at this point since a lot of these issues first began when I was in recovery is that all of my GI issues are related to what I did to my body when I was at my sickest. So my question to you all is: has anyone else had a similar experience?"
Disordered,"Customers can sometimes be ‘triggering’  I work in customer service at a local restaurant and I love it. In a way, I feel like working in the restaurant industry has helped my eating disorder because I am surrounded by people who have come to enjoy food and socialize. 
However, some customers that I engage with obviously don’t have a good relationship with food and that can be both saddening and triggering. I’ve had customers ask me if they can look at the nutrition labels on the products we use. Others times, customers will make comments about a certain food having “too many calories”. 
I’m starting to get used to it but it’s even harder when it’s someone my age because I start to see myself in them and I feel horrible."

Like there’s a TON of foods I would never eat even a bite of because it would feel like a “waste of calories” and isn’t worth it, or certain foods like any pastry or cake i Will EXTRA EXTRA overestimate the calories for even a tiny piece…. But I’m still gonna eat that tiny piece bc that kind of stuff is worth it sometimes. and I would never eat anything cooked in oil bc “not worth it” but I WILL shave off a tiny piece of butter and mix it with a bit of Splenda and savor those moments of bliss bc that’s worth it…  but my point is I’m not like “afraid” of food? I just don’t WANT to eat them or I won’t eat them. Like if for some reason somehow I was FORCED to eat fried rice cooked in oil… I would have a meltdown and be so fucking angry and distressed and feel gross and cry but bc i wouldnt WANT to “spend” any calories on that. it just doesn’t feel or look at all like how i see people on the internet interacting with their “fear foods”. Like if i ate a yummy big cookie for some reason, i’d feel super guilty and stressed about eating that amount of calories, but i like the food, i’m not afraid of it? Is this just me?

Disordered,"Binging in recovery  Heyy I’m truly confused about this. I don’t recognise when I’m hungry or not and what is physical and mental hunger. I’ve read some posts that some people in recovery slipped to binge eating disorder and I’m scared that’s my case too. 
I’m trying to eat more during the day but it’s really hard and I don’t have time for that so I end up eating more in the afternoon. But the problem is night eating. I have the mental urge to overeat at night. Some days I just binge a lot.
Do you have the same experience with this and if yes what helped you?
Is this due to the restriction that I’m not eating enough during the day?

Me and my fiance are both working on ourselves and supporting eachother because we want to be the best and healthiest we can be, but in what I believe is a healthy mindset. Neither of us are trying to ""fix"" each other, we just want the best for each other and have good motivators (beyond just us) to improve ourselves. I have finished my associates degree (after 7 years of never thinking I would be able to return to school) with high grades and will be returning this fall to finish my bachelor's degree, with master's degree next in line.

Yet I keep losing weight. I have gone and bought protein shake powder so I at least have something easy to make and have. But I was really weird today and I know it was due to eating so little the past few days. And I keep meaning to eat more, and my fiance lovingly reminds me to eat more, and sometimes I genuinely think I am doing better. And then the number on the scale keeps dropping. I have all the motivation I could ask for to do better, yet here I am. 

Not to get into specfic numbers, bur if I lose anymore I will technically again be dropping from the ""severe"" to the ""extreme"" BMI category according to DSM (which I of course take with a grain of salt, but is something I keep in mind). 

I am at the point where I really don't think intensive could help me. I've done it so many times I don't think there's anything more I could really gain or learn from that. I basically feel ""okay"" as far as I go, moreso than I did it at similar weights when I was younger. Nobody around me is freaking out about my weight or anything. But I definitely don't feel great. And I'm really not actively trying to lose weight, but it keeps going down, and I just. I don't know what to do."
Recovery,"Getting better???  I think….I’m on my way to recovery. There’s been things I’ve been doing that are positive and on the right track towards being healthy. I’ve been eating a lot more. I’ve been trying my hardest to drink water but I have been drinking lots of Gatorade and juice. I’m in a program for my ED. And a little over a week after my birthday (beginning of august) I’ll be starting a long road trip to the other side of my state. It’s for a residential home. I was reading all the packets and PDFs from an email they sent and I got familiar with how the program and home works. I got excited but then anxious. I had a panic attack and my breathing wasn’t good. I just got very overwhelmed and was feeling a lot of emotions. I’m still really excited because this program is kind of exactly what I need right now. Overall I’m nervous about everything, but I’m also eager to go."
Disordered,"i don’t even know anymore  ok so i don’t know if i’m actually anorexic per say but i certainly know there’s something wrong with me. i know i don’t Need to be doing any of this, i mean i’m naturally skinny, but to me it’s never enough. i make myself not eat, i feel guilty when i eat, i started becomes obsessed with calories and drinking exclusively water but so that it’ll fill me up and i won’t eat as much. i’m always walking or something and i get anxious if i don’t burn “enough” calories in one day. i know it’s all in my head but i can’t stop. i never weigh myself though because we don’t have a scale and not being able to see a number is always on the back of my mind. i always think about what if i gained weight? stuff like that. i just needed to get this out."
Disordered,"It’s so hard  I went to dinner with some friends and I ate a small amount..after not eating all day-which I did strategically so my friends wouldn’t say anything. Well the minute I took a bite a friend said “wow you’re eating!” And I know she meant it in a supportive way, but why did I instantly feel regret and shame because I was eating??? It’s so annoying. Because she said that comment I didn’t even end up finishing my food- because in a weird way I didn’t want them to look at me as someone who doesn’t restrict calories? Idk. It’s like I don’t want ppl to talk about my ED but I also don’t want people to forget that I have one..I’m rambling at this point idk if any of you can relate?"

Disordered,"ahh fuck it  I just realized why im not fucking happy, and im not going to be happy. My survival skills are worse than a fucking 5 year old. a 5 year old would get themself some chips, or cereal, and move on with their life. I waste thousands of calories of resources basically fucking gargling my food, food that many people aren't lucky enough to have, but i waste because im so fucking pathetic, and for what? does it make me happy to purge? no. does it make me happy to starve? no. does it make me happy to lose weight? no, it fucking doesnt. this fucking bullshit doesnt make me happy.  the only thing that makes me happy now is being high as fuck. 

i am never going to be happy again with myself. Not like this. it just isn't fucking possible. my brain is a delicate machine, and i threw a fucking wrench into it, I haven't bothered putting fuel in it for years, and now i expect it to produce the right chemicals? and every day i go to therapy and complain about it. there is a reason im not fucking happy.  I keep wondering why it isn't working, when it is me that keeps denying my brain the fuel that it desperately needs, that it has been screaming at me to get. and i complain about it all the fucking time, when it is my fault entirely. it is me that keeps fucking gargling the fuel that would actually make me happy. how stupid can i actually fucking be? 

the world is an amazing place, and i have wasted all my time that I could be seeing it gargling my food. fuck this. fuck it. this isn't making me fucking happy, it's fucking boring, and fucking pathetic. this isn't doing anything for me and I need to shut the fuck up and just fucking eat instead of whine and complain about being sad, when i could easily get rid of all my problems by just nourishing my body.

Recovery,"Dating Normal/Fat and Anorexic  Hello, sorry for my imperfect english.
I'm not an eating disorder (rather a few pounds overweight), but I'm dating a woman with anorexia (for 15 years, but she goes to a therapist regularly).  I sometimes have the feeling that I'm doing everything wrong or that I'm just stupid.  I flirt with her, she flirts back, but sometimes I have the feeling that she doesn't care, it's just the calories and the food that matter, where she also criticizes my overweight.  Would it be wrong/stupid to take her out for ice cream or give her candy for a date?  Please enlighten me.  Or am I just stupid and the eating disorder has no role for dates and a hoped-for relationship?"
Recovery,"worried about a friend, need advice  I’ve never visited this subreddit so please tell me if I don’t comply to rules or anything.
I have a good friend who used to be very overweight and unhealthy. Smoked and drank every day, never exercised, ate almost exclusively fastfood. I just saw in the rules I can't post weights but he was very heavy.
One day he decided this was not the life he wanted and started to get his live around. Stopped smoking, barely drank any alcohol. Walked about (many) kilometers every day for a year and about a year later started running. Very strict dietary intake.  Lost a great amount of weight, but it did come with a few downsides. He’s very focused on keeping control of everything in his life. He often cancels social events last minutes because they can cost him a lot of energy. When he does go they can tire him out for a week straight. 
Recently he told his girlfriend (who’s very supportive) that ‘if we keep this up for another year we’ll be slim finally!’ The thing is, he already lost like  XX kg in the last two years. He is slim. 
This and his extreme control of his dietary intake has led me to believe he might be or become anorexic. I find it hard to tell if I’m maybe overreacting but I do think his view on his body is a distorted perception of weight. Can anyone clarify me on what I should think of the situation and wether I’m overreacting? Also in any case, what’s something I can do to help him? I do want to support him in his healthy lifestyle but I know his mental health is deteriorating as a result of his extreme need for control.
Thanks for reading!"
Disordered,"Catty clients.  So I’m working as a hairstylist at a VERY high end salon and I’ve been struggling with my eating a lot recently. I’ve lost a very noticeable amount of weight in a relatively short amount of time. For my clients, I’m sure this is jarring to see. However, a lot of them have been passive aggressive or downright mean towards me and my body. I’m hearing comments like “OMG what’s your secret to losing all that weight??? I’ll have what you’re having!” Or “So like, are you trying to lose weight on purpose?”. But the worst thing someone has said was probably “well I’m so glad your metabolism is finally working in your favor. You finally look how you’re supposed to look!”. 

Having an ED is hard enough and working in the beauty industry doesn’t make it any easier. Especially when my clients are prying into me for “diet” and “weight loss” tips. I’m exhausted physically and mentally. I really don’t know if I can continue on in this industry that I so dearly love. Fuck anorexia."

Disordered,"BMI qualifications are so dangerous  I remembered reading that u qualify for anorexia nervosa (not atypical) once u hit “x” BMI, and I weighed myself just now and calculated and saw I was just under that bmi now and felt really happy. Then I looked it up and oh my god. One website said that, but many others had charts of bmi ranges that said “severity of anorexia” and said “mild” “moderate” “severe” “extreme”. On this website I didn’t even fall under the “mild” category. As u can imagine I felt so invalidated and cried lol. Another website labeled their ranges “mild thinness” “moderate thinness” “severe thinness”. I fell under mild thinness. I can’t imagine how many people with this disorder use these fucking charts as a way to mark their goals like I’m doing now. This is so messed up man how can they not see how dangerous those charts are??"

Now, I have a diagnosis of AN B/P subtype AND STILL DONT FEEL VALID AT ALL. I don’t know why my head works like this, also I have been in recovery or semi recovery for the last month and a half and I am scared that I am not anorexic anymore (???)

Disordered,When did you first realize you were struggling?  I’ve (24f) recently started to come to the realization that my unhealthy habits in regards to restriction is tied to my appearance. I’ve struggled with food restriction as a way to cope with my depression/anxiety and I thought that was all it was. I don’t think I was ever conscious that there was more to it or maybe I’ve always known and just ignored it. I’ve been slowly realizing that I do obsess over how I look and long to be smaller. I long to take up less space. It makes me sad. I guess I just want hear others’ stories so I don’t feel alone.

Disordered,"How to help support an online friend with Anorexia  Hey guys. I was talking to a friend of mine recently who told me they had anorexia. They seemed fairly open about it, and when I asked them if they were interested in treatment, they said they couldn't get it because they are a young teenager and their mother doesn't support them getting therapy, and calls it a 'diet'. 

I asked them if they wanted encouragement or support, and they said yes. I've told them that they can talk to me anytime. At this point, is there anything I should do? 

Should I ask/remind them to eat, or would that put pressure on them? What are things I can say to them, not just when they come to me to vent, but even when they don't text me first, because I'm kind of worried that they won't talk to me about it as often as they want to.

I lost my period for two months last year

I started going to the gym and working out and i rlly like it

I cry over food all the time and really only eat a normal amount when my bf is home

I go to sleep when i get extreme hunger pains and then eat after i wake up and dont feel it anymore

When i restrict my chest hurts

I can go hours without eating but then i still end up eating a few times some times

 I have days where i have my bf turn the mirrors around because i cry after ive eaten and i weigh myself about 7 times a day
My biggest problem is that the doctors look at my height and weight and then they tell me im normal even though i lost a significant amount of weight in the past year. But i never became underweight.

Im constantly scared of going into my kitchen, idk i just feel like since everyone is acting like its not thst serious that i should commit to recovery and everyone is just telling me to eat."
Disordered,I need it to Stoppp  I need the EH to stop it’s so annoying being hungry all the time I’m not even at my gw and I’m having it it doesn’t make sense I’m not at my gw and idk if I’m supposed to even have EH bc I didn’t restrict for that long
Disordered,Fed up with people telling me to eat…  
Disordered,How do I admit this puts me in a seriously bad headspace without sounding even more toxic than I feel? I'm reminded again why I feel I don't deserve to eat.  
Disordered,"What in the actual fuck?  WHAT the fuck is going on. I have been restrictive for a while now, but since school has ended I am both restrictive to the point of walking in and out of the kitchen trying not to cry. When I DO eat I've begun purging, which I really hate but I feel thankful that I can do that if I have to. Why is this getting so bad??? Both my psychiatrist and counselor told me that I'm wasting everyone's time because I'm not willing to do the things they suggest (go inpatient or keep a healthy meal plan). I'm just... I don't know. I'm so fucking done."
Disordered,"So sick of the night eating  I don’t binge, I don’t even over eat. But at night I eat my OMAD and it works for me. I feel like I’m finally losing weight because yes, I am in my ED sorry if I’m not all recovery mode right now.  I’m just very sick of myself and the late night eating. I’ll even wake up in the middle of the night at like 4am and eat a nibble of something. This is fucked and it’s sabatoging my weight loss. For example, I’ll eat celery and mustard. Or lettuce and mustard. Or carrot and mustard. Last night I had a carrot and a piece of broccoli dipped in mustard and a small spoon of vegan cream cheese. It’s not a binge, but there is NO FUCKKNG REASON my body needs food at that hour. My body needs sleep at that hour. Not food. I am so fuckinf sick of myself. Why do I even go grocery shopping? I should just buy enough for one day at a time. I’m so frustrated and sick of this."
Disordered,"My therapist said something yesterday that left me utterly speechless  
I had stopped seeing her for almost three months due to my relapse and I told her yesterday that I could no longer in good conscience continue seeing her while deliberately hiding my relapse.

But it became too much. The weight was too heavy to carry on my own. But I didn’t want to burden anyone with it, especially because right now, I have no intention of recovering. I hid it from everyone. My husband finally said something after my mother reached out to him and he admitted he noticed how much weight I had lost and wasn’t sure how to approach the subject because we all know how complex EDs are. They have copious triggers, which must be approached very delicately. And I do know it’s exhausting for people to know what to say and how to say it.

My husband expressed his concern and he expressed concern on behalf of my mother. So I made an appointment with my therapist. No more secrets. Yesterday, I said to her, *WHY* is this all happening now? Like, all of these things from my past, why can’t I just get over it? Because outwardly, things in my life have never been better (and it’s true). So WHY can’t my stupid messed up mind catch up with me? 

And she said that’s exactly it. She said, “You have been through so much trauma and there are so many complex layers and you have just been moving through it. Surviving. You never had time to pause. But now you have stability in your life. You have a stable job after years of instability. You are in a stable relationship and now married after years of abuse and unloving partners. And even your relationship with your family is much better now. So now you have time to pause. You can start to digest.”

And she said that it is just too much for me to pause and allow the feelings to come up that have been building over decades and I just can’t allow myself to feel all of this pain and digest everything. So I fall back onto my ED as a means to cope. 

And it really shook me to my core. Like, it really does all make sense now. 

I am not ready to recover yet. And I know like any addict—because that’s what an eating disorder is—I have to be ready to recover, but I am at least grateful I confided in her. She is a safe space. I am at least grateful I don’t have to harbor this awful secret anymore and I have someone who is qualified to help me carry it.

Maybe one day I will choose recovery. In the mean time, I am doing what I can. I am doing the best that I can."
Disordered,"i’ve relapsed…  i don’t really know how to deal with being back in this place again, i’m back on pr0ana sites i even got ana buddies to keep me motivated, and it’s destroying me…"
Disordered,"weekend trip  I’m so stressed, I am going away for a few days for the holiday weekend and have been starving myself in preparation and plan to starve after which is miserable but I feel like I have no other option. Even still I’m so scared of coming home and the scale being higher than when I left. Which feels inevitable. How do you all handle social interactions? Specifically days long, I can handle one meal out but multiple days is so scary."
Disordered,"how does everyone handle this?  TW ( can be very long)
so for a little back story, i’ve been suffering from anorexia for a year now ( self diagnosed tho) and i’ve lost a considerable amount ( actually a LOT ) of weight in this time and I’m currently still under restriction and underweight. So one thing I’ve experienced is that people not complimenting me but rather complaining that I look sick and skeletony. Initially when I was at a borderline healthy weight, i used to get complimented for being fit ( that was also when I over exercised). But now every time i meet someone i know, all they say is that i look sick, starving, skinny and skeletony (in a ugly way). They make fun of me for not eating ( passing comments like, ‘Right, you won’t eat right?’) and they also compare me with my past self when i was chubby and a bit fat and say things like, ‘you used to be so plump and chunky’ or ‘what, are you on a diet and not eating so you could lose weight?’. These comments just hurt and trigger me so badly. I get so angry but all I could do is just put on a smile and not say anything. Ive started to hate going out and meeting anyone bc everyone comes back to that. I used to love going to my grandparents and cousins places but now i totally loathe it because they keep judging me ( also bc they try to stuff me with loads of food). Ik i cant expect them to understand what Im going through but they can atleast leave me alone right? and my parents do this as well, and this always starts fights at home. does anyone have this happening to them? can someone tell me how to handle this? i appreciate any help :/"
Disordered,nervous because my mouth get dry after eating sugar  i have looked it up on google and it says that it may be because i have diabetes? is it the only cause? i thought it was because i have developed a sugar intolerance after stopping eating it for so long but now im not so sure
Recovery,"just ate a whole meal  it's been quite a while since i've eaten a full meal. it was a ""special"" occasion and my whole family was there so i couldn't just say no. i'm scared that i'm going to spiral, but for the time being, i don't feel too bad. small victories lol :D"
Recovery,"does this sound like anorexia ?  i am going to approach this question differently that I normally do just to make it seem more sensical

i have never been comfortable with my body shape , nor the number on the scale

i fear gaining weight

i tweak my food intake to keep things in check , but do not constantly restrict

i find the sense of control gratifying

i stress eat , and when I say this it is not necessarily a high amount of food , but rather extremely unhealthy

that is a decent outline of what is going on , does this look like a relapse of sorts ?"
Disordered,"Anxiety about going out to eat with people  So I work at an office job and I know a lot of my colleagues notice how I don’t really eat lunch often. And sometimes they even question it, but I always just laugh it off and ignore the questions. Today, is one of my co workers birthdays and we’re all going out to lunch to celebrate. And I have so much anxiety about what I’ll order or simply anxiety over the fact that I’ll have to eat. Having these thoughts is literally so draining.."
Disordered,"Therapy exercises  I had therapy today, and I found my homework this week really tricky and triggering. It was a 24/7 exercise and I was just too busy to fill it all in. I brought the folder of what I did do and they just switched off the call amd told me to do it again. I explained that I found it made me worse, weighing everything and they wanted it right down to the sugar in a cup of coffee just doesn't work for me. I'm sure some people found it so helpful and loved it, but I just can't, and I explained that.
If I say I can't do something, I get told off every single time, and it's just not a therapy thing that works with me. I explain that I've always been a small person, and I've never weighed the target weight (like 2kg off it) and I get told off and told I'm going to fail and die because I didn't finish my dinner last tuesday.
Does anyone else get those days in therapy where you get so frustrated with it and just don't want to do the exercises?"
Disordered,"i steal food?! - grocery store  yo, i can't stop myself. if i spend money on food and feel bad afterward, i might just as well steal it so i won't have to pay for feeding the body i'd rather starve? i mean, i don't constantly feel bad around food; if i eat a healthy snack (raw nuts, plain yogurt, fruits, etc) i'd feel relatively right but those are so costly! to be honest, i don't even struggle financially at all. i don't know why i keep doing that. maybe i feel like i don't deserve to eat (classic) and therefore, i shouldn't spend the money i earned on something that could potentially keep my ed away? please, don't do that though; that's bat shit crazy, know your worth. eat (at all cost)!"
Disordered,Blood sugar problems  My blood sugar has been high the past couple of days after not eating for several hours. I would think it would drop with not eating but it goes up. And I get this nauseous shaking feeling too. Any ideas?
Recovery,"DSM severity scale  Anyone else frustrated that the DSM-5 removed the threshold for anorexia diagnosis? It says BMI >17 is “mild” anorexia, but my doctor treats it like 17 is the cut-off and writes “atypical anorexia” on my notes if I’m above that BMI.

The DSM severity scale effectively set a series of goalposts for me… I feel like I have to hit at least the “severe” category to be legitimately deserving of care/concern (even though I know that thinking is totally flawed).

I don’t know why the diagnosis is so important to me, but it is."
Disordered,"Grocery shopping anxiety  There’s a brand new Trader Joe’s opening up near me and I know it’s going to be INSANE and I’ll probably see like 50 people I know there . I love TJ because of their low prices and I like and miss their products but I don’t think I’ll be able to handle shopping in front of people. I have to check all the labels to make sure garlic and or onions isn’t in the product because I react intensely. So I look even crazier looking at all the labels, it doesn’t help that people look at me weirdly since I’m lean and in shape. Maybe I should just wear clothing that covers my body so no one stares at me. This fuckin blows. Or maybe I should just go at 8:30 pm Right before they close so no one is there"
Recovery,"Recovery question  Do you start to get “recovery symptoms” (like bloating, cramping, diarrhea/constipation) when you’re still undereating, but eating slightly more than before?"
Disordered,"please do not read if in active recovery  Vent: I can't really talk about this with anyone I know, but I think I'm going into full relapse mode. I've been trying so hard for the last 2 years to get better now that I have a daughter. A few nights ago I found proof that my (now ex) boyfriend/father of my child has been cheating on me. I've also been dealing with his narcissistic abuse for 4 years and have just now come to the realization that I've been stuck in these betrayal/false hope cycles. I've lost all sense of self worth and control, and I think we all know what that means here. I haven't eaten for days. I can't. Everytime I look at myself or at food I want to vomit. I'm so sick about everything right now. The only thing I feel like I have control over right now is what I consume."
Disordered,"Therapist may have accidentally given me a new g.w.  I know he didn’t mean it and I feel bad for twisting his words which meant well into fuel for the ED, but basically he was trying to say “my guess is that even if u reach X or Y weight, you still won’t feel sick enough/valid enough”. 

I had never given him my goal weight before, I just said that I wanted to get a bit more underweight, but the two numbers he said are lower than what my goal weight was, and so it made me feel even more invalid? I know it wasn’t his intention and I feel bad for feeling like this but fuck I feel like I need to reach at least X now. 

I’m tired of this I don’t even want to be this way anymore it just feels like there’s no other choice. This is a relapse and last time I started to recover JUST as I reached the stupid anorexia underweight criteria, and this time I’m there again and NOT about to recover (even tho part of me wishes I could) and it feels like it’s my chance to be a “REAL” anorexic this time. This is so stupid. being self aware with this mental illness is the worst."
Disordered,triggered  So yesterday.... I didn't eat anything except dinner ( a chicken taco with cheese/lettuce) and last night I decided I could have a fun size candy bar and a Klondike bar (haven't had one in awhile) and my bf tells me it's the most calories he's seen me eat in awhile. I even told him I didn't eat anything earlier in the day ( I tried to eat a fiber bar and threw it up on top of having stomach issues all day). It made me feel like I'm doing something wrong!!
Disordered,"Relapse triggered by covid (possible TW)  I had covid last week, and spent three days in bed, most of which were spent asleep. Now that I'm starting to recover from that, I'm noticing that my appetite still hasn't returned and food just isn't appealing to me. 

In these situations, I find old habits tend to come back, and I feel more tempted to restrict/ skip meals because nothing is appealing or I'm just simply not hungry. It's just frustrating because I don't want to force myself to eat due to finally having learned healthy eating habits but falling into the old/familiar thoughts and habits"
Disordered,"I'm scared  I'm relapsing really badly. I don't want to get to where I was before... But I can't seem to stop myself either. I don't want to lose more weight, but I don't want to gain more even though I know I need to. 

But I think one of the scariest things is that whenever my AN gets better, my depression gets worse. I feel like it should be the opposite? But in the past, whenever I have been relapsing... Sure, I have been sad and anxious, but not as bad as when I am eating regularly? Those are the times where self-harm and suicidal thoughts are the worst. 

I'm scared of not recovering, but I am also scared to recover. I just feel so stuck and I keep going in circles - I wish I could escape my own mind."
Disordered,"feeling physically hungry, but too depressed to eat.  before I started to get worse, all I wanted to do was eat because I was restricting so much. now all i wanna do is not eat. i don't have the mental appetite anymore. i think at this point i could be hallucinating the hunger. and of course i might only get worse once school's back, but at least there's some sort of chance i'll still be willing to eat. there's too much going on. i thought summer vacation was supposed to be relaxing? all i'm feeling is stressed and depressed. and i don't know what to do."
Recovery,"Asking for help.  To make this short my friend convinced me to tell my GP about my problems with eating. But idk how to tel them or how to bring this up into conversation.

If anyone knows how to tell my doctor about this it would help alot. Any tips are appreciated."
Recovery,Question !  Will I gain weight eating my BMR? I’ve been eating under it and scared to go above it
Disordered,"I think I'm going to relapse for the first time after 2 years   I have been eating normally for over 2 years and I even started to like my body and thinking that I don't need to lose weight but now I feel like I want to start restricting again.

I was telling my mum about an outfit I'd like to wear and she told me ""don't wear that pair of jeans it shows you bellyfat"" and when I told her ""but you told me that I'm not fat, are you telling me now that I am?"" She replied by laughing and saying ""it's not like it's me who made you fat"".

I want to starve myself until she sees that I can be skinny again and start begging me to eat.

I feel so disgusting and self aware right now"
Disordered,Prozac  Any of you cool cats on Prozac? Just got prescribed and I’m too scared to start. Any reviews 😅
Recovery,"tips for early recovery  i don’t know why but i rlly hate using the term ‘recovery’ even tho it’s such a generic way of saying you’re trying to get better from a mental illness / addiction but anywaysss. i just need some advice for early early recovery like when you first start. for reference i am still underweight, only just in terms of bmi but very far off being weight restored to my old body/weight. however i am being discharged by the end of august even tho im not weight restored or moving on to the next stage of treatment. i wouldnt say ive properly tried recovery before, i find it very hard to commit to and i know im going to have to do it in small stages so i can keep with it. id be interested to know how it feels in terms of emotions early on, what symptoms to expect, and how to keep going. i have been diagnosed also with MADD (mixed anxiety depressive disorder) too and am on prozac. any comments are appreciated <3"
Recovery,"Relationship and Anorexia  My girlfriend or now ex-girlfriend has anorexia. I had a job where i was almost not home for 1 year and when i came back i sensed that she might have problems eating and finally she admitted that she suffers from anorexia. My sister has bulimia so i know a little bit how to handle it. But i was also very afraid, because i know that anorexia is very dictating and i made the experience that to defend themselfes they are sometimes very mean to you. My ex gf suffered bad depressions for ca half a year when i worked outside and when i came back until now. after i came back and i tried everything to help her. Leaving her privatesspace if she needs or be there for here. I talked a lot with her when she was able to open herself she had so much insights. But all this openess would go away after a frw days....then depression kicks in again and ""everything is my fault"" and im ""the asshole that doesnt treats her right""....shes a little princess too...and that was always okay for me....but for example she never cleaned the flat....but when i talked with her about this she becomes angry and its not possible to talk about the subject because it becomes personal very quick, she also beat me a few times. First time she beat me i tried to calm her down without effect....and them i had to nail here on the ground because she wouldnt stop....i didnt beat back or anything i just took her to the ground so she cant beat me anymore. After that she said she couldnt trust me anymore because i nailed her to the ground and that she saw something in my eyes that shes afraid of now that i could harm her. I know that she knows thats bs...and after a few days all of this was forgotten. When i wanted to talk to her about the incidence she again said its all my fault and then she gets personal and then the talk is over.....After a long time trying, i couldnt talk to her like before when it comes to for example cleaning. My voice became more stressed and demanding and all this made it worse. But i tried it a long time diplomatic, talk normal to her and i just cleaned then. These are all just a few examples ive been together with her for 2,5 years now......and i managed to get her in a clinic 2 weeks ago week. Its where she goes during the day and comes back in the evening. Last week she just broke up with me because we had an argument and then she said ""that its my fault that shes not feeling good and that she has no energy for this"". She moved out the next day and cancelled our flat. Shes ignoring my messages and if she answers she just says thats shes done and that she doesnt wants to be together with me anymore. Her mother and sister has borderline and she acts kinda like them right now. In their family its always the fault of the other. They are very rich and she barely ever said thank you or sorry for anything. Like there are not much insights of her own behaviour.


Why am i writing this here? I thought maybe you can help me to understand her. I leave her alone and dont message her anymore...i would move on if she wants it, but if she just needs time id give her the time. I feeld bad for her too and i want her to become healthy and happy....and if i cant help her with this im the wrong person....but fo you think there are any chances that she will come back? Do you think its just a phase? Im not sure if i can handle all this anymore as well and maybe its better now how it is....but i love her. When she has her open phase shes just adorable and lovely with so much empathy....but then its gone after a short amount a time. 

I hope that i didnt offend anybody here and i hope you dont think im just an idiot that doesnt try to understand anorexia. Thats why im writing here. To understand. 


Thanks for listening."
Recovery,"Food suggestions  Ok I just read the rules about safe foods and it kinda defeats the purpose of my post. I need help with easy foods to eat because I have only a few. This mostly has to do with nausea. I’m nauseous all the time, every day. There are only certain foods I can stand to eat sometimes. I’m trying to better my eating habbits and would like help with easy things that I could have. Reddit, please don’t take this down I need help."
Disordered,I went swimming.  I weight restored. I don’t recognize my body at all. Boy body. It’s new to me. Nobody I meet will know that I was elegant for most of my life. It’s good my mind works smoothly now though. I’m unhappy except for that and my skin looks prettier.
Disordered,"my sister is skinner than me  i (f17) am well aware that i have gained a little bit of weight ever since i started eating well again, today my elder sister (f19) borrowed my trousers and to my surprise they were extremely loose for her and on the other hand they fit me perfectly, this made me realise ‘i’m fatter than her’ and now i feel like absolute shit because the very reason i starved myself in the first place was because i wanted to be more like her (she’s gorgeous) 
if you see this please try to say something, thank you."
Disordered,"It seems like I’m doing everything wrong  I just vent here because I have no one to talk about this lol. 

So lately I have been in what I thought that was recovery or at least semi recovery (if that makes sense) and I was super proud of myself, told my psychiatrist that I’m not purging as much as I was months ago. He just turned to me and said that what I am doing is not leading me to recovery, it seems that I’m engaging in other ED behaviors and that he is worried that my heart will fail anytime soon and that I should get checked by a physician. I was proud of myself because I haven’t weighed myself in a long time, I’ve been eating more (at least I thought it was enough but it wasn’t ) and I just can’t seem to do this on my own 🥺"
Disordered,"Extreme Hunger Guilt in All-In Recovery :-O  Hello everybody :-) firstly, I just wanted to say, I am so, so thankful that I've found this community <3 I've been reading all your posts/responses, particularly around intuitive eating and extreme hunger in recovery, and it's made me feel less lonely and guilty in this crazy ol' recovery journey, so thank you so much :'-).
 I have finally ACTUALLY committed to the all-in recovery approach the last week, and I know it's the right thing approach for me to get my life back, and don't know if this is a little weird but when I wake up I often feel excited about what snacks/meals/takeaways I can try that day, as I am naturally a huge foodie!
I know my anorexia got its claws into me because I have always compared myself to others and never felt good enough; and I have always been known for being a foodie and having a 'big appetite'; I'd be the friend who went for a second dessert or was always snacking :-P but over time I felt a lot of shame around that when people made jokes about it, even though I've never been classified as 'overweight' (even though I think BMIs are a load of balls lol). 
So now I'm experiencing the extreme hunger every day, the comparison to my boyfriend/friends/lots of people on social media makes me feel so ashamed. I honestly lose track of how much I eat, from boxes of cereal to whole batches of brownies to jars of my true love, nutella (always the carbs and sugar lol). I start to really worry that I'll never be able to stop and I'll go too far the other way, and I know the more I restore weight, the more people will think I'm healed when I feel I have so far to go mentally! It is so hard to practice self-care and resting too - feel sooo lazy, but I know I can't compromise with excefcise like I always used to. I jusr don't understand how I can eat sooo much, nap and then wake up hungry again! Thank god for Disney Plus! I was standing in the kitchen eating through the entirety of Moana haha.
 I also feel like I shouldn't even be experiencing EH, as I've only been battling with my anorexia for about 18 months, and I know so many have been fighting it for such a large part of their lives :-( I'm sorry if you have.
 My question really is, is anybody else experiencing/pr has experienced any of these things?
Whoops I'm so sorry, this wasn't meant to be such a long rant! :-P Could talk about it for hours haha, learning so much each day.
I hope you are all doing OK <3 I am so proud of you all on your own recovery journeys. Trying to learn that everybody will have differences in this complicated illness, and their own individual needs - but we are all in this together! Thank you so much for reading, here if anybody else ever wants to chat <3 Jess xxx"
Disordered,"started a new job  started a new job last week and I was going through a relapse so I hadn’t eaten breakfast before I started my shift. Literal worst 4 hours, zoned out/complete brain fog, couldn’t tell the difference between right and left and I think I made such a bad impression with the manager on my first shift! 

really had to contemplate my priorities bc this job is so important to me so if I don’t eat, I will probably get fired eventually but the urge to relapse was so strong. I’m not atm bc theyres no way I would survive even a single shift and the work is somewhat laborious as well so 

A bit random lol but felt like you guys would understand"
Disordered,"Quitting smoking w ED  Curious if any of you have quit smoking tabaco successfully. We all generally have our control issues and I’m both worried about gaining weight smoking, or heavily relapsing into my Ed, maybe both, but I really want to quit. 

Any advice, experience, etc welcome. Have also posted in the quit smoking group."
Disordered,"My friends are making it hard  Ever since I’ve been home, I’ve been in this quasi-recovery state so that way people won’t ask questions and life is easier. It’s fucking killing me on the inside and I hate it so much but it’s the best thing I can do for myself right now. The main issue though is that now that my friends think that it’s over, they have the green light to just talk about it and joke about it whenever. The worst is when they took me to Red Lobster and pointed out cals in meals and were still making jokes non-stop about it. Yesterday my friend said I “left my Eugenia Cooney era.” It pisses me off so much because I am in such a limbo and it makes me resentful because I just wanna be sick in peace but I can’t anymore and they’re kinda rubbing it in. Idk I just hate it and I’m sorry if this breaks the rules but it’s honestly where I’m at."
Disordered,"confusion about diagnosis  im not expecting anyone to know the answer to this, but this is really fucking with my head and i need to talk about it somewhere.  my dietician told me today that she isn't 100% i am anorexic because my psychiatrist didn't attach any assessment or notes with the referral, she only said that i have anorexia nervosa.  im so confused, i thought i was diagnosed, i was told last appointment this was a diagnosis, but it looks like this isn't the case anymore.  my psychiatrist never says anything unless she is 100%, so im confused on why she would write this in my referral if she wasn't concrete.  maybe she is and maybe it is a solid diagnosis and im just over thinking this.  my dietician said that its still there in writing, as far as she's concerned i am anorexic but she just wants clarification.  but idk, this is messing with me so much.  a diagnosis is so important to me, it proves that my suffering is valid and that it matters.  i thought id finally gotten it, but it looks like it could've been a lie.  idk what to think anymore"
Disordered,"how do you guys help the hair fallout/ what do you do to prevent it  my hair is coming out in clumps and thinning so badly, it’s been gradually getting worse but every time i run my hands through my hair it falls out and then in the shower it comes out in large groups, how can i help it???"
Disordered,"never gets better  It’s the same everyday. I eat 3 meals a day sometimes a snack (usually nuts). Even though it’s not close to a normal sized portion, i do eat. And the minute I finish my meal I’m just washed with the guilt of eating a lot. I keep feeling like i binged. I feel awfully fully, dying to just purge it out, which I thankfully don’t. How much ever I convince myself that I didn’t eat a lot, i just can’t get over this feeling it’s been over a year and it never gets better. I loathe the feeling of being full and having even a bit makes me feel full. ik people have it a lot worse than me who don’t eat for days but I comparatively eat A LOT MORE than most people here and …i just don’t know how to get over this. I always feel like I i eat a loads more than people around me though I actually don’t. The sane part of me knows how idiotic it sounds but I just can’t seem to believe that i eat way less. Even if i keep reducing my portion size, I still feel like i eat a lot.. and when this happens I obsessively calorie count the entire day, repeatedly over and over and do nothing else…consciously and subconsciously, i keep replaying what and how much i ate, and how much i should eat later so that I don’t over eat. It’s so tiring and exhausting but I can’t seem to get out of this and as tough and exhausting it is, I don’t want to get better as well…it’s a fuckin mess. does anyone get it :("

Disordered,"exhausted and stuck in an endless loop  i’m so exhausted everyday. it’s a constant cycle of trying to be forgiving to myself for eating, trying to convince myself it’s okay to eat, my body needs nutrients, i’m only hurting myself more by not eating, that it’ll pass one day i’ll be able to look at myself without criticism, but then it’s an immediate 180° of well you wouldn’t feel like this if you were skinnier, you won’t feel better unless you lose weight, you won’t ever be comfortable if you keep gaining weight, youre not doing enough, you’re eating too much, not the right things, etc. i’m so tired of my hair falling out, of my stomach rumbling, of counting calories unintentionally, of being exhausted but i don’t know how to break it. i’ve tried therapy and coping mechanisms and changing language, writing it out, crying it out, etc. it’s just exhausting to keep repeating the cycle. i don’t know how or if it’s even possible for me to get better anymore."
Disordered,"How long until heart problems happen when restricting?  I (24F) have been battling with anorexia for about a year or so now and was doing much better in my recovery, seeing my doctors and a dietician. 

However, the past 2 weeks especially I have been restricting again pretty heavily. I’m trying to reintroduce simple but healthy foods back into my body currently but I also have a lot of anxiety surrounding my health in general. 

About how long does it take for the body to start doing lasting heart damage? Can it happen this quickly/do I need to go back to the doctor and get labs/ekg done again? I’m just so anxious and can’t think straight about anything. Thank you<3"
Disordered,"Doctor appointment and idk if i should mention my ed.  In a couple of days im going to have a check up with a doctor and i dont know if i should mention my struggles with food. I've never been diagnosed with an ed but have alot of the same problems as those who have it. 
Should i tell me doctor about this even tho im already in some way trying to recover by myself. Is there even i point in telling her if im trying to get better without anyone else."
Disordered,"My date called me skinny and I don't know how to feel about it.  It's been years since anyone has called me skinny given the fact that I've gained a lot of weight. My mom never fails to tell me how fat I am and how I need to lose my ""tummy,"" so granted I'm self-conscious as fuck about my appearance.

We were sitting down on the grass next to each other and he grabbed my wrist and said ""wow you're so skinny."" At first I was taken aback. I thought to myself, ""shouldn't I be happy that someone in this world views me as skinny?"" However, for some reason I wasn't happy about his comment. I then proceeded to say ""no my thighs are huge, look."" He then said ""no they aren't."" After, I said, ""look at my stomach, it's bulging out,"" to which he said ""I don't see anything."" We had just finished eating and I was bloated (also on my period) so he must've been blind, right? I then said, ""well you must've been with thicker girls in the past,"" to which he said ""not at all.""

I'm really confused about the interaction. It made me realize that maybe this is just my body dysmorphia talking which I had a lot of when I had the disease. I still have an eating disorder so maybe it wasn't a good thing that he commented on my weight. I just finished working out, looked in the mirror and saw fatness, so idk."
Disordered,"Help me fix my mindset  I am being forced to have a bunch of fortisips in inpatient treatment and have developed severe behaviours to try and prevent myself from gaining weight on them. The only issue is that the staff on my unit know what I’m doing and won’t give me more food until I stop the behaviours. 

The problem is I feel like gaining weight on replacement drinks and not real food is such a waste and I have convinced myself that if I don’t engage in these behaviours I’ll gain a whole bunch of weight. 

How do I either convince myself that gaining weight in this way isn’t a waste or that not doing these behaviours won’t have any impact on my weight? Honestly, I’m probably only avoiding a couple of millilitres per drink, which realistically wouldn’t be more than 20-30 calories per day. 

I‘m just terrified of gaining weight on replacement drinks.

Any advice/help would really be appreciated."
Recovery,"Does anyone else hate doing the food diaries?  I dont know what it is about it that I just hate so much. I feel like it makes it worse, because I feel more inclined to restrict if I have to write it down, I always forget and I just hate it. I feel like they judge me for what I ate when I show it to them, even though they probably aren't. I'm always counting down the days until we can move on from it because I just forget to do them, go back and try to remember, can't, get told off and they've not helped me in my recovery, I feel like I get worse when I write it down because I know someone's looking and judging what I ate so I feel more inclined to eat less or differently. Also if I'm out, I can't just grab a piece of paper and do the food diary when I eat something, and then I forget when I get home.

Does anyone else get this or is it just me who hates the food diaries so much? This is the second or third time they've made me do them and I just wanted to scream when they gave me it. My therapists have never used them, they just look at it and judge me or tell me off for not finishing a piece of cake last tuesday at 10am or something like that.

Just needed to vent about that because I have to do one right now and it's driving me insane"

Just this short lived drawback has made my digestive tract so upset — my hunger cues are gone again and I’m always nauseous. I’m back to drinking Ensures to get nutrients. I wish this never happened and I’m feeling pretty dumb for letting myself regress again, even if it was just for a few days.

These past few weeks have probably been the worst for me. I haven't eaten an actual meal in so long and I can tell I'm getting worse. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm comfortable eating a few snacks that I'd usually see as ""high calorie"", because I know that, at the end of the day, it's going to mean nothing. I know that, because I'm not going to eat an actual meal or anything for a while, it's okay for me to consume something like that. 

I'm allowing myself to eat because I know I'm getting worse, and I feel like since I'm allowing myself to do that, I don't really have a problem? 

I'm not sure. It's all confusing. It hurts to think about, but I guess I was wondering if anyone did the same thing and knows how to avoid this mindset. It's as if I allow myself to indulge in something I wouldn't usually because I know I'm going to need it, but at the same time, that action is throwing me in to not believe the gravity of the eating disorder. Any way I can throw myself out of this mindset? I think it's the worst one I've had."

Lately I’ve been going all day with nothing but fluids and at night maybe eating a full meal, maybe… but it’s a full meal for me, not like as much as my wife eats even. 

I tried making myself snack in daytime and I just get nauseated. Even if I just eat a couple pb crackers, it’s like eating makes the hunger pains occur? I don’t even know anymore… but when I get that nauseated I can’t eat, especially if I’m at work because I can’t just throw up on my patients and expect them to be okay with this.

Disordered,"I just need to vent  Hi, I made this account just to vent, so I might not log back in but I can’t say this to anyone.

I’ve struggled with my weight ever since November 2020 because I became depressed (my mother died after being bed bound for 6 years and I was struggling with my sexuality & religion ) and started binge eating to cope with it all. It didn’t “catch up” with me until July 2021. I didn’t really do anything to slim down until I went to a vacation to NYC in December 2021, and I saw how the pictures came out. I felt disgusted by the way my body looked, it was just horrible to look at. I then started to slim down and I felt great. I was slimmer and just all around healthier. 

But I always had a feeling like it wasn’t enough, that my sister who recovered from anorexia but was still skinny , that she was just better and prettier than me. Along with other things in my life, this made me realize that I have no control over goddamn anything. I also have low self esteem so I naturally just want validation from anyone. So ever since the start of June 2022, I’ve been restricting myself. Not starving, but just making sure it’s just under a certain amount of calories, exercising every chance I can, and making sure that I’m loosing enough weight to meet my goal. 

I feel like I’m obsessing now, like food is the main factor in my life and if I look ugly than I’m fucking worthless. Half of me thinks that I’m being ridiculous but I can’t look at food anymore without think of the scale going up. Hell, part of me thinks I’m just faking because I want to suffer for no reason. I don’t know what to do; I can’t tell anyone because I’ve been put in a mental hospital before and I promised myself I will never go back there, but also I don’t want to ever put my family through another thing again. Also, I don’t want to gain weight, I’m not even underweight so it’s pointless. 

But it’s a burden to obsessively count your calories, constantly think about what low calories thing can you eat and yet also be the happy girl in the family, it’s fucking exhausting.

I can’t tell this to anyone but I need to get this out. Thank you for listening Reddit. - VP"

Every time I eat I just have to sit down for an hour because I feel so fucking winded and it’s hard to talk/stand/breathe and my heart starts to beat like crazy and it just… hurts. I’m going to visit a doctor soon but … I don’t know. Some emotional support from other ED sufferers would help. Has anyone else experienced this? I’m just so paranoid that now that I actually want to live and get better my body is going to fail me because of how much I’ve fucked it up."
Disordered,"been eating more recently and now i'm scared :(  Ever since summer vacation's started, I feel like I can't restrict or fast as much as I want to, and I feel like it's just gonna make me bigger again, like I was before. :( I don't wanna gain anything back but I can't just not eat or I'll be forced to recover, and I know how badly that works. I haven't even been able to workout because I'm constantly being nagged to ""watch tv,"" but I can't spend the whole day sitting, I need to workout. Idk what else to do. :("
Disordered,"how to get energy back after being sick?  Possible TW. 

So about a week ago (last Wednesday), i woke up really sick with the flu. I tried to work out the first day, as i thought it was just allergies but then took a few days off as the illness progressed. It honestly wiped me out so much, with body aches, dizziness, and nausea. Complete weakness, too. Like walking from my bedroom to the bathroom was draining and left me out of breath (still kind of does). I started trying to go back to the gym on Monday but have not had any improvement in my energy levels. I find myself dreading going in because i feel so weak and drained, and working out with a mask on only makes the dizziness worse. However, the idea/thought of missing any more time working out freaks me out. I'm already so upset with myself for skipping most of the weekend.

I just don't know how to get the energy back. I feel so drained. Even just light stretching and walking is difficult. And any time i have tried to go into the store to walk or move around more, I feel like i should have taken one of those motorized carts. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to gain some energy back? Not only for the gym but just to function more in general, too. Like i said, even walking to the bathroom can be so tiring right now, even though it's been a week. 

I will note that I did take two covid tests, a couple of days apart, and both were negative. so it isn't that. I still have been wearing a mask in public places just so i don't spread germs even more.

I hope this doesn't go against guidelines and I am sorry if it does. Posted in another forum and it was deleted."
Disordered,"Please please please keep me in your thoughts/prayers  Hey y’all,

Hope everyone is doing well today. 

I’m hiding in my work bathroom trying not to cry because I got on the scale today and saw my weight was up by one pound. I know it’s dramatic, but I’m terrified this one pound can turn into more and I’m trying to lose weight, not gain it. (In a healthy way but struggling with that so…) 

I’m trying to be rational with the “weight fluxuating is normal/just got on birth control and told my OBGYN not to put me on something that will make me gain weight/i’m close to my period so it’s okay” but nothing is sticking. I’m already trying to figure out how I can skirt around lunch and how I can reject dinner at a friends house tonight. So this + ARFID + new job = aaaaa.

Anyway. Yes. Please just? Send good vibes or whatever. I went through IOP and I just want to get better and i hate that I’m regressing so much. I feel so alone. 

Thanks for reading."
Disordered,"DAE eat really weird things at night ?  I don’t binge. I have a very restrictive Ed. Even if I wanted to binge I can’t. At night, I tend to eat my main “meal”. And before bed i l usually need to eat a snack or nibble on something. I’ll eat weird things like lettuce dipped in mustards, or lettuce dipped in yogurt, cucumbers and mustard, coconut milk and stevia. It just basically the lowest cal whatever I have just so I can eat something so I can go to sleep. I know this is a form of night eating syndrome, but since it’s not binging or eating a lot at all, I don’t know how to assess it. It’s annoying though. I wish I could be “normal” and stop eating 2 hours before bed. I don’t think I’ll ever be the kind of person who can just stop eating at 7 pm and go to sleep. Maybe if I was I would finally lose the last lbs but I feel better when my eating window is at night instead of during the day."
Disordered,Semi recovery  I have been doing well in semi recovery but I have gained weight and I just can’t deal with it. I am nothing without my eating disorder.

Recovery,"What could someone say to push you to recovery?  I’ve seen an influx of ‘how can I support this person/ help push them to get better’ posts, and it got me curious.

{TW because of personal experience ??}

After moving out at 18, then returning home at 20 for a brief period, I went from obese to underweight in the last six or so months before I moved back home. After about a month, my father looked at me with the most dreadful, sorrowful look in his eyes. When I asked him what was wrong, he replied ‘you’re just so skinny now. You look sick’.

It was such a wake up call. I felt like a glass mirror had been shattered, and for the first time in over six months, I really looked at myself. I had been losing hair like mad, had been having horrible horrible headaches for months, I was incredibly weak etc etc. after he said that, I looked in the mirror and truly didn’t even recognize myself. I was appalled at the shadow of a person that existed in my reflection. {although I’d obviously heard of Ed’s before, I had NEVER considered myself to be suffering from one- after much education and self-reflection, I realized I’d been struggling with disordered eating since about 3rd grade}

Anyways, after I had that stream of realizations, I restored myself to a healthy weight and began going to the gym again. I very much still struggle, but I know that, at the very least, I’ll never allow myself to get to that point again. 

And I know a lot of people will think my father was harsh, or being mean, but it truly was helpful for me. So I’m curious about what things someone may have said, or how someone may have acted, to really want to make you recover. Even if it was only 10 seconds of wanting to recover, what were some things that moved your heart?"
Recovery,"Distraught that rock climbing is building muscles in my arms  I first suffered with anorexia when I was 10. I dropped out of college due to anorexia, and developed bulimia and almost died. I'm recovered from eating disorders for the most part, and have started to rock climb as exercise. Only 2 weeks in and I feel as though my arms are getting huge! Im scared of looking manly and feel as though everyone is repulsed by me (esp men). It's making me feel really upset. I feel as though this will trigger me to relapse. I just want to cut this muscle off haha. I'm not sure if I'm bulking up or it's my body dysmorphia or both! What should I do? I don't want to give climbing up, as it's been elating. But, I also don't want to look like a man. That's in part why I relapsed in college- I got too muscular."
Recovery,"Advice for a sister?  My little sister (16) is struggling with anorexia nervosa- for the last 2/3 months she’s been in and out of hospital, and is now on antidepressants but still really struggling and waiting for a bed on an inpatient psychiatric ward. All the way through her treatment so far I’ve helped with meal times, emotional support, and being there for her, as I have a better understanding of EDs than our parents did at the start of all this. 

I (19, female) have struggled with depression, anxiety and PTSD for around 6 years now, and watching her struggling like this is really setting me back in my own recovery, because I’m struggling to make time for myself and my own self care because I’m so worried about her all the time. When I was severely ill in the past she was one of the only things that kept me going, she’s my best friend and I don’t know how to cope with not being able to help her. 

So now to my question- will she feel like I’m abandoning her if I take a step back and let my parents take charge now that they’re more educated on how to help her? I don’t want her to feel like I don’t care about her, but I’m also worried about how unwell I’m making myself by dedicating all my energy to her? 

Thanks xx"

I just wanted to say that because I’m not sure what to do
Disordered,Oh my god what is wrong with me  I didn't think it was \*that\* bad until just now my mom took a little bit of my snack which was just some   tiny fried things. I am literally on the verge of a panic attack because now I don't know how many calories are in it anymore and I have an estimate but I wanted everything to be perfect and I'm trying to tell myself that it's just less calories but I'm just so upset with myself for letting myself get this bad.

Disordered,"Taking it way too far  I used to smoke like 6-10 times a day, but I stopped last year because of the negative effect it was having on my mental health. I was probably addicted.

I feel sick… I’m so tired. I keep pushing myself to keep running farther and longer. By the end of the day I’m exhausted, and I’m riding the high the whole next day like I wakenbaked. Realizing the parallels between the weed addiction I overcame and my relapse is so frustrating. I’m primed for self destruction, no matter what I do. I don’t know how to stop these cycles…"
Disordered,"Is chewing food and spitting it out bad for you?  As a way of “satisfying” my hunger, I chew on food that I’m craving just so I can taste it, and then I spit it out so I’m not actually ingesting any food. 

Is this bad for me? Will it cause any long or short term health issues?"
Disordered,"Is the length of time you've had AN relative to the severity of it?  Like, can someone have it for a few months but be just as sick as someone who's had it for longer? If it takes you a really short time to recover, does that mean you weren't as sick? If you've had anorexia for a long time, is it harder to recover?

I'm genuinely confused here"
Recovery,"Challenging Fear Foods??  I've just decided to *try* to challenge my fear foods, as a part of recovery, but I'm not sure how to do it. I've seen people make lists, draw foods from a bag, and so on and so forth. Does anyone have experience doing this? How did it go?

Also, if you know that you never liked eating one of your fear foods (in my case, mint flavored stuff, taro, coconut, etc.), do you still have to challenge them? I mean, I know the point is to not be scared of  any foods, but what's the point if you wouldn't eat them anyways??"

I am shaking when I think about spending all weekend on the beach, I wasn’t wearing shorts or swiming suit in public for 5 fucking years. All I need right now is some time in complet isolation. My friends and family are mad at me, they don’t understand my situation and I don’t blame them. I really feel like fucked up person for doing it, but I am too terrified to  go there. I just so embarrased with my apperance. I can’t spend so many days among ppl.

Am I bad person for doing that? They can go without me as well, and my friend can take her bf so she wouldn’t be alone. However, they are still so mad at me and my mom said that I’m ruing everything and she made me feel like ungreatful bitch, but it would be just one weekend not spend together.

Disordered,"How does long term underweight affect genes?    

When I was a baby I had black hair. A few months after my birth my hair became light brown/red. After some time my hair would become darker. At the age of 4-5 or maybe even earlier my hair was very dark brown almost black. 

I am 29 years old (male) and I have anorexia nervosa for 8 years. I wasn´t able to give my body the nutrients it needed. And I noticed a lot of weird changes in my body. I read that long term underweight can affect your genes. I am very scared about this. A few weeks ago I noticed that my hair becomes red/light brown again. My cognition also changed and I feel like I am a child again. It feels like the time again when I had some real struggles with listening to people and remembering things. I noticed that these weaknesses and issues come back the longer my underweight/anorexia nervosa lasts. Is it possible that things will become good again? Will I be able to understand irony again once I gain weight again? Will my hair become dark brown again? Is it possible that due to malnourishment my genes changed? And will my genes switch again once I gain weight and hold that weight for a long period of time? I am kinda hopeless. I don´t feel like 29. More like 80. Underweight speeds up aging. I saw a video on youtube of a dog that was treated very badly by his owners. He didn´t get food and lost a lot of weight. There was nothing left but bones and skin. He was very thin. You could see his sickness in his eyes. He looked way older than he actually was. His eyes looked like death. His new owners treated him better by giving him food and attention. He is in a good place now and reached a healthy weight. Even tho he made all this success thanks to his owners you can still see that there is a difference between him and other dogs who have not suffered like he did. His eyes lost their glance and kept this tiredness. And I am scared about this. Will there always be a scar even tho I manage to „heal“ my anorexia/underweight?"

I’ve been trying to find a good balance between meals and exercise. So I have started exercising more (in addition to eating a little bit more and incorporating some of my fear foods).

Recovery,"fighting the urge to weigh myself  but honestly… the urge is winning. 
i’ve been doing really good these past few weeks and feeling really “recovered” - i’ve been eating really intuitively and being super honest with myself about when i’m hungry/when i’m not and acting accordingly. i even went back to running (i’ve been injured for a while but i’m trying to run D1 college cross country and i’m really excited about it - it’s what gets me up in the morning), and the running is kind of the main thing that’s been helping me get over the body dysmorphia and to not feel guilty about eating. 
the problem is i think the running is also making me lose weight. not intentionally this time, and it’s no where near as dramatic as when i was actively trying to lose weight, but i still suspect that it’s happening. 
i wanna weigh myself to confirm my suspicions - if i’m losing weight, i should probably know so i can address it - but i’m scared no matter what number i find on the scale, i’m gonna be triggered and then fall back into the ED mindset. if i lost weight i feel like ED brain is gonna get excited and takeover and i’m gonna start actively trying to keep the weight off/lose more. but if i didn’t lose weight, i’ll probably be really disappointed by the number i see and start trying to lose weight to get to a “better” weight.

But I hate myself anyway, so might as well be thin, right?

Well the good news i guess is that I’ve been referred for an ed assessment, which ill have in a few days, but i have a feeling inpatient will be mentioned, as it already has been to me, and I’m just terrified I’m gonna show up to the assessment and they say I have to go, i will lose my shit, deny help etc, as when I’m backed into a corner I tend to get a bit explosive, and im really scared they’ll section me. But im also trying to be as honest as possible and accept the help they offer. but i rlly rlly need it to be outpatient. Me and my BF are moving out for the first time and im so excited to start our new life together, work on myself etc, and i think being out of the family home will help, bc they put so much attention onto my ed it almost makes it worse. And i want to be healthy, have energy, warmth, true happiness. I want my eyes to smile in photos again. I don’t want my bf to have to watch me lose any more weight. I want peoples trust back. I’m so fucking exhausted living like this but i feel trapped. The idea of eating over a certain amount terrifies me and I really worry that even if i make it through the assessment and can be treated outpatient, i rlly worry the meal plan will be too much for me to handle. 

I understand right now i am not well, but i do not at all feel sick enough for ip. But i also don’t know if I’d be able to gain weight in outpatient. I’m so scared I don’t know what to do. All i can do is wait, and i hate it. My mind is going a mile a minute 24/7 about it. I feel like no one is listening to me, or telling me anything i hate it so so much.

If anyone has been in a similar situation, please give me advice i will take anything. I feel so alone in this"

I know InSuLiN ReSiStAnCe is this stupid buzzword, but with how much myself and others have to eat in recovery, im curious if it's possible to develop this or if the body, like with other processes in recovery, basically just goes wild and doesn't care about insulin or spikes and doesn't become insulin resistant"
Disordered,"[NSFW] Doing bad things due to my ED.  Hey guys, just a little rant today.

My ED has made me do some crazy things and I wish I never did any of it. I started sm0king a couple months ago because I heard it could sepress my hunger, I used to sm0ke atleast 8 cigarettes a day just so I wouldn't get hungry. I have asthma and it has f*cked up my lungs. I didn't really it could become addictive but it has, I always told myself I wouldn't sm0ke but here I am sm0king. Everytime I wanted to eat or got hungry I'd sm0ke, it such an awful habit. 

I even got to the point where I was doing dr*gs so I wouldn't eat and the hunger would go away. I regret everything now and I'm trying to get clean but every once in a while a wish I could go back to my old habits and just do a small amount so the hunger would go away.

I DO NOT recommend taking up sm0king or anything else because it ruins everything. I didn't eat for days because of the dr*gs and I had such horrible mood swings.

I am trying so hard to stop smoking and get back to normal but I feel so empty without it. I wish my ED would just leave me alone for a day.

I know this post doesn't make any sense and I know nobody cares but I feel like this is the only place where I can rant freely."
Recovery,"should i continue my sessions?   ***tw: weight, therapy talk. pls lmk if smth violated rules. i am just so desperate for someone who actually understands to read this situation.***

So, i've been in a psychotherapy for quite some time, and it has been pretty smooth since the doctor isn't so forcing at all, and is gentle, accepts whatever disordered shit I am doing.

but i noticed something. i posted about this before but here's additional experience (and probably clearer cause i have some lil energy to type unlike when i postted the first lmao)

so here's the thing.

Him: How are you? -small talks- how was your weight?

Me: I gained x kgs (when in reality, its been around \[more\] kgs OHMYGOOOOD WHAT HAVE I DONE)

Him: Congratulations. (LMAO I AM NOT CELEBRATING) How do you feel? (FCKED UP TBH) I'm glad ur taking slow steps to achieve our session's goal. Although we are still in the underweight category. But I'm happy and proud.

Me: I still feel quite weird. btw, what will happen if I gained all the required weight for my age or the normal range of BMI but I still feel like shit? Like I still feel guilty eating, and sometimes I overeat. Can I stop the sessions?

then he just didnt answer. he kept explaining about how my emotions control this behavior, how it triggers my ED, etc.

to all those who have knowledge about the process of recovery, is it really necessary to gain the required weight first than healing my mental health firsst? I AM SO CONFUSED, I WANT TO STOP THE SESSIONS BUT IM AFRAID IT IS MY ED TALKING? i keep insisting that it does not heal my mind abt my perception of food, but when i mentioned i gained, he just feel like its a process.

is it?

help me pls :< i dont even want to recover now lmao- im sorry-"
Disordered,"My ED has taken over my life.  Hi guys. Today has been a very hard day. Today I realised my ED has taken over me completely and I don't know how to feel.

I promised my dad I would cook him dinner as it was fathers day, I wasn't going to worry about the cals but as I sorting of the ingredients, I felt like I HAD to check. The number just kept on getting hight and HIGHER, I ended up having a breakdown over butter!!!! God damn butter!!! I started to hysterically laugh and talk to myself and full blown panic.

It was awful, I really didn't want to eat the food I was making my dad but it would've been the first meal we would've at together in a long time.

I pushed through and panicking along the way but I eventually ate it all. All I could think about though was how much dairy I just consumed, how much carbs I just consumed or how many cals I just consumed.

I then of course got 🍃 and Binged which wasn't fun.....

But today I realised that the numbers in my head have really gotten to me and has taken over every aspect of my life. I can't look at anything without thinking of the cals, I can't even look at my twins food without thinking of the cals. Its getting so bad.

I used to be quite overweight and now I’m on the skinnier end of healthy (though I don’t really see myself as skinny), and I was barely ever noticed let alone complimented. 

Now, I’ve had many people comment on how fit I’m looking lately and other various compliments I’ve never received before and probably the worst yet happened today. I wore a bright pink sweater which I’ve had for years. I used to wear this exact jumper to work when I was overweight and never received any compliments. Just today I received 10+ compliments on how nice the colour looks on me and the jumper itself. Now that it practically swallows me I’m complimented left and right. I couldn’t believe it. The thing is it’s not even a nice quality jumper, it’s from a fast fashion place  so I KNOW it’s not the jumper. I wear it as PJs, and I only wore it today because I binged yesterday.

I’ve yoyo-ed in weight many times over the years and it’s only ever when you’re skinny that people compliment and notice you. This is why I don’t think I’ll ever recover. I feel too sick to eat after today.

TLDR; people are biased jerks and only like skinny people"

Disordered,"letting yourself have a normal day of eating  since its fathers day im going to be surrounded by family and so much food. im also in charge of making some food. its impossible to restrict today and i also need more energy than usual to keep up with walking around, talking, cooking. all the food today isnt processed which makes counting calories literally impossible, and my body is not used to the amount of oil, butter, and sugar ive already had. i told myself yesterday id let myself eat normally today but after one meal, the guilt is setting in. hard. i still have obligations and one of them is tonight at a restaurant (calories arent on the menu or website) and not to mention, theres a shit ton of leftovers im already taking home, and wasting food makes me feel like a shit person. i also baked some goods and i know it'll raise questions and judgment im not ready for if i dont eat. im not sure if i should restrict the rest of the day or finish this day and just let myself eat normally. im already extremely bloated, but this is the most amount of energy ive had in weeks. i also feel like ive been faking it this whole time because today im just suddenly eating normally. just needed a place to vent. im conflicted :-/"
Disordered,Telling my close ones triggered me…  Okay so recently I decided to tell my family about my ED. I’d been thinking about telling them for a while since I realized I will not be able to recover by myself. I ended up telling them and they were so supportive but the thing is that their concern and their knowledge of my problem made me feel like I needed to prove it. It really triggered me and I feel like I in my attempt to actually get better just ended up being the worst I’ve ever been. And now I’m not only guilty about food I’m guilty about disappointing them because I can’t recover. I just feel like a failure no matter which angle I’m looking from.

Disordered,"I broke up. But I still want to help her. Any advice?  Dear lovely people,
I recently posted a vent where I stated to probably break up the relationship to the mother of my child. After a week of fighting I suddenly found peace and didn't blame her for anything. This is not her, this is her dark friend. And I figured that I have to look for myself and cannot change her. 

As we started dating, she was fine and we had great talks, emotions and a deep relationship. I even still consider her as my soulmate. We do not live together, but actually there was the plan to move together after long 3 years of relationship. We even don't live in the same city. So my plan for now is to move there, but I will take my own flat.

Yesterday I told her in a long (respectful/lovely/friendly) text message how I feel, that I don't blame her and that I am just tired now. And I stated, that I will visit her next week for a talk (will be a break up talk). So she knows already what is about to happen/has already happened. She is calm and understands my pov.

I do still love her, but beeing with her is just too painful and exhausting. It isn't her fault, she just acts, as she ever does.

Generally I am very worried about her health. She is exzessively sportive, loves to eat as less as possible and so on.

My door will always stay open for her, when she comes back from her journey.

In the planed talk next week, I want to encourage her in changing, doing therapy, consult doctors and tell her that I will give support where possible.

Do you have any advice here? How can I convince her to change? 

As a reminder we have a kid together and I maybe must start some law anforcement in order to save my little son. But this is the last thing I want to do. She is still my best friend and I love her. Best would be to ""wake her up"", gain her motivation, give her the vision of a safe family.

Disordered,"ED is a manipulative bitch  It’s so sad. We all know it. Makes you feel so save while destroying you from the inside out. Creates walls between you and everyone you love. Leads you down a path an never ending cycle. And when you try to break free, you feel so torn because you want to go back to your ED, even though you know it’s the last thing you should do. 
I hate it. I hate it so much and at the same time I feel like loosing control if I let go. I need time and pause my life - again. I put my loved ones through pain watching me - again. And I am a total and utter mess - again. 
I postpone to message my professor, that I can’t come to class anymore cause of personal reasons. I know I have to pull back on classes or I will drown. But I am so so so so scared to be a failure. Even though I am not. I put myself first which is a good thing. But my ED and my anxiety try to turn it around and use it against me. 
I just wanted to let that out. Maybe I can write this email now."
Disordered,afraid of gaining weight  I have been sick for a few days and lost some weight. Now it's nearly at my lowest (last time was 4 years ago).

Disordered,"My ED is ruining my life.  Hey everyone. I have been battling with my ED for almost years now and I'm getting so tired of it. I lost quite a bit of weight in a couple months then binged for MONTHS, everyday, without fail and gained so much more weight back, I am SO sick of this cycle. 

I feel like I'm so invalid and disgusting. I hate myself so much and I feel like I'll never be good enough for anybody. I've lost basically all of my relationships and close friends due to my mental health.

I'm at the point where I don't even enjoy food anymore, it feels like a chore. I can't go a minute without thinking about all the numbers and BC in every mirror I see.

I know I'm skinny-average but I still feel huge. I feel like I'll never be 'skinny enough' or perfect. I don't know what to do.

I have ruined my relationship with food and its took a toll on my relationship with my family. I can't eat the same meals as them, I can't go out and eat with them and I always get angry at them for trying to help.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. I stay inside all day, I rarely leave my room, I have no friends, no life, no feelings of happiness and I even took up smoking to suppress the hunger. My life is an absolute mess. it's like I'm going off the deep end and don't know how to stop.

My health has started to take a toll and I've been feeling so sick because of my illness. I don't understand why people glamorise EDs when this is the outcome, it's not fun and honestly scary.

Disordered,"Brighter days ahead  Hello all, so I found out about my anorexia about a month ago. My bf has showed concern about it for awhile now, but I always told him I’m fine & I just can’t eat a lot because I get full quick. I guess it’s normal to be in denial about it for a couple years? Anyways, I started PHP this week and I’ve really been struggling with depression and anxiety. Being there, I feel like I don’t belong and find all these reasons why, but I have recently learned that I don’t know shit about shit.    
I must have been really great at hiding it because everybody was kind of shocked when I told them (I mean even myself), which then turns my thoughts to “well they obviously don’t pay enough attention to me” or in other words, nobody cares.
My bf and I constantly argue since being diagnosed. I tell him I appreciate his support and I understand he’s scared, but the “you need to eat more than that” or pointing out my size really don’t help. I feel bad since I can’t help him understand any better and that there is so much to this. 
I don’t really have a community that understands anything about this. I have no friends since i moved halfway across the country four months ago. I just feel so lonely and helpless. 
I am dedicated to getting healthy and doing whatever it takes to get there, but this ed comes with so many strings attached."

Disordered,"I miss actually wanting to eat  I remember when I was a kid being excited whenever I went to my great grandfather’s because he would always have a lot of the best breakfast foods ready for me when I got there and he would always make me a root beer float it was so exciting for me. I can’t remember the last time I considered breakfast food an option. If I eat it’s late in the day just to tide me over until I sleep and as someone who’s prescribed vyvanse after I take that in the morning I feel like I only need to eat like a granola bar. Thinking about eating doesn’t hurt as much anymore just because I now associate things I assume taste good with weight gain immediately and I know it’s stupid but I think I’m more likely to eat trash than food I used to love and I don’t want to eat trash so I end up not eating. I don’t really know where I was going with this but it sucks so much because now even if I try my best to recover I just feel so down the whole time and so disappointed and of course that’s expected but it’s been years of this and it’s not just that I want to eat a whole plate of bacon or a syrup drenched cinnamon waffle, I want to want it again.

Disordered,"triggered by loneliness  This is one of the only triggers I can absolutely pinpoint.

My partner has been having a depression spike and isolating in the bedroom. I usually sit out in the living room because laying in bed reminds me of all the years I spent doing that due to my own depression and ED. However, I am noticing that I feel more and more lonely, and it makes eating less appealing by the day. I don't like eating alone, and my ED has always been a way for me to externalize my feelings.

I'm just so tired of feeling like I don't connect with anyone. Like no one actually wants to be around me. They just happen to hang out with me.

My ED has always been the one constant in my life and no matter how many people try to tell me that they'll be there, I know that they're wrong. My ED is the only ""friend"" that I have ever had."
Disordered,"Considering just a Short Recovery  I really want to do.. like a one week recovery by myself. I know it sounds strange, but I just feel like I'm definitely not ready for any real recovery. I just want to give my body a little break and let myself become healthier. I just want to value myself over my weight for once. And I want to accomplish this so I can feel proud of myself. It's just one week, anyway.

Or maybe a little over a week. But I feel so scared and guilty even thinking about it. My brain is like, ""wow, you're really coming up with any excuse you can to be lazy and just eat all day? Do you realize that you're nowhere near underweight and you're disgusting and you will never ever deserve to recover?"" So, yeah.. I'm just so nervous about it, but I feel like it would be good for me, and also being physically healthier might help make my mind healthier too.

Disordered,"I binged for months, now I regret it [Vent]  Well, it's not even months, it's years...

When people tried to make me eat, it switched to bulimia but then I started feeling so horrible that I decided to try and heal my relationship with food so I could be healthy, but it spiraled in a full blown binge eating disorder. Now, after years of binging and no exercise because of the pamdemic restrictions, I'm almost at the heaviest weight I've ever been at, I feel horrible, my knees hurts all the time and I cry every night. None of my clothes fit now, and I can't even easily find them in syores cause now I'm officially a ""curvy""(?) and where I live stores don't carry big sizes.
While I was gaining weight I was happy because I could finally eat without really having to worry about ""being perfect"": I was in some way trying to recover and I was rven proud of myself. But now I keep asking myself how could I let that happen? How could I bring myself in a situation like this *again*?
I spent ny qhole childhood being overweight and even obese and being heavily bullied for it, that's why I started to lose weight in the first place. Now I look in the mirror and I see middle schooler me crying with me. I'm slowly relapsing, no one really realized it. My relapse started with less carbs and proteins and more veggies and fruit. Im eating almost only fruit and veggies now. My meds make me nauseous and sick all the time so it's helping a lot. I know I should maybe stop myself but I don't want to. I'm slightly obese now and I can't look at myself without feeling disgusted and sad, and mad too.

I don't know if this community does updates on rants/vents, but I felt compelled to write one.

So, long story short, everyone who told me the friend was rather toxic and that I should get away from her—you were right. I'm still confident she didn't know her words were *triggering* me, but I am somewhat sure the things she was saying (related to bodies and food and weight) were... purposely competitive. We parted ways very abruptly after an unrelated fight (where she refused to behave as an adult around a small disagreement & opted on cutting me out of her life instead). However, after parting ways, I realized that she was indeed the problem. And not the sort of person I could bear to be around. My anxiety in general is much more subdued (I used to feel anxious talking to her for the fear she would say something that would trigger me) & the lack of triggering statements is noticeable. To stop before this gets too rambly—you were right & the quality of my life is significantly improved."

Recovery,"boyfriend triggered me after months of not thinking about calories  im babysitting tonight from 5:30ish until past midnight, which means obviously I had to have skipped dinner and waited until I was home to have dinner. 

it’s about 4 hours in and I told him I was pretty hungry and might order some food; so I added items to my cart (something I’d usually get) and sent a screenshot asking him what he thought. he said “that’s a LOT of food. are you sure you can even finish that?? that’s way too much”. 

kind of sat there for a moment and tried not to tear up, because for me, being able to eat whatever I want whenever I want is such a huge recovery step, but this just triggered me so much I deleted the items in my cart as well as the app. the way he worded it made it seem like I was greedy for wanting to eat that much (which was a cheeseburger and a pack of nuggets with chips??).

Recovery,"anorexia lanugo  Hello! I wanted to post here because I need help. I have been anorexic for about 3 years now. I say 3 because I was very very sick during the 1 st year, then I started to ""recover"" for a few months because I needed the energy to study to get into uni, but during the pandemic, I started restricting and exercising heavily again, I am afraid I am going to fall into the same habits again.

I started seeing symptoms of anorexia in the first 6 months of developing it. Lanugo, muscle weakness, bruising, a LOT of bloating, etc. I kind of got accustomed/ got rid of some of these symptoms except lanugo. I don't know what to do with this puff hair on my back, on my arms, and face. I have the biggest problem with having it on my back. 

My sister has always been very skinny, and I always thought that she was restricting, but I touched her back a couple of days ago and it was very smooth and then I started researching why my back was so hairy all of a sudden during the last few years and I found out about lanugo. I want to wear tank tops and camisoles once in a while, but I am very self-conscious about this hair. What can I do to get rid of it? Does it get better if I get healthy?

Recovery,"What scares you about eating?  To preface I want to say you don't have to be scared of food or have any fear foods to have a valid eating disorder. Everyone has different causes to their ED and experiences it differently :-)

But its always interested me what makes different people fear food.

Personally I fear loss of control, binging ect. and only really fear food when I haven't planned to have it. If its in my plan I love to eat!

I have heard many people say they fear weight gain and guilt. But what do you fear?

(P.S. I just find it interesting to note that I usually feel guilty about not feeling guilty and not because of food itself. Anyone relate?)"
Disordered,"cry for help  i suffer from anorexia and try so hard not to body check, but my mom constantly keeps commenting on my body like “uve gained weight” “uve lost weight but only from ur upper body” “ur face is fat so u need to get a haircut that goes w ur face type” and many more. ive told her multiple times not to make such comments but she always responds w “omg, ur so sensitive” “no need to take everything to ur heart”. 
i fight a battle everyday and she keeps making my recovery impossible. i cant move out, i cant work a job and i cant spend time away from home. im at a complete loss bc i dont know what to do. 
just today, i wanted to eat a pizza and when i told her, she said “its only going to make you fat” 
im just so sick and tired of everything. her constantly commenting on my body is exactly what started my ed."
Disordered,"Anyone else got constipated while deep in ED? 🤣  I once was constipated for a whole month and didn’t realize it till 3weeks later, I was like “hm.. every time I go to the bathroom I always pee.. when was the last time I took a shit?” And my reaction to realizing that I haven’t took a shit in nearly a month was like “oh my Jesus fucking christ, Well no wonder my stomach was so big and hurting this whole entire week 🤣 “ it’s funny, you can laugh… 🥲"
Recovery,"Tell me Fitbit is stupid  I’ve started working out more regularly (in a healthy way) and I track most of my workouts via my Fitbit. I know I know…but I haven’t obsessed over any of this stuff in a long time. Well, my cardio fitness score has been steadily increasing the more I workout, and I feel so much better! Until a logged a new run yesterday, and my fitness score dropped literally 2 levels. I’m now in the poor range. It has completely ruined my outlook on all of this and I feel like such a failure. Please just remind that this stuff isn’t accurate and I need to chill out. It feels like the end of the world."
Disordered,Having a hard time w friends  I’m having such a difficult time with others. My weight loss is clearly recognizable and I get met with constant comments about it. I’ve had so many people tell me they’d rather “be curvy than a twig.” I feel like everyone in my circle keeps comparing themselves to me and it makes me so uncomfortable. What’s even more unfortunate is that they don’t realize the mental battle that goes along with it
Disordered,"(afab people) Did your period just completely stop one month, or did it slowly become lighter and less frequent until it stopped?  "
Disordered,"Can we talk about comments?  I’ve been having some concerning liver issues and am scheduled for an ultrasound and gastroenterologist review to rule out anything major. My GP has a history treating eating disorders, but was clear with me that what my tests have been showing are not related to simply restricting because of AN. I’ve gone off medications and while my levels are still high they’re not as bad.

I live with my parents and they’ve been really supportive throughout, but when I mentioned to them I’ve got liver issues they instantly jumped on my restricting and told me my doctor was wrong.

Today they told me they had been ‘researching’ my problems and that I’m probably eating the wrong foods (specifically carrots). I found this really inappropriate - not just the researching, but the comments about what I should or shouldn’t eat, as most of the time they’re not even home to see what I eat during the day. But they’re my parents and I really don’t want to be disrespectful. They are both huge “fix it” people, frequently make comments in an effort to care, and really want me to talk to them about stuff, but I often find myself feeling like there’s no point talking to them anymore because I end up getting hurt and making them upset as a result. I feel like it’s a losing battle."
Disordered,"I want to cry because I’m so hungry  I needed to eat more today to help fuel my morning runs because the past few days, I’ve really struggling and my pace is shit. I still have a significant deficit today, one that would be recommended for non-disordered people. I feel immense guilt from eating so much, but I know I needed it and it’s okay to give my body what it needs. But I am still so hungry. I somehow feel like I didn’t eat anything. I’m so tired of this. Restriction does not become easier the longer you do it. It becomes so much harder. And so much more mentally and physically taxing."
Disordered,"I want to tell my husband I have relapsed, but I also don’t want to tell him at all  I (F30) relapsed two months ago. My husband is no stranger to my eating disorder. He has known about it for years. I told him early on in our relationship. 

But it has not been this bad in years and part of me is like, how can he not see it? But I am a volume eater, so eating a full bag of steamed veggies, cauliflower rice mixed with tuna or tilapia, huge salads, etc. it makes it look like I am eating far more than I actually am. And I will lie and say I have eaten when I haven’t. I think part of him might know, though or maybe is starting to figure it out. The other day he did make a comment about how I’ve been running so much and eating like a rabbit. I of course denied it and said I have been eating plenty. I have lost a considerable amount of weight, still working towards something even lower. My bones protrude far more and I know I probably do look quite thin even if I don’t see it. I look exhausted. I *am* exhausted.

But like all of my other posts suggest, I’m really struggling keeping this to myself. No one in my life knows I have relapsed and I don’t want to tell anyone because I don’t want to be forced into treatment or forced to give up my behaviors. I have been trying to focus more on harm reduction/damage control.

But restriction and over-exercising is making me irritable, exhausted but unable to sleep at night, absolutely killing my libido and personality, and I feel even more weird about being touched now or being seen naked because I don’t want my husband to make comments about if he thinks I’m getting too thin. I don’t want anyone to stop me and I want to keep going.

But how can you be married with an ED when heavily restricting and actively losing weight? Do you openly communicate about it? Do you just continue to live a lie and keep it buried?

I already feel like a burden and I feel like opening up to my husband will make me feel even more so like a burden."
Disordered,"Air conditioning is too cold  Here I am, sitting outside even though there's a heat warning, warming up because the AC won't stop blowing and it's too cold inside. My husband and kids are playing together but I just needed that heat. I know you all can relate. What a crazy damn illness this is."
Recovery,"Just started treatment and its already challenging  Just need a space to vent because my close ones can’t fully understand. Potential trigger: fear of weight gain. 

I don’t know what distorted image I had in mind about this outpatient treatment for my anorexia, that I would just sit there and talk about my feelings without having to make any actual changes maybe? Apparently not the case 😆 Session two was today and the therapist already challenged me to add a meal each day for a week, and to only exercise twice in the week. (Her original suggestion was no exercise, which I couldn’t accept so we negotiated our way to this result.)

She also told me our focus had to be on weight gain. Which I mean, I could have expected that right? Instead, I was weirdly taken a back, had a very visceral emotional reaction to the idea, and cried in my car after. 

Just had to get off my chest this realisation that recovery means effort and work on my part and that no professional in the field can do this work for me, just aid me in the process ❤️

ps: I’m looking for recovery chat pals if anyone is interested, hit me up!"
Disordered,"Want to eat so badly  I've always felt extremely invalidated in my AN because of how much I love food and fantasise about eating it.


Most of my days are spent looking through recipes, watching  WIEIADs and mukbangs and walking through supermarkets imagining buying all the food I want deep inside. I even keep a stash of sweets that I never eat and imagine going into hospital again just so I would have no other option than to eat again.

I feel a lot of people with AN must just have a deep shame around this as I can't imagine I'm alone. But I also wish I wasn't so fixated on food, it makes me quite a boring person. I fear that I am not a real anorexic because I really don't enjoy restricting and would give anything to be able to eat more without losing the 'control' I fool myself into thinking I have."
Disordered,"My dream body didn’t solve my problems  I fell down this stupid Ed hole six years ago and only within the last year I have made active progress to recover properly. 

TW! Bellow starting to talk about unhealthy body image 

My first original  goal was to have a thigh gap. I worshiped the idea of having my legs not touch. My brain thought  thigh gap = healthy and pretty. It got to the point where I didn’t see the point in living if I couldn’t meet these impossible standards that I created for myself.  My eating disorder ruined my time at high school,  as I isolated myself from anyone who would call out my disordered eating.  

I noticed today as I am older I intact do have a thigh gap when I put my feet together. However, the joy that my 12 year old self thought I would feel wasn’t there.  Nothing magically solved itself and people don’t want to be my friend just because my thighs don’t touch. The world doesn’t love me because of a gap in between my legs. 

It’s only taken me six years to realise how messed up my body image was and how stupid it was to throw away opportunity and friendships for my thighs to not touch."
Disordered,"Frustrated and hopeless  My stomach and intestines cramp like crazy 24/7 

They hurt when I don’t eat. They hurt when I do eat. I have a severe fear of vomiting, make it essentially impossible for me to keep eating and I’m terrified to try different foods for fear of how my stomach will react.

And meds don’t help it."
Disordered,"It’s always two steps forward and one step back.. but I feel like I’m waking in cycles over and over again  I’m in a relationship with my current boyfriend he’s been helping me a lot trough our my journey to full recovery. But lately I’ve been struggling so so much and I really don’t know if I can take this much longer, everyone thinks I’m ok now bc I’m eating, but I’m not. They didn’t even bring me to a therapist,Not even once. And it’s getting worse again, my sister has been screaming at me a lot lately and everyone is judging me and telling me how my body looks and saying “that I’ve gained a lot of weight “ it’s making me feel so insecure. 
I’m getting these thoughts again and it’s like I’m going back to my worst. I don’t want to trow away all my hard work but it seems so hard lately, I feel so tired and alone and weak, I want to ask to go to therapy but I don’t want to waist they’re money on me ,I feel like I will never be normal again No matter who is helping me.
I’m such a wreck and a terrible person and I’m sorry that I turned out to be like this and worry everyone, I didn’t mean to be like this and to be such a bad daughter. I make everyone’s life so much harder I feel like I’m a waist of space.
My sister told me that she wishes that I kept going with starving myself and endet it right there and than. It really hurted me a lot bc I did try and take my own life in a couple of incidences but nobody knows about this yet and probably never will."
Disordered,"I can't do this anymore. I think I will brake up our relationship.  Me and the Ed mother 38 of my son (3) had a new fight these days. A fight like all others, that happened a lot in the last months. I tried to love for both of us, tried to remind her constantly about our relationship. We once loved each other. We were and maybe are still soulmates, but I think I lost contact with her. I gave her so many clear statements about my needs in this relationship and that I often don't feel loved. I asked her about her needs, but there is no answer. She admitted and promised to give more effort. Sometimes she forgot our last talks and moved on as usual. And even worse, she recalls our issues, acknowledged my emotions, but she told me she is not able to work with me here, because she doesn't know how. 

I tried to comfort her, make her feel good and tried to be respectful at any time, knowing that it might not be her, but the Ed. I allways had this little dream of a family with her, and she did too, at least verbally. I wanted to cure her, give her her love back, make her feel valuable again.

But she is fading. The mother of my kid. She is a good mother. But an awful partner. She cannot feel any love for herself now, neither for me. 
And I am tired after so many years. I feel stupid and exploited.

I have to take care for myself now, and certainly for my kid, but she has to go her way alone. 

I cannot help her, I never could.

Edit: she had her therapies, but broke all of them. Atm the considers herself as healthy and sees no need for any medical advice."
Disordered,"My parents aren't doing anything and I think I need help  (Sorry if I used the wrong flair btw.) Hello, whoever might be reading this. Thank you for taking your time to read this post. I feel a need to talk about my experience and ask for help, so I came here.
So, it all started in school. We had to stand on the scale, in front of the whole class, and the professor would say our weight out loud. I had been feeling fat for quite some time by then, but I wasn't doing anything about it. When I saw the weight on the scale, it felt like the whole world had just fallen apart. I didn't know what to do. A girl from my class poked me in the ribs and said, ""Haha, I'm thinner than you! You're fatter!"", which just made the whole thing worse.
This was when I started exhibiting anorexic behavior. I didn't know much about EDs back then, I just thought I was working on my body. Day by day, I was losing weight and nobody noticed anything. Or so I thought. My grandma noticed that I ""lost a lot of weight"" and that ""I'm skipping meals"". She made me step on the scale and... I couldn't believe my eyes. I had lost so much weight. I felt so happy. My grandma also commented on my weight. ""You look better now! You're nice and think, just like a model!"", she said with a smile.
That ""complement"" made me go even further. After less than a month, I lost more weight than I did in the previous three month. It was getting out of hand and I knew it.
Once again, I was forced to step on the scale. What it showed now shocked everyone. I was already very underweight. But it wasn't enough. I told myself I was fat and I would constantly look in the mirror and check my weight. Soon, my mom caught up to what was going on. By then I already read some things about EDs and anorexia nervosa, so I had a general idea of what was happening. However, her reaction was far from what I expected. Instead of supporting me and seeking help, she said that I ""better start eating, or I'm going to take away all of the things you love until you return to normal"". I was shocked. I wished I could've just fallen through the ground right there and then. I lost all hope in ever getting better. I thought I was done.
A few months had pased and I still wasn't getting better. My mom seemed to have forgotten (or rather ignored) what had happened. My mental health was getting worse, I started self-harming and I became even more asocial than I was. I tried mentioning it again, or just hinting to the fact that I maybe had an ED. But nobody cared. The same things happened again.
I'm too young to legally get help by myself in the country I live in, so I have to deal with everything alone. My friends have been forcing me to eat something recently and I'm recovering in terms of weight, even though I'm still underweight. I feel like relapsing, I feel invalid because my ED is not diagnosed and not ""severe enough"". But I feel that I need to talk to my parents so I can get help. But they keep telling me that I'm fine, I'm just ""bullsh*tting"" or they just ignore it. I don't know what to do or how to tell them that I need help without them reacting the way they usually do.
Thank you for reading this post. If you have any advice, please comment or dm me if you're more comfortable with that. Thank you once again and have a good day!"
Recovery,"Ultimatum. Don't know what to do..  Today I ate at a Chinese buffet with my friends. My mom picked me up afterwards and we had an argument on our way home.

She got angry at me for not making any progress, for not gaining any weight, for over exercising, for not looking into therapy hard enough and for lying to her about my over exercising. She said I'm gonna die if I don't start trying harder, that I look sick and that nobody wants to look like me. She said I enjoy being sick and that I enjoy being the victim and the center of attention, which couldn't be further from the truth.

But she won't listen. I don't enjoy being like this. I hate being this way, yet it gives me comfort. I'm scared of letting go my disorder. I'm scared of gaining weight. I've been stepping out of my comfort zone and breaking my ED rules, slowly but surely. But it just isn't enough. I don't think I can do it without therapy.

I've talked to some kind of school counselor/therapist and I didn't feel like it helped at all. He made me feel like I'm not sick at all, like I'm choosing to be this way. And that made me feel so confused and upset. I don't know what to do or think anymore.
My mom threatened to put me into a clinic. I'm afraid of losing my job and missing school and my daily life.

Most of all, I hate disappointing my mom. She thinks I'm hurting her on purpose. She must hate me right now.

I hate myself."

Recovery,"what is with my body ?  Hello, i got a Quick question.

I am in recovery since January.

I always got just one meal per day since a long time. So on, 3 weeks ago i tried to get 3 meals per day.
Now i gained 6 kg in 3 weeks; how is this possible?
All my body looks wobbly and chubby. Did i really gained fat that much ? It doesnt feel like fat. Is it a edema? Is it really some water resoration or real fat ? I am in a Drama between my body and my head. Bc my body want that food but my head always tells me i am fat again ( and i know i am in a normal weight atm).
I am so scared atm. Bc i dont understand my body anymore.
Atm with the warm Weather i also can just eat one meal a day; but my body is gaining weight daily. How is this even possible? Somebody know sth ?"

Recovery,"How to support a friend with Anorexia?  
Hi 
Somebody very important to me has battled with anorexia for a very long time and I did not know how dangerous and intense it could be in light of the other things she battles. Recently told her about my suspicions of personally starting an eating disorder with how much weight I've lost recently. I was not self diagnosing, was just sharing a thought and she had a breakdown and cried for a very long time because of how scared she is for my health now. Please can you guys tell me any ways at all that I could help her? Any way I can support her or help her for somebody who knows almost nothing about eating disorders. Should I not talk about it? Should I only talk about it when she brings it up? She is getting really good medical care since her mom is a doc, so what can I do to help her emotionally/her confidence and self esteem? What books could I read to understand this more or sites I could visit? What has helped your friends and family understand your condition more? What are some do's and dont's when trying to support somebody with a condition like this? I really want to learn and be able to support her in what little way I can, even if its just knowing to never talk about it again. 

I'm not thinking about pushing her to recover from this, just want to support in whatever decisions she makes about her body and try help her feel positive about who she is. 

Sorry for this being such a disorganized question, I'm panicking a little. Thank you in advance to anybody who responds, and well done to every single one of you for going through life with something this harsh, you are all amazing in my eyes."
Recovery,"Supporting my partner with an ed  Usually when i see this type of posts its about someone trying to help the one they care about that has an ed.

I want to be there for my girlfriend but my eating problems make it alot harder."
Recovery,What could be causing an inability to gain fat and only gaining water?  My body is replacing/ confusing fat with water so I have swollen legs and fluid around my ankles. What could be causing that? no matter how much I eat I can’t gain any fat I only keep getting extremely painful edema. I also have troubles walking and the more I gain the worse I can walk.
Disordered,"got diagnosed again  Well.. now it's official. I have atypical anorexia Nervosa. Atypical, because my BMI is still in the ""normal"" range. (But I lost 25% of my body weight recently) Over the last few days several mental health professionals urged me to get treatment bc they see how bad I'm doing despite trying to recover on my own. Problem is: I am on waiting lists. It just takes a lot of time before it's my turn. I hate that I'm still at a normal weight. I don't want anything as bad as finally being underweight and it's not that far away anymore. But I'm in recovery and I'm trying to get better and I eat a lot more now, but my mindset is no different."
Recovery,"The part of recovery where the emotion you wanted to surpress come back  I have been inpatient for two weeks now and kind of forced to recover. My thoughts regarding food where more about them not giving me food that either make me sick, thanks mom for never making a lactose intolerant test, or give me sensory overload. Couldn’t even think about calories or something cuz of that. 
Now my body is used to more food and ok if you disregard my stomach pain and diarrhea(thx dairy). 
But now my anxiety, depression and other problems came back full force. 
It’s like my brain was too starved to even feel those now I am scared all the time, can’t concentrate have no motivation and memories come back. I feel numb but a diffrent kind of numb from when I was starving. I don’t know what to do and there are so many things on my todo list and the clinic filled my week plan up to the brim, I feel like I can’t breath.

Disordered,"I don't know what to do at this point  I'm 17 years old, underweight, and a very short guy. I wasn't tracking any calorie intake ever since January, and I didn't notice my weight was starting to decrease every month to the point that I am underweight and I look unhealthy. I used to be fat and insecure about my looks so I started doing diet plans and calorie deficit at some point, but then after a while I stopped that and just returned to my eating habits. I workout 6x a day to make sure I don't gain weight, I do chores everyday and I have a fast metabolism. Everyone is telling me that I look unhealthy and honestly everyone's just dragging how I look at this point. Its starting to get annoying when everyone just says ""EAT MORE"" and I don't even gain weight. I can't stop working out because it's the only thing that keeps me going, I can't stop doing chores because I'm the only one who cleans in this house everyday, and I can't control my metabolism.

Disordered,"do you guys not eat a wide variety of foods in recovery?  I'm trying to recover but I'm eating alot of a certain food. Idk why but it's just safe to me but i worry I'll get fat from eating alot of this food. I do eat other things but i still worry I'm fat, will get fat or am being too picky. Is this normal in recovery or could it be something more this one food is just safe to me and tastes good I'm not terrified to eat other foods but feel less guilty eating this one"
Disordered,Water weight real?  I’ve seen a lot of mixed things online and tbh it really scares me to the point where I won’t drink water and will just drink coffee or something instead (doesn’t really make sense I know).

hello all, i am not currently underweight but i am malnourished. i have a few unpleasant physical effects that are definitely concerning me (heart palpitations, dizziness, etc.) i am finally addressing my ED with my therapist but is there a good way to seek physical treatment for malnourishment only while still seeking out patient help from a therapist? i don’t want to take supplements because i don’t want to accidentally take too much or too little of something, and i think i should get a blood test."
Disordered,"What does ‘recovery’ mean to you?  I’ve noticed that the idea of recovery has a different meaning for everyone who struggles with an eating disorder. For some, it means they stop counting calories or maybe they overcome their binge/restrict/purge cycles. Some people measure recovery by their ability to challenge fear foods or simply by making sure they achieve a healthy weight. 
For me, recovery would mean I stop comparing myself to others and being embarrassed about eating in public."

my girlfriend had an ED before where she lost weight (which actually puts her into healthy weight) but she's struggling to the point now where when she tries to eat, no matter how little it is, she throws it back up. and it's not like she can get professional help either because her parents are aware and they've threatened to send her off to a psych ward or something if it continues. we just feel that she's at such a hopeless point because neither she or i know what to do :( any advice or anything would be appreciated

The only thing that made my diet different from before was the consumption of energy drinks, specifically Reign. I was just wondering if that is something common for people who drink energy drinks, that being hunger suppression and if they are something I as someone who struggles with disordered eating should try to avoid?

My doctor told me that the adderall was probably masking low blood pressure & heart rate bcs of my ed so now my symptoms are more present and to keep nourishing myself. I also recently started an outpatient program that starting today tried to immediately increase my intake more than double and I got even more sick by the first meal. I can’t get through the day at this point and I’m not really sure what I should do? has anyone else been here before??? what do I do???
Recovery,"Weak voice  I rarely eat but drink a lot of water. My voice has been sounding strained or weak for a few days. Is this a direct cause of not eating? I haven’t been talking as often as I used to, so I didn’t know which would be the reason."
Disordered,"I want to cry after seeing the beginning of my struggle with food  I just downloaded an app to count my calories and realised I had an account, and it has kept all my history. 
I’ve just seen exactly when my issue with food started and my weight and what I wanted to weigh and good god it made me want to cry so I’ve ended up walking round my garden

It kept the history of what I searched, what I ate and what I drank. It was from December 2017, I was only 15. This is going to sound crazy but I feel so bad, I wish I didn’t feel the need to do that back then, but here I am 4.5 years later trying to do the exact same thing. 

I know for a fact my mental health overall has gotten worse, I’m at the lowest I’ve ever been. But if I could, I wish I could tell my 15 year old self everything I needed to hear, I want them to be proud of me now and how far I’ve come, but I know that I’d be disappointed. I still hate myself, my body, everything.

On Saturday, TWO DAYS AGO, I had thought I lost a few lbs because my shorts were a little loose but after seeing my short fat stubby thick legs in the mirror I was horribly horribly wrong. It looks like I actually GAINED weight. I’m sitting here crying and so upset. Because everything I’ve been doing, eating clean, fasting, working out, staying hydrated, using electrolytes, doing Pilates , stretching, all for what? To gain weight?

Disordered,"Water Weight Gain?? Help PLEASE! :(  Hey everyone!   


So about a week ago, maybe less, I admitted myself to the hospital because my electrolytes were super out of wack and as I was throwing up after every meal (non-intentionally). That's been going on for months now and because of it, I was losing a lot of weight which made my AN flare-up.

I won't name numbers, but since I've been in here I've gained A LOT of weight. My boyfriend \*has\* brought me takeout like ice cream or pastries with milkshakes and Mc Donalds fries and stuff when he visits (which is like everyday), but I couldn't gain THAT MUCH weight so quickly, could I? I'm sdtill throwing that stuff up sometimes now, but didn't the first couple days so I did process it.

I was on saline for the whole time other than yesterday when they took me off IV. I was getting it pumped into me 24/7 as well as Thiamine and other supplements to try to manage my electrolytes.

&#x200B;

I basically went from eating basically nothing because I was getting sick after I ate, to coming here and having take-out, 3 meals a day (with the help of a dietician), and CONSTANT saline. Could the large  amount of weight gain be caused by that? I'm trying not to freak out. I don't LOOK different other than a really bloated tummy (probably because I'm actually making stool again and have so much water in my system), but my general physic has stayed pretty much the same.

&#x200B;

There's a bit of edema in my legs, and my stomach is really really puffy which is not what it normally looks like.. is that water weight? Please someone reassure me that I haven't gained as much as they're telling me I've gained. (Oh and about that, they'll weigh me on a zero'd hospital bed with my clothes on.. I know it's not accurate. But they're still recording that number. It enrages me so much.

Recovery,"Should I ask her  My step sister is around the age of 16 and she shows some signs of having an eating disorder. She often skips meals, doesn't seem to be eating when she is home alone as no dishes is left around (she wouldn't just clean after herself), if watching a movie she either eats some of a shared snack of not at all, prefers eating in the basement and not at the table, when she eats supper with the rest of the family she goes to take a shower straight after it while normally she goes before going to bed. We are in general quite close and she tells me about her personal life, drama and even her starting s*x life so I feel like if she either trully had it she might have slipped a word to me about it. So anyway my question is should I bring up the subject/ask her if she has one? Because I dont want to trigger it worse or shy her away from asking for help or something...

Recovery,"birth control weight gain and relapse  Hey everyone I'm having the nexaplan fitted this Thursday as I need to have it before I change my drugs (epilepsy) 

A couple of months ago my eating disorder got bad again and to the point I said fuck it I'm recovering well... that didn't go to plan. I was doing alright (not weighing myself, not weighing food, not exercising everyday and I was beginning to feel more in control of food and a bit more confident in my body). 

However in May it got slowly worse and the bad habits kept coming back slowly (I think it was triggered by the news of an old friends suicide which noone had told me about until I googled him).

Ever since my doctor told me that I had to go on nexaplan and told me the side effects and I found other people's experience on it learning about the weight gain has sent me down another little spiral. 

I'm not sure if I can take the weight gain if I have that side effect and I'm not sure how my eating disorder brain is going to cope... as of right now I do semi want to recover but I also know I'm slipping back into the habits again. This time around it's not just me who I'm hurting as my boyfriend has helped me try to recover and my parents are getting more and more suspicious (my parents don't know and I was never officially diagnosed which makes me feel like a fraud especially as I haven't lost that much weight and feel like I'm awful at eating disorders if that makes sense)

Sorry for the ramble and I'm not sure what I want to see as a reply I'm just not sure what to do as especially the week leading up to it I'm panicking and forgetting everything I've done trying to recover"

Disordered,"Atypical A + Stuck  i’ve (18M) been in recovery for a little over two years. At my lowest i wasn’t never considered underweight for my height, so i was stuck with the label of atypical. This was incredibly invalidating to my struggle and has honestly stuck with me ever since. After two years of recovery i’ve started to try to lose weight in a healthy way, as i’m in an unhealthy range for my height and age. but i feel myself, even after this recovery, slipping back into old mindsets and habits. why is it so hard to kick these old thoughts? i have an incredible support system and a caring partner, although he seems pretty blind to my descent back into restrictive eating habits. does anyone else get hung up on these old thoughts when they try to lose weight a healthy way?"
Disordered,Frustrated  I've been in recovery for about a month now but I still miss the feeling of accomplishment that comes w losing weight. also the weird energy feeling that comes when u are hungry.

Disordered,"New friends are on to me…  I haven’t made new friends, who don’t know about my anorexia history since the start of the pandemic. I started birdwatching in early April and I’ve met some lovely new friends through my local bird club. However, I think some of them might know I have a problem. I’ve always worn pretty baggy clothes, but with warmer weather even long sleeves and pants can’t hide what a coat did a few months ago. I get the “you’re so thin” fairly regularly. For the first time since I joined the club,  we went on a longer day-trip that included a picnic lunch together. I packed food and forced myself to eat a bit, but one person, who is a doctor, commented on how little I ate. I’m pretty sure he put it together and now I just feel embarrassed and stupid. I also baked cookies for everyone, which is so obvious, I don’t know what I was thinking. And now I kind of regret putting my self out there to meet new people."

Had rice the other day and I’m Asian so it’s so common for us to have rice but I was eating it after 2.5 years and We eat with our hands so for about a minute I was genuinely so confused what to do with the rice bc it felt so unusual to acc eat it. Made me abit sad bc something that’s so normal for people was just such a huge deal for me

Disordered,"friend said I look “healthy”. Now I just want to starve and lose xx  I saw a friend I haven’t seen in months. She texted me after I left and said “you look good! You look healthy”.

Then she replied, nooo you’re lean as fuck. 

So which is it then? Am I fat and healthy? Or am I lean af? Either way that just totally revved everything up. I’ve already been fasting and restricting and working out, so I guess I’ll just continue and try to lose as much weight as possible. Even if I lost a few lbs, it doesn’t matter because I look healthy still. I want to be underweight I’m sick of being this weight and I want to get past this plataue. I’m not in the recovery mindset, sorry guys. Don’t hate me. I just don’t care anymore.

Recovery,"I've been incredibly depressed and self destructive and now I fear I'm giving myself an ED  Due to many, many circumstances, my life has gone to hell in the past year. I am currently living in my partners house with their mother and her boyfriend.

I have always had trouble with food due to growing up poor. I had snacks during the day and then one proper hot microwave meal for dinner, I've lived this way since I can remember.

Since moving in with my partner suddenly after getting kicked out, my mental health has rapidly declined and I find myself self sabotaging and punishing myself. It has become frighteningly easy to stop eating. I feel like an inconvenience and like I don't have a right to eat their food because I don't contribute to buying it.

My self destructive tendencies make it a vicious cycle where I fuck up something so I feel like shit and get angry at myself and so then I fuck shit up for myself and then I feel like shit and get angry at myself etc.

These new eating habits have only gotten bad the last couple weeks. I know I have to stop before it gets bad but it is so tough, and it's getting worse because I now think about eating and get sick. I know that now I am at a cross roads and I need to stop this self destruction but I don't know how. If I could have any advice or help I would appreciate it immensely. Thank you."

Maybe if I had a partner or something to live for then having an ED wouldn’t be so miserable and depressing. Atleast if I had someone to have sex with that would be nice, or my own apartment that would be cool. The Ed is the only thing I have right now other than trying to save money and heal.

In my country to get the diagnosis of Anorexia you have to bee a certain weight (‘severly underweight’) with your BMI. The thing is like two months ago I had a doctors appointment and she gave me an official sheet with my weight (for my therapist) and at that point I was ‘severly underweight’ and I still am underweight.

Disordered,"No cravings for heavy/sugary foods?  Recently, I haven’t been getting any cravings for sugary or heavy foods, such as ice cream or chocolate, and instead really want to have light, refreshing, “healthy” foods such as fruits/vegetables/salads or a cup of sparkling water. 

When I’m not looking at it, I think how nice it would be to get a bite of something sweet. But the moment I open the freezer and actually see the ice cream, all the cravings go away. 

It’s definitely not about the calories, as I have chocolates that are less than >!30!< cals and I still don’t have an urge to eat it.

Disordered,"How do I make sure my friend is okay eating with me  First off, I hope this is the right place to ask this, since I myself don’t have an ED, but if not please let me know where I can ask this instead. (I also posted this on another subreddit but I’m not familiar with any so I don’t really know what fits.

One of my friends has anorexia and is trying to get help but hasn’t been able to yet. The thing is, he’s staying over at my place in a few days, and we’re having dinner together. However, I’m worried that I’m going to do/say something wrong or act in a way that will make him uncomfortable. I haven’t really been in a situation like this before so I thought I’d ask for advice so I don’t risk anything.

Additional info because I’m not sure what’s important and what isn’t: he probably won’t straight up talk to me about this. He hasn’t been struggling with anorexia for long, I’m fairly sure it’s a more recent thing. He also doesn’t restrict entirely, he eats but struggles to get a lot down when he does, and skips meals if he can. Also I wanted to show him how to do some very simple cooking since I recently learned he doesn’t know how to fry up noodles and such and I thought it’d be good for him to know, but I’m not sure if this is a good idea?

I’m also very sorry if any of this is insensitive in any way let me know, as I said, I’m not familiar with ED’s or a situation like this"

It's not like I intentionally try to eat regularly, or intentionally go back to restricting, though I am terrified of those normal eating days coming back when I'm actively restricting."
Disordered,Edema  I feel like almost for a year now my body is unable to break down fat because my weight dropped too low last year. I gained xxkg in a short amount of time and it is all fluid. I can barely walk and the swelling is very visible and painful. When I sit down it feels like I am sitting on something hard:( and the skin thickened so if you would touch it it would feel like stone. Is it normal that edema lasts almost a year? I am not hitting puberty even though I am overweight now and haven’t started growing any breast at all only the fluid keeps getting more and more. My facial structure also doesn’t change at all which is also a sign that I can’t gain any fat:(. Also I can barely move my knee. Is my body still in starvation mode?

I’ve been trying really hard to keep things “normal” so I eat at least twice a day. I’m losing weight, but not as quick as it used to happen when I had ed habits. So yesterday we were talking and I was telling her I don’t see big change with my body (I still have body dysmorphia), she said she did, but that I would have more success if I change my eating habits, and start giving me tips of what to change. I force a smile through it, because I know she wasn’t trying to hurt or trigger me. But since then I have this se onde me in my head telling me what I should or not do.

thanks a lot everyone ❤️

edit (for those who asked) - i have an assessment with two people from the hospital tomorrow. i’m honestly so scared, after researching the place i know it’s not the best way for me to recover. they focus on weight gain and don’t offer much mental health support, which is weird. i feel like i’d rather recover in the community where i can not only heal my body but also my relationship with food at the same time :("

I have had an ED for a large amount of time by now, so long that I do not remember what it is like without one. 
I struggle with alternating long and painful episodes of binging and restriction, am currently in a restriction episode.

 
I am not ready to recover yet but would like a way to sustain my mental and physical wellbeing that doesn't involve constantly obsessing over what I'm going to or have eaten. 


I have had an NG tube while in hospital, so I am not new to this. My treatment team, however, says NG tubes are for those in IP and I have made the decision that I can not go back as it was a traumatic experience for me personally to be there. 

Does anyone have experience with using an NG tube at home? 
 
I am aware of the rule that nobody here can or should give medical advice, but those who are guiding me medically are not even open to the idea.

Recovery,"A win for me - replacing an unhealthy AN habit with a safer one in recovery  For a while I 'snacked' on Gaviscon tablets, broke that habit a while ago but feeling like I need something to replace that habit while I'm recovering that isn't harmful, but will not send my ED brain wild losing its shit... (which it already is because recovery lol)

I'm also vegan which makes this a bit harder but I just got a box of these 'Mintastic' mints and I think they'll be great, they taste good esp. the sweet strawberry flavour. 

The polyol sweetener they use tends to make me gassy so I know I can't go overboard but I feel happy I've found something with a bit of crunch and flavour that I can nibble on throughout the day, that isn't a fucking Gaviscon tablet lol. 

I'm on a harm reduction recovery journey at the moment, I've upped my intake like 2x (!!!!! and I was never a low restrictor) and reducing my exercise by basically 100% (!!!!!) so it's ***really*** difficult and my ED brain is going nuts *constantly* and I'm just trying not to overload myself with challenges basically (I mean, eating 6x a day is already doing that lol)

so I guess finding something that feels safe feels reassuring, but there's a part of me that's like 'well it's not REALLY recovery is it because you should be having like chocolate bars constantly not little mints' *BUT then* I think hey, I'm pushing so far through my comfort zone already and that's very distressing (but also rewarding! yay for being to focus for more than one minute on my work) so maybe it's okay to do some of these harm reduction focussed things alongside the harder recovery work? 

It's not a black and white matter, recovery, I think it's a grey area and that's really hard for my AN brain to understand...

SO YEAH I'm not sure what I'm trying to say here - perhaps trying to reassure myself (and anyone else trying to recover) that *not every little snack or action you have or do needs to be some epic huge momentous challenge -* if you're already making big strides challenging your ED in recovery then it's completely OK to have some 'safe' things still in rotation, and if that stops you doing something unsafe (e.g. eating a medicine tablet smfh at my old self) then, all the better!

Love and light to you all, recovery is hard. Stay strong."
Disordered,"I want to want to recover (if that makes sense) but I feel like it's not worth it because I don't have any friends  I want to want to recover. Like logically I know that I would probably be happier. I mean I can just compare my overall mood on the days I eat more to the days I eat less. When I eat more I'm generally more happy throughout the day but then cry for like half an hour while falling asleep because of all the guilt/general feelings of sadness™️ that come with eating more. When I eat less I feel more depressed all day, even if I'm happy when I step on the scale. Sometimes I still cry at night.

If I'm being really honest, I think I don't want to recover because I'm not underweight. I was underweight a few months ago, then put on a few kilos and now im losing again. I keep telling myself that I'll start eating more when I'm underweight, but i realize how realistic that sounds coming from someone with anorexia lol.

When I see recovery posts online it seems like so many people say that part of the reason they are recovering is to ""get back their social life"" and there are so many posts of people's ""recovery montages"" (idk how else to call them lol) and in all of them they are usually having fun with their friends. And like idk maybe I'd want to recover too if i had friends who cared about me. I can't help but think that I'll be miserable and lonely even if I recover bc I still won't have any friends yk. Like is it worth it if no one likes me anyway?

I think I'm feeling even more sad now bc summer break started a week ago and my classmates send me Snapchats of them going out and doing things with friends, but im just sitting alone at home. And sure, i can have fun alone too, i can spend time playing piano, guitar or reading, but I just wish someone liked me enough to invite me to their party and I wouldn't just have to see pictures afterwards of everyone having fun without me. It just hurts that no one cares enough. And then of course i start thinking that maybe it would be better if I was skinnier or that I'm clearly not good enough, so why should I bother with eating (like sort of punishing myself).

My birthday is in a few days and I'm turning 16. I won't have a party bc there's not that many people I'd like to invite anyway and I would feel pathetic inviting all the people that didn't invite me to their birthday parties. I am gonna be baking a blueberry lemon cake (with 3 layers guys!!) for my birthday bc i love baking! I hope i can have a bit without feeling guilty about it. Im gonna go to a cafe with my parents and were going to a fun even afterwards that I'm looking forward too. So my birthday is not gonna be awful, I just wish that I could celebrate it for real with actual friends.

Disordered,"being in the clinic shows me how much food I have been avoiding because of trauma but sadly they don’t want me to talk about that  like, I don’t have a problem with the food itself but it reminds me of being yelled at. There will be a brown sauce at lunch and all I can think about is my dad yelling at 4 tear old me to eat it and insulting me. I can hear my classmates yell obscenities at me ‘autist, psycho, unormql unatural’ I remeber them trying to force food down my throat when the sheer taste or texture made me gag. 
but no, they say it’s because of the calories. It’s part of it, now.  But they don’t want to hear me say it started when my dad yelled at me for eating ‘his’ chocolate or how I can’t go to the kitchen or him just yelling at me for anything, making me afraid of even leaving my room for water. Yeah, eventually it also developed to ‘The food is for others I’m not allowed to eat it they’d be sad’.  then I just developed an obsession with numbers and wanted to torture myself by not eating. It was a way to sh after I was caught with other ‘messures’ it happened years after my depression started.  But because I am a couple kilo underweight all the clinic sees is ‘ah yeah they have a restrictive eating disorder’

dont get me wrong, I know I have an ed, and I want to recover but they treat it like it’s the only thing. Some help with how a normal person eats and that I can eat food I like would help, but only forcing me to eat food that is disgusting to me and gives me sensory overload to a point where my sweater was wrong on my skin and I had to get a blanked(fabrics are hard from me it was a sweater that is only ok sometimes) that was comfortable, but no they say it was the calories or the fat.

Disordered,"Question about recovery in general  I think that a. is hard to overcome bcs. it serves as a problem solving mechanism which doesn't solve any problem but rather stands in the way of dealing with it. It more and more becomes a go-to response to many problems and looses, over the course of decades maybe, its causal connection to the original problems. It therefore presents itself as a behavior which is intertvined existentially with the person. Every try to overcome a. means a selfinflicted attack on ones selfimage or identity. 

Therefore I think that neither psychoanalysis nor inpatient treatment (the way I got to know it in germany) are usually successfull in overcoming a. (although I don't argue against either, especially in lifethreatening situations) but rather keeep perpetuating it as it validates the identity (psychoanalysis).

I do believe the most promising avenue is to start behavioral therapy and treat causal problems secondarily.

I am seeing that as beeing painted with a very broad brush, and in no way applicable to all people with a.

As I am not afflicted myself but have decades of experience as a partner of someone with a., I would immensely appreciate your thoughts on this.

Disordered,"horrible mind set  (Not sure but just in case TW not to read if vulnerable to adapting new ideas or habits)

So to put it simply i have started to eat more not because I want to recover from my ed but because it bothers my girlfriend and my mom (I'm 16). Ik this doesn't sound right but its true and hey any reason to get better is better than none. But the truth is I don't want to recover and only get worse as my mind makes me believe that this is what I deserve or that it's good for me.

Ever since I started eating more I am terrified of gaining weight or looking bigger even more than before. So I came up with a long lasting plan not going into detail but main point of it is to wait to be alone to stop recovery once again. This exact plan is what's keeping me on track with recover most of the time knowing that I will be able to go back to all the bad habits later on without worrying people. Ik this is unhealthy but it's the only thing keeping me going at the moment both with recovery and everyday life.

 I'm not to sure what to do as I can't tell anyone about this or my struggles with eating at the moment. The urge to relapse is getting stronger each day and knowing how precious relapses turned out for me this time it might lead me to a hospital or dead.

The biggest roadblock I have hit is eating the proper amount of food and recently it's been worse its so hard for me to eat solid foods to the point I'm feeling extra sick and weak everyday. I have drank ensures to help replace the nutrition I'm losing but I was wondering if anyone had any meal replacement recommendations in a drink form. Thank you in advance I know everyone here is strong and we can all recover with time❤️
Disordered,"Will I ever be better  I ask myself this question often. Will I ever recover? will I know what it is like to wake up one day and not have anorexia? will I know what it feels like to feel happiness and joy without an eating disorder. this disorder suffocates me. pulls me down into darkness. makes me afraid and alone. causes me so much pain and suffering and sadness. there is nothing positive about having anorexia. it changes your personality, your thoughts, your feelings. Will I be one of the people who gets through it? eating disorders are horrible. I wish I didn't have one. maybe one day I will get through the darkness, the pain of an eating disorder. maybe one day, I will know what it feels like to feel better. that day may seem far away, but I still hold hope for the day I can finally feel okay again"
Disordered,"I need help  Hi all,
 
I'm not anorexic but I feel like I'm starting a pattern of unhealthy behavior with my eating and I would like some advice. 

I've gained weight over the past year or so  and I am so obsessed with it that Iook in the mirror constantly, I have recently began cutting out food (like I won't eat until dinner and even then I only eat like half of what I should) and when I do eat more I purge or lately I have been taking laxatives everyday to feel that ""light"" feeling. I've been hiding this behavior from my boyfriend of 2 years (who loves me but because I'm overweight I fear will no longer find me attractive). He asks me if I've eaten and I lie and say I have. A couple days ago I ate a sandwich for lunch and immediately felt guilty and threw it back up. Now I'm punishing myself because I ate a larger meal last night so I won't be eating anything for the next few days. I weigh myself everyday. 

I just want to know if this is something anyone else here has experience or what started their ED? I feel like this is the only way I will lose weight and I'm not starving when I don't eat, I find it really easy to just stop eating. When I eat I feel like I'm just getting fat and I feel ashamed after I do it."
Disordered,How long does it take to slow down my metabolism  I feel like a go to fact when people are trying to get others to stop undereating is that it slows down your metabolism and makes it easier to gain it all back once you go back to normal but does anyone know how long you’d have to be undereating for in order for your metabolism to noticeably slow down. Like if I were to undereat for two weeks then go back to normal-would that damage to my metabolism?
Disordered,"Any tips on how to function at work?  Anorexic of many many years now, and recently I was less uw than usual and functioned quite well even if I have not been weight restored for many years, but now I’m dipping back down to the very dangerous numbers again and I swear I cant manage to function at work. I REALLY really need to keep my job but y’all who struggle know what I mean when I say I genuinely can not control myself right now and I know I won’t be able to put much weight on anytime soon. Any tips at all on how any of you have managed brain fog, fainting, and slowness in the workplace? Any supplements, lifestyle practices, etc. I cant lose my only income"
Recovery,Grateful  My recovery like just started but I’m so glad it started during summer bc now I can go on trips without my ed getting in the way!!! I’m so excited!!!
Recovery,"hey can someone please tell me to go eat dinner?  I know I should but I don't wanna, and I feel like I don't need it (or deserve it)"
Disordered,"(TW!) Being punished for not eating???  So I started getting therapy, focusing on my eating habits, but my therapist doesn't know about my ED, neither does my mom, they just think I have unexplained food restriction or something. Anyway, my therapist suggested that my mom should think of a way to punish me if I decline a meal, is that a real way of helping someone? It sounds so illogical, like do they not think that would lead to a really bad ED? Oh and apparently the therapist specializes in eating disorders."
Disordered,"Health complications due to anorexia nervosa  Just want to know what health complications y'all anorexics may be experiencing as it varies a lot depending of the person. I'm technically severely underweight by the bmi scale and personally I feel no health complications, but my heart rate is very low.

&#x200B;

sorry if this is triggering"
Disordered,Anyone else relapsed/started having an ED when covid hit?  I had issues with eating and body image a few years ago but recovered and was comoletely healthy but once quarantine started I relapsed HARD and havent gotten better☹️
Disordered,I’m finally weight restored  
Disordered,"thoughts after binging, eating for the first time in long  late night binge, my gut health is seriously fucked up and I feel super sick. I've been proud of myself, tired but happy, but now after I binge I see that pink film go away and I truly get a look at my life. happens for a few minutes every time I binge before going back to anorexic thoughts.

I am truly unhappy. 

my life isn't so pink and so nice just because I don't eat and focus on exercising. that's not taking care of myself. but I can't get out of it. I can't eat normally. I can't feel good about how I am. not only in that part, but in general, my life sucks so fucking much. I find no joy in life at all, I just go through these periods of fake happiness that comes from restriction. it's the only good feeling I can achieve.

it sucks so much :( this disorder is ruining my life."
Disordered,"23f, In a situation where I won’t be eating for maybe three or four days and am worried about relapsing after 2.5yrs from bulimia and anorexia.  Edit: why did someone give me this post the wholesome award?  Lol dark humor?

Sorry about this, but my support system is basically zero right now and I need advice.

I finally got the guts and left my boyfriend.  Best decision ever, but I had to leave three days early if I wanted to bring my dog along, so I did and now I’ll be living in my car until Thursday when family helps and then will be on the road with the doggies to a new life in British Columbia.

Couldn’t be more excited, but I’m also so freaking scared. 

I want to go back home, but that’s not wise and it’s over 3 hours away now, so I couldn’t if I wanted.  I can’t goto a shelter because of the dogs.  All I can think about is food and it’s making me feel so guilty.  I don’t know if what I’m thinking about food is right for the first time in a long time.

Scared I’m going to relapse after almost two and a half years.  What should I do to help my emotional state and to help prevent a relapse?  I don’t mean to be dense, but I’m grasping at threads here.  He turned off my phone number and have to use hotspots to even get online. This is all so crazy.

What do I do???"
Disordered,"Third time seeing this ad on different groups. I’m usually quite good at ignoring ads but this one bothered me, especially since I’ve just managed to gain a bit and really trying to ignore that voice in my head telling me I’m now fat 😭  "
Disordered,"hello beautiful and handsome people.  I wanted to post this to reach out to those who struggle and have experience with anorexia. I want to know how to better understand you, support you, and just hear about how you're feeling. If you need to vent, rant, explain anything at all: please do not hesitate to post down bellow. I only want to understand and support. Thank you for reading and I hope you're feeling ok today."
Disordered,"My friend opened up to me about her anorexia. Now what?  Last night my friend opened up to me about her eating disorder, which is rare for her to do as she almost never talks about this kind of thing and I was gobsmacked to say the least. I asked her about it and she told me everything I did my best to comfort her. After we finished talking I went online to learn more about anorexia and was terrified to learn how dangerous it actually is. 


She has a fear of doctors (Growing up, she was never believed about her issues be it family member or friend) so she’s hesitant to go and even if she did want to go I’m sure her insurance wouldn’t cover it anyway (She has other health issues asides from anorexia so you can imagine how much this stresses her out.) 

I don’t know what to do now and I’m worried I may end up saying the wrong thing and make her feel even worse. Thanks for taking the time to read this, what do you think I should do?"
Disordered,I wish i never learned what a calorie was  Does anyone else get so jealous of everyone that genuinely just eats intuitively without having to try? People that don’t know or care how many calories are in their food and just eat what they’re in the mood for then stop when they feel like they’ve had enough. Like I can’t imagine what it’s like to not spend every second thinking about food and planning my meals. And even if I do recover I feel like the voice in my head will never go away. Like I just can’t unlearn these things. Anyways sorry for the vent I just absolutely hate how draining this all is.
Disordered,"Anyone else or am I a bad person?  (Disclaimer: I know this is my ED talking, and so I wanted to warn that it could potentially come off as glamorizing what I experienced. I'm not trying to glamorize it, at the end of the day: I almost died. It's not fun or good.)

I was triggered yesterday and my partner tried to comfort me by reminding me that I'm healthier/stronger, already attractive, not less worthy, etc. You know--the usual go-to affirmations. I tried explaining to him that it wasn't about being attractive, it was about being as sick as possible. That people were nicer and appeared to care more about me and were generally more interested in my being.

What I didn't tell him is how good it made me feel to starve and get smaller. I could defy the laws of nature and survive on as little as possible (until I obviously couldn't). It felt like the closest thing I got to godliness. It wasn't that my ED was fed by the feeling of being less of a person, but by the feeling of being more than just a person. I felt powerful.

And I will never be able to tell him that because I'm scared I sound deranged and self-obsessed."
Disordered,"Does anybody else’s family make fun of their eating disorder?  I’ve heard many people on here talk about how their parents were the cause of their disorder and even encourage restrictive eating/dieting. My family, however, is the opposite. They don’t understand why I would be so anxious around certain foods or feel guilty for eating. Instead, they are always picking on me for what they believe to be a weird obsession with healthy eating. They joke about how I will always get a salad when we order take out or how they “know I won’t eat that” when there is a food I am afraid of. 
I don’t expect or even want them to encourage my eating disorder. But I don’t want to be treated like I’m weird because in all honesty I find my fear of food to be embarrassing as it is."
Disordered,"keto versus calorie <trigger warning>  Does anyone else try and justify their meal between ""oh this is low carb"" and ""this is low calorie""? I find it very difficult to have a happy medium. I grew up with a parent always being on the keto diet so it's been very hard for me to eat bread, noodles, or anything of that nature. But recently I've become obsessed with calorie intake. I'm trying my hardest to keep it as low as i can with out going over a goal that I've given myself. When I'm obsessively breaking down each part of a nutrition label it hurts to either have something low calorie high carb or vice versa."
Recovery,"I'm a healthy weight for the first time in my life and now I can wear cute outfits in winter  I'm so happy, I can wear skimpy revealing outfits like crop tops and t shirts in winter without feeling like I'm freezing to death. I just wanna add that I live in a place with a coastal Mediterranean climate (plz don't wear crop tops in winter if you live in Canada, the parts of USA that snow, Scandinavia, Germany or anywhere else where/when it goes below zero) but honestly it makes me so happy. I used to live in a tropical climate but had to move down here for economic reasons and I miss where I'm from, I reckon I can handle temperatures about 12 degrees colder than I used to when I was anorexic, I developed so many eating disorders during the two years of lockdown and now I'm getting better, people say I look so much better with this weight and people keep asking me if I'm cold when I'm not, I love being able to wear what I want in winter, I hate feelings like my body is being controlled, and now I have more control, I feel so happy"
Recovery,"I’m still hungry (early recovery)  The plan from my nutritionist is pretty low so ny metabolism isn’t thrown in disarray. I’m still hungry though even if it’s a bit more than what I usually ate. I wish I could eat more food but they don’t even allow me to have fruit yet. A bit weird considering I always ate fruit and never stopped, but whatever. 
I hate this I feel extremely hungry, I could eat more without feeling guilty but I’m not allowed to go over my meal plan, I wish I could. 
I feel like I have to retrict more because of my mealplan than I did when I restricted myself. Now I feel bad because the plan said a number of nuts and a tiny bit more fell into my bowl, I didn’t put it back and just ate it anyway, now I’m scared of telling my nutritionist, eventhough my ed is not saying anything. It’s weird"
Disordered,"I want to give up on recovery  (TW) (sh TW)
Recently I have decided to start recovering from starving myself and disordered eating (haven't been diagnosed with an ed but i wouldn't be surprised if I had one).  I didn't want to worry my girlfriend or my mother. They kept telling me how worried they are that im getting worse and ill end up in a hospital or dead if I wont stop starving myself. 

I've been eating more than I used to for the past 2 weeks feeling guilty everyday. Now that I look at myself I feel like everyone was over reacting with my situation and that I wasn't bad at all and could keep going as I did which made the urge to start restricting again bigger.

 I don't like the fact that I feel hungry so often or that I'm not sick after a small meal. It just feels wrong to enjoy food or to actually let myself eat. And the fact that the guilt that I get after eating is getting smaller makes me feel like a failure and made me very sensitive (easily upset). This has lead to me either wanting to over exercise but I'm unable to do so as I'm always tired no matter what I do or how long I sleep. It also made me consider sh (which I tried just a few times) multiple times a day to replace the emptiness and pain I felt when starving. 

I feel like restricting myself again would make everything easier and make me happier and stop the sh thoughts. Just this time to be more secretive about it so the ones that care about me won't be worried anymore. 

I don't know what to do when I want both to recover and to get worse but I'm scared of gaining weight and don't want to worry anyone."
Recovery,"it’s amazing what nutrition can do :)  i was put into an inpatient unit a few weeks ago, and before this i was ADAMANT i was never going to recover and that i never wanted to. it’s so crazy to me how fast my mind changed as soon as i was forcibly being given the right nutrition! i’ve turned it around completely and i hope people that are really struggling know how horribly deceptive eating disorders are and how starving can effect your brain!!"
Recovery,"Anorexia extreme hunger  hello I’m currently inpatient & kinda relapsed regarding my eating disorder.
But I started eating again & I feel like I can’t stop.
Honestly I’m not ready to gain weight yet but I’m trying to not go lower than my current weight.
But I’m totally freaking out bc I’m starting to feel like I’m losing control bc right now I’m eating a lot more than I usually do & still don’t feel full. It’s also really difficult for me to stop myself from eating. 
I haven’t gained any weight yet but I’m still freaking out thinking I’ll gain so much more. I already feel really heavy.
Even though I eat a lot more  I feel awful, extremely nauseous, light headed & don’t have any strength.
I don’t know what to do.
(I’m not inpatient for my eating disorder but other things)
Is this normal? What shall I do. I feel like I’m losing control"
Recovery,"feeling hungry after eating in recovery  so i guess ive been in recovery for a while now and it wasnt really planned or anything but i just ended trying it because of exams that i didnt want to mess up. ive had a lot of slip ups but overall id say its much better from when i was heavily restricting, and i was just wondering why i feel hungry everytime after i eat but not so much before? some days i could go without feeling hungry at all the whole day and then other times i eat even if im not hungry and then start to feel hungry after. ik it may be messed up hunger signals but i thought these would have been fixed by now since its been quite a few months and all of the other symptoms are gone, google keeps saying there might not be enough protein etc in the meals but thats not whats wrong since i make sure theres everything:( sorry for the rant! its just been going on for a while now so i was wondering if anyone knew why this was:)"
Recovery,"people 23+ with ana??  i’m 24, and all the ED content i consume (reddit, youtube, etc.) is just full of teenagers. and most college age. and i feel so pathetic that i’m an adult with anorexia. is anyone else over 23 in the same boat?? i’m desperate to know i’m not so pathetic that every adult has recovered but me. i know i should have outgrown this by now. i remember thinking when i was a teenager “i can’t wait to grow up because then this won’t be an issue anymore.” and yet here i am. 24. worse than i’ve ever been. flirting the line with forced treatment. and teenager me would be so heartbroken to know that this is how we turned out."
Recovery,"shame in recovery, 4th day of recovery  I have been put on a refeeding plan and while I see the need (refeeding as in, the goal is not yet to gain weight but to slowly increase calories to a point where I can gain weight to not develop refeeding syndrome) I have to be honest and say I sometimes or many times had slightly more than the plan alowed. By more than the plan alowed I mean liquid calories because I put milk into my tea. We have soy milk too and sometimes I took the vanilla or choco one which has sugar (safety: I can’t have to mych sugar). now I’m feeling guilty because I went ‘against the rules’. While at home I always avoided sugar in milk and bought the sugar free option they don’t have that here.  My ed does not really care in itself but it cares because it thinks it has an extra reason to not allow me to have that milk. 
But also black tea with milk is such a comfort drink for me and I need that with everything else.  I doubt it be too dangerous but yeah
idk what do you guys think"
Disordered,"I don't have anorexia but idk I think I might be on the verge of it?  So I enjoy eating food it's kind of like a guilty pleasure of mine. But here recently I've noticed I've gained weight. When I look in the mirror all I see is my round belly and I'm disgusted by myself. I keep telling myself ""now today you're not going to eat anything because you need to lose weight"" but then I always end up eating because I have no self control. And since I didn't have control over my eating I go and cut myself. It's like this endless cycle of ""don't eat, eats and then cuts self"". I don't know how to stop it but I was actually able to go a day without eating and I felt super empowered like I had overcome and defeated some hard boss in a game. It was amazing feeling. Of course I over ate the next day which completely ruined that euphoria. But I'm worried now since I made it through a day without eating, am I going to get worse? Will I eventually go days without eating? Or just eat barely anything each day? I honestly don't know what's worse -starving and not cutting or being fat and cutting..."
Disordered,"ASMR Food Videos  Anyone else get insanely angry at those videos? Like the cute Chinese girls who eat random snakes, live seafood and ridiculous amounts of food? It's not the video so much, but the noise makes me so angry/disgusted/I don't even know. 

Hearing people eating has always disgusted me but the ASMR is a whole other level. Irrationally angry level. I don't want to use the word 'triggered' but yeah."
Disordered,I need help  I’m scared to gain weight again. about two years ago I stopped eating because my parents pushed dieting on me. I did loose weight but I was miserable. I still hate myself and i still felt like a fat kid. It took a long time to finally recover and I finally started eating a healthy amount again but I noticed i’ve gained weight. i’m still in high school and I really don’t like how I was treated in middle school befor my ED so i’m scared that if I gain weight people will treat me differently and i’ll spiral back into anorexia. My parents consider my ED a success story and I feel like if I don’t loose the weight i’ll be a disappointment to them. Please I just need some advice or motivation. I’m scared and i don’t want to go back to that dark place i was in.
Disordered,"Second go of puberty  Okay odd one here; so I’m a 21 year old male. I’m basically wondering if anyone has experienced kinda like a round 2 of puberty, I’m praying I can rescue
 my testosterone somehow and bring it back up since I’m still young enough (have had an for 2 and 1/4 years). Has anyone experienced similar feelings and physical mental changes such as when going through puberty, upon recovery? I love lifting and I have finally stopped because I’m fully committing to recovery and I want to be able to lift when I’m recovered again too, and testosterone plays a role in building muscle"
Disordered,"I don't wanna recover, as sick as that sounds.  TW!!

No matter how much I stare at myself in the mirror, no matter what my family says, no matter what my friends say; I'll always be fat. 

I wish that I could just stop eating. I've stopped before and have thrown up the food I have eaten, but it hurts so much to heal from that. I want it again so I don't feel fat. I want it again so people bully me for being too thin. I'd rather die than be fat. I want to starve again, but my family forces me to eat. Now I can't stop. I hate the full feeling in my stomach. I just want it to be empty. 

I'm just going to give up and not eat. No matter how good food looks, I may just eat one meal, maybe even none. I'm so sick of the pain of being fat. I'm sick of my fat thighs, my weird bulging stomach, and my thick face. If anything, the impact of it is the only thing that has stopped me over the years. 

I'm just not going to eat anymore. I can't take it. 

I've been like this since I was 8. I'll never be the same again. 

I hate how I've recovered, so I'll start again.  Even if I'm eating small meals, that's better than big ones. I hate it so much. I just want to love myself. This is the only way."
Recovery,"Feeling like a fraud.  What it says on the tin, basically.

Been in a recovery attempt for probably 4 weeks now? Trying not to keep track.

Eaten so many fear foods but more scarily than that, eaten consistently throughout the days, 3 meals and 3 snacks, way above the usual kcal amount I'd usually allow myself.

I just kinda now feel... like a fraud. Not valid. Not worthy of recovery. Like I should move towards relapse by high restricting and then gradually going back down (from previous recovery attempts I know I can't just go from this to what I was doing before; I'll get that ravenous, insatiable hunger again, it always takes time to taper back down which seems unfair given how easily I can skyrocket up to eating massive amounts of food).

Idk what I'm doing with this post. Just feel alone with it."
Disordered,Do relatives have nothing to talk about but weight gain and dieting??  I love my family but if I hear one more person point out the weight that I gained and turn it into a whole conversation on how we all should start eating less because that’s the only way to lose weight I’ll consider committing familicide
Recovery,"Tips to make food in a ed clinic more bareable(tastewise): making grainy yoghurt smooth  don’t mix the yoghurt, try to shake it. That way you can get smoother yoghurt idk why exactly and it sounds a bit stupid but I just tried it after a patient suggested it and it was a hell of a lot easier to eat and tastier. 
Do you guys have any other advice?

disclaimer: I’m speaking soley of the taste aspect not anything related to ed thoughts specifically. Obviously we are ‘forced to eat’ in a clinic to get our nutrients but sometimes that food can just be disgusting especially if, like me, you are a picky eater and sensitive to taste or texture"
Recovery,"Side Effects of Recovery, Help!  Hi everyone. After 8 years of ED, I started recovery 6 months ago in January. After getting back from a business trip a month ago, I started to forget to eat and log my meals that helped me during the first 5 months. I was more focused on my grandfather who had cancer and passed a week ago. Now I am trying to catch back up, but I am having a chronic migraine for 26 days now and extreme hunger pains, both of which make me not feel like eating due to the pain. Has anyone had a similar experience and have any tips to get back into recovery while battling the side effects of relapse? My doctor nor family have any helpful recommendations beyond Just Eat so I need a little help. Maybe methods for eating? Ways to stop the migraines? Ways to eat while working 16 hour days? Exhaustion prevention? Thank you so much, love you all."
Recovery,SSRIs/ medication  Does anyone here have experience with taking antidepressants or meds for AN? I’m terrified of gaining but I have almost no joy in my life anymore so considering going back on SSRIs. Did you gain weight on them?
Disordered,"Want to semi recover? (TW)  Ok so, my tongue started feeling really painful because of all of the purging. I looked on my tongue and found a little black spot. I started freaking out. So I immediately went to google and got even more scared. Eventually I rationalized one of two possibilities. 1. It was purge related 2. It was smoking related. Neither of which my mom could know about.
Since then I have been brushing my tongue in that area and it seems to have gone away. But that was definitely a wake up call. No. More. Purging. Plus! I’m also a singer! And can’t have ripped up insides and smokers lungs. So, I threw all my vapes in the trash and haven’t purged since. ( Weirdly enough I don’t think I ever got addicted to vaping despite the amount I would do it? I don’t think I ever made the correlation between nicotine and mood, I kinda just used it as a suppressant ). I just don’t think I’m ready to recover from AN. But I really REALLY wanna recover from BN and purging. Anyone else have the same problem? Or just any tips on how to stop purging? Also, I know it’s not much, but I’m 2 days purge free and really happy about it."
Disordered,"I hit my UGW. What now?  (First post) I hit my ugw yesterday. I feel accomplished, but not as thrilled as I thought I would be. After being disordered for almost a year, health problems are creeping up on me recently. I.e raynaud’s, chest pain, dizziness, brain fog, joint pain, etc. Although not easy, I am likely going to end up maintaining this until my 21st birthday later this month and then maybe try to get some help. I’m very nervous about that because I have not gotten any mental health treatment in many years and quite frankly, I don’t want/don’t feel I deserve to get better. Like most people my Ed is co-morbid and I don’t want to open that box. I am barely able to admit that I have an ed to myself and saying it publicly for the first time here makes me feel like a fraud. Apologies for rambling and maybe I will post an update sometime."
Disordered,"Shakiness and funny feeling chest anyone?  I have been dealing with AN for about a year now after gaining the “freshman 15”.  For the duration I’ve been mostly restrictive but I’d sometimes try to recover and relapse. Right now I’m in the state of a relapse.

Anyways, i have been experiencing a weird feeling in my chest as well as what i can describe as cold sweats and shakiness in my legs and hands. I don’t know what to do at the moment. Any thoughts?"
Disordered,ate ate and ate  i ate above my BMR i cant breath and im sobbing i think i having a panic attack can someone pls calm me down i didnt mean to eat that much it just happened:(

Disordered,"Fear Foods  I used to be super scared of carbs and protein and anything besides fruit and vegetables, but now it's the other way around. I'm really scared of fruit and vegetables because I feel like it's too much sugar, and all I really eat anymore is carbs and protein."
Recovery,"Recovery help and tips.  I'm nearly 17 and I have been struggling with eating for a couple of years now to the point of feeling like farthing everyday. I haven't been diagnosed with any eating disorders but I do have alot in common with them (especially a typical anorexia) while not trying to self diagnose. It got really bad recently nearly ended up in a hospital so I decided to start eating more and weigh some weight.

If anyone has any recovery tips or information that I may need to know or maybe something that no one seems to mention it would help me alot and maybe a few others who read this post. 

Also if anyone could explain what weight gain after restricting for a long time might look like would help too. Any even especially the discouraging from recovery facts are welcome as they'll help calm me down and not relapse once again.

 Thank you"
Recovery,7 Days binge free !!  I'm so happy rn bc I haven't gone a week w/o binging in so long. I don't even know if its real binging or just like reactive eating from restriction but either way I'm rly proud of myself.
