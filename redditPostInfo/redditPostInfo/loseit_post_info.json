[{'Disordered': 'Healthy and safe amount of weight to lose in a month?  Hello everyone.  I’ve been on this weight loss ride since about mid March and am down about 50 ish pounds.  Still considered morbidly obese at 330~.  I’m a 6 2’ 28 year old man for some context.  In the month of august I really stepped up and started meal preping not just my lunches but my dinners and making my breakfast the night before too.  I count calories and weight out all my food.  I go the the gym 4 times a week and I’m fairly active at my job and in my free time.  I have a rough number in terms of calorie intake and it’s between 1600-1800 depending on the day though I do tend to be a bit more forgiving on the weekends.  My question is how much weight would be healthy and safe to lose in a month?  In august I lost roughly 11 pounds.  I’m hoping to do the same or better this month.  I understand being morbidly obese you can lose weight pretty rapidly if you really buckle down but I don’t want to go so fast that I get sick or hurt myself.  I’ve lost and gained weight my whole life but this time I’ve actually made the conversion to a whole life style overhaul oppose you just moving a lot more.  Any advice or input?  Anyone been in a similar situation?  I know this rapid loss of weight won’t last forever.  I just want to do it right.'}, {'Disordered': 'Shredding advice • Comp in 12 weeks  \nI have never been very confident and am going outside of my comfort zone in order to grow.

I\'m not sure when it happened but I have been having regular appointments to have an unrelated drug injected subcutaneously into the same area, which characteristically forms a lump, however it disappears after two weeks and I haven\'t had one there for 5 weeks, I\'m wondering if the nurse accidently pierced my abdominal wall with the syringe and then it only took a bit of strain for the intestine to slip through.\n\nI\'m starting to think I may have to completely change my diet via "crash weight loss" just so I will be able to know for sure. I\'ve already been practicing 1 meal a day for 7 months so discipline with food isn\'t an issue..

Solid food going through my intestines seems to be uncomfortable and I am genuinely worried about making it worse if I try and have a #2. Getting a doctors appointment in my local area is also a farce at the moment, and hospital appointments even more so. And even then from what I gather they won\'t even do surgery on someone with a BMI over 25 so it could be a long wait if I don\'t make some immediate changes. \n\nDoes anyone here have experience with Hernias and weightloss?

So I am 26 (F she/her) and I’m looking for some advice. I posted a few weeks ago to get peoples thoughts on weighing yourself every day since I have barely weighed myself at all in the past 10 years but have felt myself putting on weight this past 2 years. So this morning I weighed myself for the first time in about a year and a half and I was 80kgs. This is the most I have ever weighed (I’m 170cm) so it was a bit jarring as I’ve always hovered around 60-65kgs but I know I’ve been through a lot this past two years so I’m not gonna let myself get too down about it.\n\nKnowing the number is actually quite motivating because now I feel like I have a bit more of a way to measure my progress and keep me on track. I would like to get back to around 63kg in around 6 months because I know that is a healthy weight for my frame and when I felt most confident in my body. \n\nI have some healthy habits already. I work out 3-4 times a week most weeks (on a less active week I’ll still work out 1-2 times) and on average i do around 13k steps a day (I’m in retail and on my feet a lot) so I’m pretty active. My workouts generally consist of around 20-30 mins of cardio and 30 mins of weight training if I go to the gym but if I’m just at home I’ll either go on a long walk or short run. I also do 1 body combat class every week with my friend. I used to be really into weight lifting between the ages of 20-23 and although I don’t train as much as I used to I’ve maintained most of my strength, so I do think a lot of my weight is probably muscle although there’s definitely fat there too 😅 \n\nI know eating is where my downfall comes from. Again, i have some healthy habits and will usually have a soup or salad for lunch but I know I am definitely guilty of having pastries/banana bread too often for breakfast, a sweet beverage during work(bubble tea or hot chocolate are my fave), eating out way too much and I love an after dinner dessert or 2 lol… dinners can also be difficult as my partner is always trying to bulk up and wants to eat a lot of meat and carbs and I generally cook for both of us. I’ve also been drinking alcohol a lot more so I’m trying to cut back on that now too. I am calorie conscious but if possible I would prefer not to count calories as its taken me into very unhealthy thinking patterns in the past.\n\nSo now you have an overview of my situation I was wondering if anyone had any helpful advice, tips, apps, recipe sources or words of motivation to shared.

I played sports in college and while I’ve never been thin, I was absolutely in shape and felt great. Since graduating in 2012, I quit smoking, got married, had two babies, and went from 160 lbs to 240 lbs. \n\nI maintain that the biggest factor in my weight gain is constant hunger. I have been ravenously hungry for years, and I just came to accept it. I would wake up starving, eat breakfast immediately, and start planning lunch. Would have to force myself to wait as long as possible to eat lunch, and would normally cave by 11am. Then be eating snacks all afternoon. Then a huge dinner - eating portion sizes as if I hadn’t eaten anything the entire day, because that’s how it felt.\n\nI would get so discouraged when I would hear people say things like, “Just eat when you’re hungry!” But I’m ALWAYS hungry. “Eat intuitively.” My intuition makes me eat all day.\n\nEarlier this year I finally sought professional help with my weight loss journey, and after going through a 6 month program with them and only losing 8 lbs, my doctor sat me down and asked if I was interested in taking Metformin. At first, I was really scared, because I thought she was telling me I had Diabetes, but she told me I didn’t. But she did seem to think that there was a chemical imbalance causing my hunger, and metformin might help. I started the pills a week ago, and today, I felt…different.\n\nI woke up for the first time in years not thinking about what I was going to eat for breakfast. In fact, I wasn’t concerned with breakfast at all until about 8am. I had a couple of eggs, was satisfied (never remember feeling that before) and went on with my morning. Didn’t even think about eating again until 1:00, when I ate my lunch, and didn’t finish it all. I had an actual normal, portion size, and again, felt satisfied, and put the rest away. Again, I didn’t even think about food until after I got home from work. I made my family dinner, and for the first time EVER, I didn’t return for seconds.\n\nI didn’t consciously TRY to do any of these decisions, they just happened. It’s like the hunger demon that has possessed my body went on vacation. I was able to focus on non-food related activities the entire day, which up until now seemed nearly impossible for me.\n\nI know I still have to put in the work of increasing activity and making healthy food choices, but for the first time in my adult life I feel like I actually have a chance at controlling my weight.\n\nHoping to hear other people’s metformin experiences; the good, the bad, and the ugly.'}, {'Neutral': "Excited for the good food  A while back, I posted that I lost 5 lbs with IF, working out, and CICO.

Hey y’all I made a few posts here in mid august (around the 14th) and I figured I should update y’all.\n\nI started by counting calories, and I did that for a few weeks before it became to much work… but I still check calorie facts and try to stay within my caloric limits. I also discovered it’s the calories that are harder to measure, that you usually go over on. For example, 2tbsp of the cream I use for my coffee is 70cal, but it’s really not a lot of cream, and I can’t drink black coffee anymore. So if I just creamed my coffee to taste, I’d probably have an extra couple hundred calories unaccounted for if I didn’t measure it. Same goes with cheese, or cookies, or ice cream, or that dinner somebody else cooked. So the way I usually get past that is over assuming caloric amount, and saving calories for when I can’t do any educated assumption. My goal caloric intake is under 2400, when I was counting (still eating around the same amount) I would only eat around 1800cal which gave me enough leeway with what I eat. \n\nI was weighing myself every week but now I usually forget, and that’s probably a good thing.

I weighed myself last week and have since gained almost 30lbs since I last weighted myself 2 years ago. I am freaking out and don’t know what to do.  \n2 years ago I hated myself. I had been dieting for over 10 years at that point and still hated my body. I weighed myself everyday, was so food focused, lived everyday waiting for my next meal and wanting to go to sleep in order to wake up and weigh myself in the morning. \n\n2 years ago after fighting with myself for years, I  finally decided that enough was enough and stopped weighing myself and counting calories. At this point I loved working out, and knew that I had enough knowledge from years of disordered eating to understand how to take care of my body in terms of mental and physical food needs. It was the best decision I ever made. \n\nI started slow by still weighing everything I ate but just guesstimating, then I stopped weighing everything and just guesstimated for a while and then eventually I stopped guesstimating all together and just lived. I started to genuinely look on the mirror for the first time and was happy with what I saw more often than not. I definitely still struggled, but I at least felt good/decent 60% of the time.  \n\nI kept saying to myself there is always something I’m going to want to change this is good enough I am good enough. As the months went on I became more and more relaxed with my eating. Still having healthy meals, but snacking, indulging have a good time and not obsessing about it by any means. I looked in the mirror and didn’t see a difference at all.\n\nI weight train multiple times a week, walk a lot as I live in NYC, love dancing and just being active so I thought that I remained the same weight. Last week I went the doctor and asked her to not tell me my weight as I usually do. She didn’t tell me, but later on when I looked at her screen my BMI was 29 which shocked the hell out of me. I was like that can’t be right. I foolishly looked up how much I had to weigh in order for my BMI to be that high and was horrified. When I got home I weigh myself for the first time in 2 years and read 177 on the scale. That is the heaviest I’ve been in 4 years. It honestly shocked and embarrassed me. I felt so comfortable in my skin thinking I was almost 30lb lighter. I don’t know when I gained this weight I don’t know how long I’ve been maintaining either or if I’ve just been slowly gaining over time. \n\nRegardless I Don’t want to gain anymore. This has sent me on a tail spin. I feel so anxious when I’m eating now and don’t know what to do. I was happy with my body before but I don’t want to continue gaining weight. I didn’t notice the weight gain, but my friend said that they had.  They said that I am fuller, but I am so much happier and more full of life than I ever have been. \n\nI don’t want to be almost considered obese though that’s not healthy for anyone . I am so embarrassed but I don’t know how to go about this. I would be dieting to pretty much change the number. I don’t plan on weighing myself again for a long time, and I am still okay with how I look but now I am picking myself apart and suddenly feel so huge. I feel more unhappy with my weight and like a fraud. I feel so so embarrassed, scared, and hurt. \n\nI don’t know how to do this. How do I go down this road without it becoming toxic, unhealthy and obsessive? My stomach has always been a huge insecurity of mine even through this period of self love. It has never been flat or small even at my “smallest”. My Ed brain is going crazy, I am shaming myself left and right and so uncomfortable. I want to be healthy but I thought I was. I feel like shit.

I've been reading a bunch of posts about calories in/calories out, but I haven't seen a whole lot about nutrients, so I wanted to share what little I know.

Don't be discouraged, men and post-menopausal women, these tips apply to you too!\n\nHere are 3 easy ways to absorb more nutrients from your food (which will hopefully mean your body requires a lower intake for the same amount of nutrients):\n1. Cooked veggies: the body absorbs nutrients in cooked vegetables better than it does those in raw vegetables.\n2. Don't multi-task! I know we all love to work through lunch or eat on the go, but that's not helping your digestion! A point these ladies make is digestion starts in the brain, and when we're focused on the task of eating, our digestive system functions better than if we're eating while doing something else.\n3. Enjoy your food! This one was most fascinating to me. Listen to the episode for full details, but I'll try and break it down for you. \n-A study was done with 2 groups of women: Swedish and Thai. Each group was fed a meal from their respective culture (for Swedish, think meatballs, potatoes, whatever vegetables Swedish people eat, and for Thai, think fish and coconut and some Thai vegetable), and then each group ate the other group's meal. \n-What they found was the Swedish women absorbed more nutrients from their homeland meal than the Thai meal, and the Thai women absorbed more nutrients from their Thai meal than the Swedish meal! \n-As a control, they served each group their respective meals, but pureed in a blender, and neither group absorbed many nutrients for those nasty smoothies.\nThe point here is they found that when these women enjoyed the meal they were eating, they absorbed more of the nutrients from that meal, and you can do the same! Maybe don't constantly eat meals that gross you out just because you know they're good for you; try and find recipes that are good for you *and* that you'll enjoy.\n\nGood luck out there, everyone!"}, {'Recovery': 'Why is Noom so hated?

I\'ve got fat genes,” I concluded.\n\nIn 2014, my diabetes was getting harder to control and managing travel with insulin shots and pills was difficult. Too little medication would keep my blood sugar high and do long-term damage. Too much medication would result in low sugars and cause confusion and blacking out.  These meds were maxxed out. I was referred for gastric bypass surgery.  \n\nAs homework, my would-be surgeon recommended a 3-week program that included tracking my food and walking.  This worked very well. I was down 19 pounds and I was stoked! The homework was over, but I continued to log food and walk.\n\nTwo weeks later, I felt hot, confused, weak, and somewhat sick. I began to have low blood sugars, as if I was taking too much medication.  Five weeks of weight loss from walking and food logging had improved my glucose situation. Soon, my doctor dropped all my insulin and pills. It was at this point that I decided that I was going to pause the surgery and commit to continuing my program for a year.  \n\nTo support me on the journey, I joined TOPS. It helped cement the idea that these changes that I am making aren’t a temporary diet but a lifetime of habits towards reaching and maintaining a healthy weight with a healthy lifestyle.

But also, alcoholism runs in my family, so I\'ve always randomly dropped it for a month or more at a time, just to kind of prove to myself I have a handle on it. This time it\'s less about that, and more about losing weight. Alcohol is empty calories, but worse, a drink or two at night makes it *really* hard for me to get myself out of bed at 4:30 in order to have time to work out every day.  \n\nI do allow myself a drink or two on Saturday nights, since I don\'t work out on Sundays. \n\n2) "Healthier Food" -- Just really focusing more on eating things that provide nutrition, and trying to avoid empty calories. I counted calories for the first few weeks to kind of get an idea of where I\'m at, but now it\'s more just being aware of portions. My Achille\'s heel has always been late night binge-snacking. I\'ve had a few "bad days", but way more wins than losses. In order to get up early enough to work out, it also means I basically go to bed immediately once we put my daughter to bed, which takes away that "free time" where I tended to fall prey to mindless snacking. \n\n3) Working out -- I have a few sets of resistance bands, and so I devised a 5-day strength training regimen: Upper Body, Lower Body, Core, Upper+Lower, Core+Cardio. Each routine is about 30-45 min. On day six, I do about an hour of cardio. Long walk/jog/bike ride/elliptical/whatever. It\'s nothing too elaborate, but I\'ve noticed improvements already. \n\nReally the whole thing hinges on the workouts, because doing those forces me to do the first two things. I weigh myself daily, but I\'ve had enough experience with the scale to know fluctuations etc mean the specific number on any given day doesn\'t mean that much. Mostly it just lets me watch the overall trend. \n\nI had hoped to at least see a sub-190 weigh-in within a month, but that\'s not yet happened. Instead, my weight\'s gone from fluctuating anywhere between 194 and 199, to between 192 and 194. So the average did move down, and also the amount of fluctuation seems to be narrower too. \n\nThat said, when I hopped on this morning, after not a particularly great day yesterday (we had an event, so dinner was pizza and there was a slice of cake), the scale briefly flashed 189.2 before landing on 190.0. So it\'s close!\n\nAnd even before that, it hit me that looking at the "average" weight, I\'ve lost about a lb per week, and while slower than the 1.5-2lbs I\'d kinda hoped for, it\'s a really healthy pace, and hopefully means meaningful gains instead of that fast-to-come, faster-to-go stuff. \n\nWith about 22 weeks left of my initial experiment/commitment/whatever you want to call it, at just 1lb a week average, I\'ll still be a ways away from my goal weight, but I\'d be at my college weight, and that\'d be pretty damn cool too.'}, {'Recovery': 'Today I did something I never thought I would.  I should preface this by saying I am not at my goal weight yet. I’ve lost 15 pounds in about two months, and I’ve got about 70 to go. However, I’m feeling solid in the habits I’ve built and the changes I’m making. Very solid.\n\nI had to start with all that so you would understand that this is a real 180 for me. Back in 2016 I was at a very healthy 140, and then following a several year battle with severe depression in combination with PCOS, and I put on 85 pounds and kept them. Since then I have refused to get rid of any of my old clothing because that felt like quitting. So for years I have had an overstuffed closet filled with clothing I could not possibly wear interspersed with other clothing that fits me now but I don’t like. Half of the clothing from years ago is stuff I would never wear even if I lost all the weight, but I still couldn’t stomach getting rid of it because that felt like accepting defeat. I know it’s irrational to keep clothes that don’t fit and I don’t like regardless, but I just couldn’t make myself do it.\n\nWell, this week I went through all of my clothes and have purged about half of them. Some things that fit me now but I don’t like that much, and some things that will fit me soon enough but I will never want to wear again. It feels so good, like I’m affirming my commitment to the changes I’ve made. Even though I’m only at the beginning of the journey I can feel it in my bones that I’m changed this time. It’s in my heart and my head, not just on my body.

Ok, this might sound like a very odd question, but hear me out-\n\nI know a lot of people seem to have a hard time maintaining long term weight loss (me included), and I believe this is mainly due to an decrease in leptin and an increase in ghrelin over time. Leptin levels are controlled by your fat cells, and I believe ghrelin correlates with this as well. \n\n(Please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm by no means an expert on this, and always trying to learn more about how the human body works!)\n\nBecause fat cells never dissapear (or at least not for a very long time) and only shrink, the more lean you become the more your appetite increases. \n\nSo is the reason people tend to be more hungry after losing weight due to the empty fat cells still being there, and wanting to be filled back up? therefor sending hunger hormones out of wack?\n\nDoes this mean that getting rid of these empty fat cells would decrease hunger, giving you a similar appetite to someone who's always been a normal weight, rather than formerly overweight/obese?\n\nThe only ways I've found you can get rid of fat cells are liposuction and cool sculpting- would either of these procedures have this kind of affect on regulating hunger hormones?"}, {'Recovery': 'The importance of a calibrated scale  I keep my scale in a room downstairs but then put it away when I’m done with it. \n\nYou can see where this is going, can’t you? \n\nI moved it to another location downstairs when I rearranged a few things.

But I wanted to share something I’ve discovered and that is working on yourself, your mental health, and other aspects of your physical health before trying to lose weight if possible. \n\nI lost a lot of weight a few years ago. I was in a bad place mentally and bandaging it. Using weight loss to cope. When the mental illness got bad to a point where I couldn’t hide, I gained everything back. I gained even more back. I used food to help myself feel better temporarily. I used food as a reward for doing simple tasks that my mental illness made really difficult. \n\nNow, I’ve been doing this for a few weeks, and I plan to continue doing it. But I also did a few different things before I started. I got a therapist. (I had one already, but I started being honest with a new one). I started a skincare routine. I started journaling. I started reading more. I started doing affirmations. I started spending time with my family more often.  I put myself on a schedule — I sought out connections, got my first job (I’m 19), I’m joining clubs at college. \n\nThe weight loss now is not driven by my self hatred, or my need to distract myself from my feelings. Now, I am in such a better place mentally that it comes from a place of compassion for myself and my health. You can’t hate yourself thin.

I started my current weight loss journey in May from a starting BMI of 41. I felt horrendous both physically and mentally at that weight and my BMI had been 40+ for a long time. After losing 15 kg / 33 lbs, I am now down to a BMI of 36 and I\'m steadily losing about 1 kg/ 2.2 lbs per week. I achieved this with a sensible plant-based intermittent fasting regime (nothing too harsh though - I just skip breakfast) and moderate amounts of exercise that I enjoy. It is hard to overstate the impact the lifestyle change had on my health and my social life - I have only lost about one third of the excess weight that I carry and I still have a long way to go but I already feel like a different person. Also, I haven\'t experienced any negative health effects that people typically experience, like losing hair and I think that\'s because I\'ve been doing it healthily. So far, so good.\n\nHere is the thing though - I am currently out of work and I honestly believe that if I had a job, I wouldn\'t be able to do this. Not having time to take care of healthy meals and exercising isn\'t even my biggest worry. I fear that the stress would cause me to overeat and that I would be exposed to a lot of unhealthy food in a conventional office. I also think I wouldn\'t be able to stick to intermittent fasting, or even to keeping my portions small. When I\'m working, I always have this perception that my brain is running low on energy and I end up eating too much.\n\nThese days I spend most of my day reading about weight loss, browsing this subreddit, watching YouTubers talk about weight loss and tracking my weight, and otherwise just browsing the internet and reading books that I\'ve been meaning to. So nothing too stressful. Some jobs have come up, including ones I was genuinely excited about, and I had some interviews, but when I got rejected, I consoled myself that at least I\'ll be able to continue my weight loss journey undisturbed.\n\nObviously this cannot go on forever and eventually I\'ll have to get a job, even though money isn\'t an issue for now. But I am already terrified that when that happens, all my hard work will be undone.\n\nI am at the point where I have been meaning to take some language classes for months but I have been procrastinating about signing up because I\'m terrified that even that could turn out to be too much stress and distract me from my goal.\n\nPlease someone tell me that I\'m irrational and I don\'t need to put my life on hold in order to lose weight?\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the replies so far! Like I said in my post, I\'m not primarily worried that I won\'t have "time" for my weight loss efforts. I am more worried about stress eating, which I\'m very prone to, and being in environments with too much junk food available. I have a friend with cancer who really should lose weight according to her doctor. But she has a stressful office job where people shout at her all the time and she constantly keeps taking breaks to go to the vending machine to get yet another chocolate.

I could not do strenuous exercise, I wanted to eat like shit every day, but instead of using it as an excuse, I used this as motivation and a reality check of how quickly one’s health can plummet. \n\nI understand depression, stress, PCOS, and other autoimmune issues may make it more difficult to lose weight, but it isn’t as hard as people make it seem. It takes discipline, and eating less. \n\n2) I figured out my BMR and decided to go on a hefty calorie deficit. I decided to eat 1600-1800 calories a day consisting of lean meat, citrus fruits, berries, a lot of greens, chia/flax seeds, oats, non fat yogurt, fat free dairy sources, and below 100g of carbs a day (whole grains). Essentially my diet was high protein, low carb, with added fruits for fiber. Also, absolutely no added sugar in anything. The only sugar I consumed was natural and in minuscule amounts. \n\nGET A FOOD SCALE, A TRACKING APP FOR CALORIE COUNTING, AND ACCOUNT FOR EVERYTHING! that little scoop of peanut butter… calories   your coffee creamer and caramel drizzle…. calories    the oil you use to cook your food…. calories\n\nTIP: search up low calorie high volume foods. for those that binge eat, this is a cheat code.\n\nTik Tok was my best friend, I found plenty of low calorie, tasty options that can be made in as little as 10 minutes. just search low calorie meals or something related and there will be thousands of videos. \n\n3.) As I previously mentioned, I just got out of the hospital for neurological issues and I was grieving so I didn’t have the energy to do strenuous exercise (plus Covid made me scared to go the gym) so I walked every day after I ate dinner for 45 minutes (about 3 miles). \n\n4.) I allowed myself one day a week to eat what I wanted within reason. If I wanted pizza on Friday, I would have 2 or 3 slices instead of a whole pizza. This teaches you discipline and also creates a better relationship with food allowing you to succeed in losing weight.\n\n5.) I weighed myself every 2 days in the morning before I ate. This let me keep track of my progress. \n\n6.) most importantly, I didn’t let setbacks turn into failures. If I messed up one day, I would make it up the next. I didn’t set out to lose weight for vanity reasons, I did it to improve my quality of life and to prove myself wrong. From a child I had depression, OCD, and ADHD. I would often binge eat and it would physically pain me to see food left on the plate. Even if I was full and food was still in my vicinity, it would be eaten. \n\nAt my biggest I was nearing 360 pounds. As of today I weigh 197 pounds and have a much better relationship with food. I don’t follow strict rules anymore, I just eat intuitively because I know the calories and macros in most foods I eat.

It is going to to take sacrifice and a lot of willpower, but the benefits you will receive from not only losing weight, but proving yourself wrong will outweigh any possible short term satiation you get from giving into cravings or eating habits.\n\nSecond Edit: This is the method that worked best for me. If you have underlying conditions, it would be best to speak to your physician. I apologize for my phrasing regarding PCOS, as I am a male and cannot experience what it’s like to live with it. My goal wasn’t to minimize any of these conditions, but to reinforce the notion that you are capable of reaching your goals despite physical ailments.'}, {'Neutral': 'Losing weight  I’m coming up to 275lbs now and I’m 15.

Today, I post my after pictures and can\'t believe it!  8 years ago, I was morbidly obese. At 5\'2" and over 200 pounds, I was depressed, insecure, sedentary in every way, and exhausted. I made this post here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/20df6h/i_just_took_my_before_pictures_and_feel_awful\n\n\nIt has been a long journey. One that included three pregnancies, lots of therapy, "diets." I joined gyms and stopped going. After taking the "before" photos, I lost ~30lbs using CICO (1200 calories/day) and maintained that until my second pregnancy. At the end of my second pregnancy, I wasn\'t as heavy as the beginning of my first and that made me happy. I got back down to pre-baby#2 weight after the birth. Between my second and third pregnancies, I regained 15lbs. \n\nAfter my third baby, I found a new motivation to crush that weight I had been maintaining (150-160lb) and keep going.\n\n\nI slowly worked my way to a healthy relationship with food. One that continues to evolve.\n\nAfter maintaining my weight of 120lbs for a year, I needed hernias repaired, diastasis recti repaired, and felt it was the right time to explore skin removal. I had that combined surgery three weeks ago. It\'s been a rough recovery, but I\'ve been filled with nothing but gratitude for where I was, where I\'ve been, and where I\'m going.\n\nI still have work to do. I hate the gym, I hate going and I hate scheduling time to go and I don\'t like being there. I\'m not sure why, although I think it may have something to do with hating gym class in school and the locker rooms and it feeling too similar. I\'m more active now than I\'ve ever been, but at this step of my journey I think it\'s time to explore how I can be the strongest, healthiest person possible for myself and my family with intentional fitness training. \n \nI wish I could go back and tell the lady in those Before photos that it\'s going to be ok, and that in 8 years, she wouldn\'t change a thing. I can\'t, so I wanted to share this for those that may be feeling the way I did back then. Everyone was so kind in that post. And any time I posted here in between then and now.

I gained about 10lbs of muscle and lost inches when I got into heavy strength training (Westside Barbell training if you\'re familiar with it). I moved into CrossFit and weightlifting meets for a while and sat at around 175. Then COVID hit. I moved from NC to CA, and I stopped working out. I somehow only managed to gain about 10lbs during those 2 years, but I\'ve obviously lost my body composition. \n\nI decided to get serious about dropping some pounds in June/July. I know my body likes Whole30 and lower carbs best so I thought why not try Keto? I dropped 7lbs pretty quick (water weight) in mid-July, then got a new job and moved back across the country the last week of July/first week of August so there was about 3 weeks of fast food and quick meals, no real tracking, and 0 workouts.  \n\nI\'ve been sitting at around 187lbs for a few weeks now. I gave myself time to get adjusted to moving, etc., then lowered my carbs again, got down to 183lbs. I joined a CrossFit gym last week and am going through their intro assessments. I worked out M-W-F with them and was SO SORE. It felt so good to get back into it even though walking was a task. I tracked very loosely a couple of days, then had a few work events and it went (slightly) sideways. \n\nImagine my "surprise" when in 5 days time, the scale went from 183lbs to 190lbs. \n\n**This is where I need you to hit me with science** (I do well with knowing the WHY). Logic tells me a 7lb weight gain in a matter of days is a combination of getting back into heavy workouts and not the best eating. I\'m also dealing with bloating and constipation which I\'m chalking up to my attempt at low carb/keto. My fiber was way too low and I was eating too much cheese. I\'ve had to take laxatives a few times lately to get things moving after 3-4 days of nothing. \n\nI bought a new food scale this weekend and was deliberate in my meal prep. Today will be day two of accurate tracking. I weighed yesterday and was still at 190lbs. I\'m going to stay off the scale a few days and focus on tracking, workouts, and my water intake (a gallon most days). \n\nSo - science away, friends! Tell me this is my body adjusting after a stressful end of July/early August (moving across the country, new job) and now a new workout program.

I know this sub is about losing weight, but I feel like the actual end goal gets lost here a lot.  The end goal isn\'t a  number on the scale.  The end goal is actually maintenance.  I\'ve been maintaining a 55 pound weight loss since the beginning of the year and thought some of you may appreciate a few things I\'ve learned along the way...\n\n* Maintenance isn\'t as exciting as losing weight.  I personally step on the scale every morning (to each there own). I used to get so excited seeing that "whoosh" of pounds off once in a while. That "whoosh" doesn\'t happen anymore.  I know that I\'m in the correct place if my weight is within a 5 pound limit. If it creeps up, I correct the issues and it creeps back down. It\'s just life as I know it. \n* Many people think, "I\'ve hit my goal weight. YAY! Now I can go back to doing the same thing I was doing before I started dieting. What a relief!" The fact is, the way you were eating previously is what put weight on your body to begin with. Whatever changes you make, you have to be willing to make them forever. There isn\'t an end. There isn\'t a place where you simply stop caring and do whatever you want.\n* You have to still set goals to give you something to be excited about, but it isn\'t scale numbers anymore. I  set up a reward system this year for the number of purposeful exercise miles I complete this year. For me, I wanted to get 1,250 miles this year.  Every time I go over 250 miles, I get a reward, and the rewards got bigger with higher miles. For example, 250 miles=bike on the beach, 750=see a comedian\'s performance, 1250=nice trip.\n* Speaking of rewards, don\'t let your rewards be food...ever.  Food can be great.  Food can be wonderful.  Food should not be a reward for good behavior or reaching a goal.  There are so many other things you can use as rewards. It\'s a bit harder to figure them out because most of us are programmed to reach for food to "treat" ourselves when something goes right. Don\'t do it. Figure out the other things in life that excite you and reward yourself that way. \n* I\'m a foodie.  I really do like good food.  Because of this, I only eat food that I really like.  If it doesn\'t taste good, I feel no need to continue eating it. I don\'t need excess calories of food that\'s just so so. \n* Your attitude towards yourself isn\'t going to magically change because you lose weight. I was okay with myself when I was heavier, and I\'m okay with myself at a smaller weight. I went through my weight loss journey because I knew that I could treat my body better than I had been. I wanted to improve my chances of living longer. I wanted to live a healthier lifestyle. \n\nSo, that\'s it.  I\'m not an expert.  I\'m just a regular person who\'s used CICO for a year and a half and have been successful. So many people have shared experiences that inspired me.

With university going online I became very sedentary, and with my cooking job at a local pub I started eating their food frequently which was primarily deep fried things.

On August 17th I finally felt some motivation to begin and while starting slow, I wanted to build on that. My starting point was at 285 lbs at 5’9, so I first started with the calorie counting. I’ve never been super disciplined but I stuck with it and cleaned up my diet. Generally I fast through breakfast, eat some fruit and a chicken wrap or something along those lines for lunch and have some some soup or a salad with some kind of beef or chicken for dinner with plenty of water throughout the day to suppress my appetite. I’ve also been doing some basic weight lifting and excersises like jumping jacks and sit-ups, and going on a daily 20-30 minute walk each morning. It’s still early of course but I’ve stuck with everything very strictly and in around 20 days I’ve lost 9 lbs!\n\nI’m definitely new to all this so I’m not the best person to offer advice but the biggest thing has certainly been discipline and the mentality that every small step matters. If I have 10 minutes to kill, I’ll do a minute of jumping jacks to knock out 16 calories. If I’m making a chicken wrap at my work, I’ll cut out the cheese and save 100 calories, and I think all those little decisions have made a big difference so far.'}, {'Recovery': 'Currently grieving my very large son  -he\'s not actually dead, but it feels like it. \n\n-My son [23 Y/O M] is over 700 pounds (744 pounds/ 5\'6" tall) My wife and I have cried, begged and pleaded so many times already to get him help but nothing seems to stick...he just doesnt care to help himself\n\n-My wife and take a fuck-load of responsibility.

Thursday, I (24f), finally hit my goal weight of 120lb. I started at 270lb which has made my total weight loss 150lb in 3 years. I\'m just so excited that this journey is finally over and I\'d like to share it with all of you! \n\nWhen I started the journey I wasn\'t sure what to expect. I knew I had to face my biggest obstacle- myself. I didn\'t want to be the "big" girl at the gym. I didn\'t want to be the person in the family who was "dieting". I wanted to avoid all conversations and attention that could be brought on me. \n\nI\'d be lying if I said I wasn\'t my biggest obstacle the entire time. To constantly motivate myself, I only had one long-term goal (my final weight) and stuck with all short-term goals. I found myself fighting to see a 9 at the end of the number on the scale (259, 249, 239 etc). I found this to be more of a game that kept me accountable and motivated to keep pushing. I rewarded myself with small treats such as a night off, a new shirt/pants, or a simple dinner that wasn\'t on my weekly plan. My favorite was my  "Bagel Saturday". I love bagels, so I always made sure I could have one on Saturday mornings. \n\nWhat did I do to lose the weight? It really comes down to calories and exercise.\n\n• Counting Calories- I stuck to 1200-1500 per day. The last 3 months I was around only 1000 per day. I made sure everything I consumed had nutritional value. I always wanted to burn between 500-1000 calories more than I would consume.\n• Cardio- I mostly did cardio as my main form of exercise. When I started, I was only able to run .5 mile and now I can run 9 miles. I usually ran 5-6x a week. I would start with a goal and if I felt I could go farther or faster, I would make a new goal throughout the run. \n• Youtube at home workouts- This was a huge help! I was always too nervous to do upper body or core workouts at the gym. Youtube has thousands of free videos that are available at your fingertips. I utilized several videos throughout my journey. \n\nI just want everyone to know that it is possible and there are people in this world going through the same journey as you! Keep yourself accountable, but don\'t beat yourself up. There are going to be intense days where your mental state just isn\'t right and THAT\'S OKAY!

I felt so frustrated and angry and just wanted to be thinner than everyone in that room. Blinded, I aimed for the lowest possible amount of calories. 800 calories a day. \n\n\nMaintained that and lost weight quite rapidly. Started with HIIT but hit a plateau and switched to walking (aiming for fat burn) for 40 minutes 5 days a week. Did 10 minutes of weights and increased to 20 minutes later combined with the walking, as well as 10 minutes of exercises for constipation because with not enough food comes not enough poo.\n\n\nWas losing around 700g a week or so, just like that.

Of course it always led to me gaining the weight back and then some. \n\nI’ve been on a steady decline since the early spring and it feels REALLY good.

He has quite a bit of trauma around his weight and was very resistant on starting to work on losing weight. He was bullied a lot, and his mom constantly brought up that he could lose some. To me he is perfect as is; all I care about is that he is happy. I was immensely proud that he overcame his hangups and asked me to help him!\n\nHis goal was to commit 20 weeks to eating healthier and in moderation. The plan was OMAD, one cheatday per week and I would count his calories (due to his hangups about it). After the 20 weeks he would weigh himself and adjust the plan if necessary. The mealplan was nothing complicated. Every meal had a salad, with either cheese or smoked tofu. The rest was like we always ate, but just weighing everything.\n\nIt was amazing how fast we saw results. After only a few weeks, he slept better and had more energy during the day. Around 6 weeks in, his clothes started fitting differently, and now his old shirts are super loose, and he fits in his old jeans! So without weighing we definitely knew it was working. And today, he finally got the courage to step on the scale. I estimate that he lost around 20 kgs! The next goal is to add another 20 weeks at this plan and then evaluate if he wants to continue or needs a maintenance break. \n\nIt was a huge step to take to commit to this and then stick to it. It wasn't easy, he struggled a lot in the beginning with cravings, but he did it! And now at the end of it, he is happier, feels more comfortable in his own skin and has more energy.

I took baby steps and used the slow method of instilling new habits into my routine. Thanks to that, I’ve been able to transition myself out of overeating habits of the past. Prior to losing weight, I don’t think I ever really had binge episodes. I just ate constantly and always made room for more, but that was my normal at the time. \n\nWhich brings us to right now. I’ve been noticing that I can’t control my eating while high even when I attempt to plan (not really a big surprise there) and most importantly, when in emotional distress. These past 4 weeks I’ve been overeating to the point of stomach pain. I know that it hurts physically to do this, not to mention mentally. I was starting a new weight loss phase, but I have been struggling mentally with getting under 165 pounds and am switching into maintenance. Whenever I hit that 165 lbs or get below it,I get scared, because I find myself having to face the realities of certain difficulties I have that losing weight will never fix. \n\nLogically, I’ve always known the losing weight wouldn’t change who I am in how I interact with others, so that has never been the driving force for my weight loss. However, even though I know that intellectually, I think I’ve finally reach the point in my journey where a secret, silent part of myself has been desperately holding on to the hope that a smaller body would magically grant me social skills and satisfaction in my life. That secret part of me sees me approaching these lower numbers, while still struggling against the same demons after all of these years. I think the realization that I’m not magically becoming different internally as my weight decreases is mentally tormenting. The secret part of myself is not so quiet anymore and it is leading me to give in to binging. \n\nWhen I mindlessly eat, it feels both pleasurable and numbing at the same time. Even as my stomach begins to hurt, the constant hand to mouth motion keeps my mind occupied, while the pleasure of tasting lulls me and calms my intense emotions and thoughts. Again, I know intellectually that this new habit won’t help in the long run, but it hurts more to confront myself and my struggles. \n\nFor now, I just eat and log everything. My order just arrived, so making my way through it should keep my mind and feelings occupied for an hour or so (as long as I can pace myself…). \n\nI hope this post made sense to someone. Has anyone else dealt with this kind of mental struggle/cognitive dissonance as you approach your goal weight? I feel like I’m mentally torn in two places, but if I’m honest, I leave the easy way out (for me!) of numbing myself with food, so I don’t see how to get out of this binge cycle.

I have 2 theories: \n\n- I’m underestimating my calories significantly. I really don’t think it’s this and I don’t want to start calorie counting as I have a history of EDs. \n\n- my eating is sporadic - sometimes 1 meal a day, sometimes 2 + snacks, sometimes a big meal out so I don’t know if the constant changing is affecting something? \n\n- I don’t eat much (any) fruit or veg. So although I’m in a calorie deficit I’m not getting the right nutrition? \n\nAny advice would be gratefully accepted!! TIA'}, {'Recovery': "Why am I not losing weight?  I, 22F (5'2/140lb) am currently overweight. I decided to start my fitness journey actually this time and have started a calorie deficit. I've went from walking 300 steps a day to \\~10k steps a day everyday. I've started sleeping earlier and even cut out unhealthy foods. I saw no change for almost a month and decided to ask my sister (24F 5'3) to begin this journey with me. She also gained a lot of weight this past year. For reference, we both have always been 125 lbs MAX. There was only one time in my life where I was 133lbs but it wasn't for long and I somehow lost the weight in a few months. Anyways, 125 has been the max and so we both wanted to lose weight. She was 145lbs starting and is now 139! I'm super happy for her as she's also wanted to lose weight. My point is, we eat the exact same foods, maybe I have the occasional snack more than she does but both of us at a calorie deficit. I probably have 100 more calories than her some days but most days it's the same. Anyways, what could be the reason? I'm younger than her too so I'm a bit confused. She also doesn't walk or work out so it's not because of exercise. I also want to say of course I am super happy for my sister, this isn't coming fro a place of jealousy because I know it works differently for every body but it's raising concern for me because does this mean theres something wrong with my body? Almost 2 months eating healthy and for some time calorie deficit yet no weight change. And it makes me more concerned since someone I started with and ate the same foods as is losing weight.

September 05, 2022  # Is today is your Day 1?\n\n\u200b**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!\n\n\u200bSo you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.\n\n# Why You’re Overweight\n\nOur bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.\n\n# Before You Start\n\nThe very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.\n\n# Tracking\n\nHere is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends (unaffiliated) apps like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit](http://loseit.com/) or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)\n\n# Creating Your Deficit\n\nHow do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.\n\n# Exercise\n\n...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.\n\nIt has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \\*awesome\\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.\n\n# Crawl, Walk, Run\n\nIt can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.\n\n# Acceptance\n\nYou will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.\n\nDo not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.\n\n# Additional resources\n\nNow you’re ready to do this.

All in 2 months of consistent daily healthy eating. I’m officially under 200lbs.

Do you guys think that is a good goal weight? When I told my doctor I was thinking about dropping down my weight loss to 160, she told me I 180 is fine because "I don\'t want to be scrawny." At the time, that made sense to me and I agreed, but lately I\'ve been pondering, what if 160 is actually where I need to be and the only reason why she told me not to go that low is because that\'s simply what she prefers?   \n\n\nShe\'s a doctor, so of course I feel the need to listen to her advice, but I\'m still worried that 180 just isn\'t the right weight for me.'}, {'Recovery': 'Help me understand my habits  Sorry if this isn’t allowed.

I gave up cakes and all processed foods ate clean on a low calorie not dropping below 1200 a day and keeping my proteins between 80-100 grams.

To my assurance she said that since it\'s just 0.1 over that she didn\'t want to give me medicine and rather she wants me to check my sugar daily, exercise and diet, if done right I could reverse it. That\'s all I needed to hear, I went home to my parents house(I was staying there because my doctor is in that town) and me and my mom got to studying diabetes and diet. We have 2 weeks for my next follow up.\n\nTo my luck that same day of the visit, I also had developed a horrible ear infection, which throughout the week carried over to my other ear. So with that horrible pain, I wasn\'t able to exercise the first week, but my mom was able to cook me healthy portioned meals. The second week came and the ear infection is gone so my mom was ready to get me exercising. Shoutout to my mom cause she dragged me to the park near home and had me walk for 45min, not only that but she did the walk with me so I didn\'t feel alone in this journey.  At 330lbs, this was another eye opener because walking became such a challenge. But I muscled thru it and the 2 weeks were up. Walked into the doctor visit, 15lbs down and a happy doctor. She now said we have to come back in 2 months for new bloodwork and see how I\'m doing.\n\nAfter that I felt comfortable leaving my parents house( I have four other siblings at my parents house and prefer my parents pay their attention to them) and to my own to continue the journey on my own.\n\nHere is my daily routine and I am by no means an expert but this is what has been working for me,\n\nI eat three meals a day, however I only eat whole/organic foods with none to very little sugar. This is thanks to discovering "flavcity with bobby" on youtube that now me and my mom love watching. I also don\'t eat past 5pm.  And for exercise, I literally just walk 2x a day for 30 mins. First walk is first thing in the morning and the second one is after my small dinner in order to lower my sugar. I can\'t believe it took me 23 years to discover just how powerful and beneficial walking is. I now love walking. And I\'ve been able to continue this lifestyle because it is one that I can see myself maintaining forever rather then a crazy diet that I would break after 2 weeks and intense cardio. \n\nAnd finally here are my results at the start of week 7:\n\nStart weight 330lbs\n\nWeek 1 & 2: Lost 15lbs (315)\n\nWeek 3: Lost 5lbs (310)\n\nWeek 4: Lost 5lbs (305)\n\nWeek 5: Lost 5lbs (300)\n\nWeek 6: Lost 9lbs! (291) (I\'m not sure why I lost more this week but my guess is the only change I made was instead of walking inside on a treadmill, I walk outside in the sun both times this week)'}, {'Recovery': "Going to a BBQ today and I pretty much know it's going to blow my calorie goal  So, I have been logging my calories and exercise for the past couple of days, and have been doing fairly well.

I talked to my mom about what they are serving and its hamburgers, scalloped potatoes, corn casserole, and cherry turnovers for dessert.

We don't do it often so I don't feel like it's a big part of my lifestyle or anything, but I don't want to miss the occasions when we do have plans. I also don't really want to like take a salad for myself when everyone else is having burgers. I could, but I straight up don't want to.\n\n\nSo,  what would you do?\n\n\nAs I see it, my options are:\n\n\n1) Have one cheat day.

Hello all\n\nSW:105KG CW:100KG GW:80KG, 183cm, M\n\nFirst time poster here, I have been consistently making progress through dieting and regular excercising (30 mins cardio daily + 1 hour of strength every 2 days), for dieting I cut back oil, salt, and carbs, I usually just eat vegs in salad (no dressing), and boil/roast/steam whatever proteins (majorly chicken breast) I want to eat, occasionally paired with one potato. I eat everything pretty much unseasoned. Top it up with 1-2 protein shakes. 1\\~3 cheat meals per week.\n\nIt worked out pretty good for me as I losed around 5KGs in August and still maintained some muscle without losing too much (around 1KG within those 5KGs of lose).\n\nOne thing worries me is that I'm probably losing it way too fast, could this be a bad thing as I keep going? I don't think the current diet and lifestyle is unhealthy at all, I rarely feel hungry, but the words around about all the down side of losing it too fast concerns me quite a bit."}, {'Neutral': "Feeling lost and frustrated  So, I never posted on here before but I read a lot of the posts and everyone seems really supportive and I learned a lot from this group so far. I just kind of want to reach out because I'm feeling really frustrated and hopeless right now. \n\nI've made many attempts to lose weight before, and I'm pretty aware of how the science of weight loss/gain works (calories, macros, how to calculate all of the stuff we need to know, etc.) and I've always tried my best to attempt weight loss in a healthy, sustainable way. However, I've always slipped through the cracks with every attempt. I try to go in with different mindsets each time and I always find a way to let myself down. And that just makes it all the more difficult to start again. I've heard many times before that it's okay to mess up (and it definitely is), just move past it and continue on with your journey. I don't know why I struggle with this so hard. It's like, I feel this infinite amount of disappointment after I get off track and it's like I can't get over it. And I usually end up binging because I stress myself out over that tiny mistake. The solution is obvious, but I still can't seem to fight myself off from continuing with the self sabotage. \n\nI also am coming to terms with the fact that weed has been playing a huge role in me falling off track. I live in Canada so it's very accessible to me. I think I've also been getting high often because I just can't come to terms with who I am these days. There's a really strong self hatred for letting myself get so unhealthy, and I think the weed distracts from that. But I'm having a really hard time letting go of it because it gives me some temporary relief from myself and my shitty attitude towards myself, as well as the daily struggles in life (I'm a college student and working part-time). \n\nThere's a lot of other stuff that's making it difficult, but I'll save that for another post in the future. Right now, I feel I really need some advice on having a healthier mindset, and how to stay confident in yourself and your journey. I know the way I'm thinking isn't okay. If I could afford a therapist right now, I absolutely would see one. But that's just not the reality for me right now. So I'm just trying my best by myself. \n\nAnyways, if you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read about my struggles!

"you can\'t out-train a bad diet" \n\ntruer words never uttered- and i\'m living proof. \n\nstarted my journey last august, 480lbs, got down to 350lbs by spring... could\'ve even gotten lower, maybe 320 or 330, had i remained stronger and more focused. but 130lbs was a hell of a feat in less than one year. i know people have done more, but i was thrilled by this. \n\nand therein lay part of my problem. maybe. i became content with this minor success, more than halfway to my goal, and am now wondering if that was part of the reason i began to not only stagnate, but go backwards. every 10lbs i lost, i told myself "that\'s a number i\'ll NEVER see again"... once i passed it on the way down, that was it forever- or at least that\'s what it was supposed to be. \n\nbut this summer something happened to me. first of all, the past 2-3 months have just gone by in the blink of an eye- seriously now, where did this summer disappear? secondly, i seemed to have more social events than ever, but that\'s no excuse, because when i started i was always invited to things and was just that guy that didn\'t eat when going out. i found what worked for me; an IF of 18:6-20:4, somedays OMAD (unintentionally), plus tons of exercise- and that shit was just flying off. i still train every single day (had to take 10 days off recently though- my first and only such break since starting), 2-3 hours, and very intensely... but my diet has been god-awful. loads of fast food again, eating all hours, not restricting calories, not watching it... and so, here i am, back to a spot i said i\'d never be again- almost at that dreaded 400 pound mark again. yikes. and it all came back on so quickly- 40lbs in just under two months, despite intense daily training. crazy, eh? my biggest worry going into this was that i\'d balloon back, but thought i\'d never allow it after how hard i\'d worked and how far i\'d come... yet here i am again, somehow. i fumbled the ball pretty hard. i know what all i\'ve gotta\' do to get to where i need to get... i was on the right path; an upward-trajectory... but now it seems harder than before to get back into it- that super-focused mindset, that is. because the exercise is there. but i admittedly could up the working out intensity even more, as it was in those first few months. i feel like momentum is an often overlooked thing when talking about falling off any kind of wagon- and that can go either way; the momentum of weeks/months of clean eating and hard training or the inverse; what was meant to be a cheat meal turned into a cheat day turned into a cheat weekend into a week into a month, etc. but yeah, i need momentum- that is most important for me on my journey i\'ve found. once i am going, no matter how hard, no matter how uncomfortable and painful, i have all those hours/days/weeks/months behind me- i would feel awful to cheat/deviate/fail. but i did. i somehow fell off and the momentum of cheating has me caught up in it. but tomorrow things change for good. i never wanna\' be the "yoyo" guy. i never (again) wanna\' see the numbers i\'m gonna\' see on the way down (again). never again. worked too damn hard- succumbing to the temptation is all i\'ve done my entire life. i was so ready for a big change that i was willing to endure all the pain, soreness, blood, sweat, tears, and i\'m ready again. just a minor setback. \n\ni started writing this a couple of days ago and just finished now, so maybe some things won\'t align, but ultimately i\'m posting just to have this as a journal entry; a remind to myself of how big a fuck-up i feel like for letting it get so out of control (again). there were moments in recent weeks/months where that big black hole of hunger came over me- just like when i was at my very worse, on the way too 500lbs. that hunger is unlike anything else and makes me do absolutely anything to fill that void. can be 3am... i will get dressed, drive to the nearest fast food spot and order enough for four people, easily. but no more after tonight- i am back to the way i was when i started last year. i up-kept the clean life for many months before deviating and will do it again. it\'s super hard, but the prize will be so worth it. the life i\'ve always wanted is at the end of my journey.'}, {'Neutral': "What do you think my activity level is?

It makes it worse because I took pictures of my whole body and comparing them to pictures I’ve taken in the past…I definitely notice some weight gain. It is very slight and unnoticeable to others but it doesn’t make me feel great. It makes me discouraged and think what’s the point? So I think that also leads me to binge. I know comparing how I looked in the past vs now isn’t helpful but I can’t help taking the pictures even though I know it’s not productive. Sometimes I think I look good in some of them and other days not so much. I feel in the deep end and I don’t know how to get out if this cycle. I try to meal plan but then I just say “screw it” and binge. How do I get out of this cycle? Would it help to weigh myself every 2 weeks to keep myself accountable or will I end up fixated on my weight? I honestly don’t know what to do. \n\nI’m not overweight but I still am not the weight I want to be. I’m 5’2 and when I weighed myself at the end of July I was 121 lbs.

Ever since my last few years in school where I no longer had to do any PE or fitness I have steadily just gained more and more weight. I used to run the 1500 meters for my class and year on Sports Days and I was both good at it and enjoyed it. I used to spend all two hours of fitness in the school gym pushing myself rather than chatting like most other people. Now I get out of breath and entirely worn out walking up a hill. Comments about it never bothered me, being called fat, being told how it's effecting my health never bothered me. But then recently due to other things going on in my life and because I was just so tired of having to look for larger sizes of clothing that just never matched what style I liked I've finally begun to lose weight. My process that has actually worked extremely well for me was just splitting my eating into three meals, breakfast lunch and dinner, every day. I try to never skip them or forget and have them around the same times each day. Through this I have managed to massively cut down on my snacking and cravings. I also started just following the recommended portion sizes for foods for each of my meals and if I absolutely feel the need to snack I make sure it's fruit which I usually chop up into many pieces to draw it out and help avoid any binge cravings. In the rare cases I snack on crisps for a treat for myself I separate out large bags into weighed portions to resist the subconscious temptation to just keep eating from the bag.  \n\n\nI also have been pushing myself to do 30-40 minutes on an exercise bike every day at a pace that gets me out of breath and sweating hard. There have been times when I just didn't do it, times when I was just 'too busy' in my head and that was the same for my meals too. But I didn't dwell on those, I kept just plodding on, taking each day at a time as it's own enclosed thing regardless of any 'failures' on previous days.  \n\n\nNow, after a month and three weeks I have managed to go from 252lbs down to 232lbs approximately. I make it a habit not to weigh myself too often and instead feel my progress more through my shrinking waist size and how much better and less bloated I feel. I really think the problem I and others have struggled with is diets that make huge, drastic lifestyle changes and don't educate people enough on good habit forming. Splitting things into three meals of small-moderate portion sizes has helped me avoid binge cravings massively. I also think people worry too much about 'falling off the wagon' then use that as an excuse to give up when really having the odd unhealthy meal isn't going to massively upset and derail your weight loss unless you allow it to become a habit without control.  \n\n\nDon't beat yourself up, don't succumb to negativity and I think anyone can achieve their goals, find a weight loss style that suits you and avoid the diet seesaw by forming healthy habits as part of your weight loss.

I’m (27f) at the end of my rope here. I have been steadily gaining weight for the past three years and am now at the heaviest I’ve been in 8 years.\n \nIn high school/freshman year of college I weighed around 185 lbs, the heaviest I’d ever been. Somehow over the course of a year I lost 50 lbs. I had been dieting for a while but nothing ever worked until one day I ran into a friend and she told me how skinny I had gotten since the last time she saw me (~4 months prior). I hadn’t even noticed! She was my roommate in college, and I would walk to and from school every day, a 30 minute walk in sweltering South Florida heat. So what are the odds that I lose all this weight when I’m on summer break and not walking every day? Anyway, it was a welcome change and I maintained the weight for about 2 years. Then I met my now-husband and you know the story. I gained weight and my heaviest was 157 until I finally decided I’d had enough and went keto. The lowest I dropped down to was 138. Of course covid happened and my weight shot right back up, but it’s been alarming seeing this change…\n\nI gained about 15 lbs over the course of 2 years, \nagainst all odds because I tried to maintain the weight, always tried to lose weight or at least maintain, but I just couldn’t do it anymore. Finally I’d been around 158 lbs. Then my birthday passed and I gained a whopping 10 lbs!!! I know I celebrated and ate but no way it was near enough to gain 10 lbs in a month! I’ve been having a hard time coping. Idk what to do. I’m officially overweight and I can’t get control of my weight! \n\nNow I know what you’re thinking, CICO, deficit, etc etc etc. while I might not eat healthy all the time, I definitely don’t eat enough to be gaining weight so quickly in such a short amount of time. The worst part? Over the past year I have been on adderall AND Wellbutrin and am now on 40 mg Vyvanse and am still somehow not able to lose weight? I’m seriously concerned at this point.\n\nSo my question: can anyone give any insight on what it could be? I take 5 mg of lexapro, but that seems like so little to make me gain so much weight… \n\nI also switched from the pill to the copper IUD. Also, I suspect I may have PCOS. I have hormonal acne and facial hair and take spironolactone for it. I know this can lead to insulin resistance, I tried to talk to my primary about Metformin but she refused because of the off chance that my blood sugar may go too low. I’ve started taking berberine and it’s helped with my sugar spikes, but again, I can’t seem to shake this weight! I’ve also started lifting a little bit.

Hello. My relationship has always been complicated concerning food throughout my life. My parents severely restricted my food intake up to the age of 10 ( focused on outdoor activities/hunting etc) even though we enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle ( born in Scandinavia and lived in different countries). Lost both my parents in a car crash when I was 10, and then me and my sisters were permanently split up and placed with different foster families ( never had any contact with my sisters since then).\nMy first foster parents were ultra religious and I endured severe physical, emotional, sexual abuse and food was used as a form of punishment. I started hoarding /stealing food and if I got caught I was either force fed till I vomited or endured fasting/deprived for days.\nThey gave me to another couple who lived ‘off the grid’ with dozens of other couples/families in a large rural community. Food wax used as a reward and frequently as a punishment. I was encouraged to start drinking alcohol at 10 and given weed as well. For two years this couple took me and two other teen girls on a long road trip and forced us to service hundreds of different clients. Some days I had 8-10 and if any one complained I wasn’t fed. I was always hungry and drank alcohol/smoked weed to numb the hunger. Quite often I ended up stealing food for extra nourishment. Witnessed beatings, stabbings, slashing, shootings and was abused raped by every kind of person you can imagine ( including cops/judges/pastors/social workers etc). I escaped at 14 and I ended up being placed with a very well off childless couple who lived in N.California. They gave me everything I needed except love/affection. I was binge eating, drinking alcohol every day, smoking weed and two of my high school teachers ( females 29/42) seduced me and I used to raid their fridges between sex sessions and I got to eat my first hamburger and pizza at 15! I also didn’t popcorn till I went to the cinema and watched my first film at 15!!! \n\nAfter this I’ve spent the rest of my life till now yo yoing between piling on the pounds, intensive sport and losing weight.\n\nSo far I’ve practiced many different sports such as karate, boxing, self defense, karting, hiking, rugby and swimming. \n\nOver the last 18 months I’ve been working out at my local gym 5/6x a week, 2h each time,lifting weights, do cross fit bike, rowing machine, and also 1/2x a week cycling in the local countryside (30-40km each time). So 12-15h of sport a week. \n\nI don’t drink alcohol, smoke or take drugs. Don’t drink any sodas, fruit juices, don’t eat any fast food and I deliberately avoid biscuits/cakes etc.\nI get triggered each time I pass a restaurant or see people enjoying food because food triggers memories of what I suffered as a kid. I view food as either a reward or punishment ( I deliberately restrict my food intake when I feel depressed or I binge and stuff myself). \n\nI have a terrible sweet tooth, don’t like salty things ( so no charcuterie/ham/salami etc and crisps). Love peanut butter, all fruits, eat wholewheat rice/pasta/spaghetti, oatmeal every morning, love honey, agave syrup, cinnamon, apple pie, vanilla ice cream, Chinese and Indian food, dark chocolate, nuts/almonds ( eat most days), lentils, sweet potato, chicken/turkey/veal ( I don’t eat red meat), munching carrot sticks, and cheesecake/apple pie or crumble/ pecan pie ( my reward desserts). \n\nI gave up alcohol last year after decades of heavy alcohol consumption ( several detox stays before I stopped last year). Multiple long term addictions which I’m fighting with the help of my trauma informed therapist. \nI eat the same things most days but I’m scared of changing my diet because I have a very obsessive compulsive nature .

Turned out to be anxiety attacks, but it made me realize that I was not taking care of myself. I discovered LoseIt, within a year, I was down from 230 lbs. to about 200. \n\nBut then I kept going.\n\nAt my lowest weight, I was 175. That weight on a 6\'2" guy looks rough. But I was in denial. I kept telling myself that if I *just* got a little lower, I\'d stop.\n\nI did finally start loosening up my eating and exercise lifestyle, which apparently was starting to worry people around me (my wife said people kept asking if I was sick). But then a *lot* of the weight came back.\n\nSince then, I\'ve yo-yoed quite a bit.

I wanted to try just making small changes consistently and letting the results pile up instead of crash dieting and going all in on 0 carbs or counting exact calories, or going vegan or whatever.

You don\'t have to count calories (although yes, that scientifically is how weight loss works).  You don\'t have to make these huge lifestyle changes all at once.  It\'s all about small consistent changes over time, and being honest with yourself about what you can do, where you are at, and what is important to you.

Any help or advice would be much appreciated, thank you!"}, {'Neutral': 'Increased activity is a valid path to losing weight.  I\'ve been on a fitness journey since September of last year, so almost a year ago, and I\'ve posted about it off and on.  Actually since I got sober 8 years ago (I had a big problem with substances!) I started learning the importance of getting active and using my body.  That\'s been a great success for me, but I had a pretty big setback in May of last year when I got a horrible flare-up of plantar fasciitis.  I couldn\'t run and I could barely even walk more than the minimum.\n\nMy diet was already pretty good (also learned this post-sobriety)... a healthy pescetarian diet with limited junk.  Perhaps the biggest sin is too much carbs / bread / pasta, but I don\'t think anyone would say my diet is unhealthy.  Anyway, despite a healthy diet, once I became unable to run last year, I immediately started ballooning up in weight.  I tried to cut down on my portion sizes but I have to be honest, I love my food.  And I kind of have mapped out how much I eat and what not, and when that changes I feel really out of whack.  Maybe that\'s my OCD or something.  So my portion sizes didn\'t change all that much but my activity level did, and getting chubby was the result.\n\nOnce I noticed I was chubby (some "friends" started pointing it out, lol), I decided I had to get active again.  I started cycling, running (very little at first), and got back into the gym.  I believe there were some benefits but when I realized I was still overweight in May of this year, I decided to kick it into high-gear.  I got back into running twice a week and also got in the pool twice a week, too.  Nothing torturous though.  I like running.  I like swimming.  But a 1 hour run is better than 1 hour bike ride, IMO, not to mention some of the 30 minute bike rides I was doing before.  So the last few months have been a marked increase in my activity levels.\n\nThe difference has been very noticeable.  I don\'t have six-pack abs nor am I razor thin (that\'s never been me), but I\'m clearly more in shape and slimmer than I was.\n\nIn fairness, when I posted about this journey here, I think people\'s insistence about "you can\'t outrun the fork" and what not did cause me to rethink my diet a bit.   I didn\'t make any major changes, but now I do stop myself before reaching for that final slice of bread, or extra bowl of pasta, or ordering dessert, you know?  So I think that\'s been helpful.  But I don\'t think that alone has been enough to account for my weight loss, because apart from these minor tweaks my diet is basically the same as 12 months ago when I was a bit more on the chubby side.\n\nAnyway, I understand, to an extent, why people place so much emphasis on diet.  The fact is that most people\'s diet sucks, I know mine did before I learned how to eat. And if we\'re on a weight loss journey, it\'s even more likely that our diet is far from optimal.  I know there\'s obese people who think they can go pick up some weights at the gym 30 minutes twice a week and suddenly get a six pack.  It\'s unrealistic.  So I\'m on board with all of that.  However, I have to say that I wish people on these subs and in general were a little more open-minded about the fact that there\'s more way than one to lose weight.  As long as you\'re creating a deficit, you will lose weight.  For some people, that might mean a radical change in diet.  For others, it might mean starting a workout routine.  For most of us, it probably means a bit of both.\n\nAnd I think it all comes down to preferences.  Like I said, I really like my food.  And I\'m kind of OCD about what I eat, so if I have to start counting calories and asking myself "ugh did I eat enough?  Am I hungry?  I\'m not sure if I feel full", lol, well I\'ll drive myself crazy!  I prefer just to eat what I eat and then burn it off at the gym.  Plus, I like exercise.  I like the way it feels.  I like doing it.  I like the way it makes me look.  So it\'s not really a big sacrifice for me to up my activity levels.  Calorie restriction, though, I can\'t stand it!\n\nIn short, while I understand the notion that "you can\'t outrun the fork", I\'d just like to use my story to dispel the notion that increased exercise is not a valid path to weight loss.  It can be.  And I wish folks would be a little more open-minded about the fact that there\'s more than one way to slay this beast.\n\nI have posted about this before but felt like posting about it again.\n\nI was 85kg / 178cm when I started all of this and not sure exactly what I\'m at now.

I did not gain any weight. I un-learned the fear that eating my fav foods would make me gain weight. \n\nThat being said I also need to create a calorie deficit and practice portion control so I took the kind, self-compassionate ways of intuitive eating and incorporated it into my mindset.\n\nNow I\'m back in my hometown and it is very difficult if not impossible to decline food here.

I told others I\'d take the other half home( it is very common and normal in Turkey to ask them to pack your leftovers) \n\nMy mother\'s cousin told me that maybe if she slapped me in the face I\'d come to my senses.\n\n...\n\nThey all laughed and honestly I would too but I was too sensitive and felt forced to eat the rest even though I was full.\n\nI know it\'s also an eating disorder to eat alone but I definitely see myself heading in that direction.

I'm a man who has been in a weight loss battle since I was 6 years old.  20 years later I am still struggling and have learned a lot about why I struggle. The main reason is I am a food addict and if you struggle with losing weight then you might be too. \n\nNow when I say food addict I don't mean all food. Certain foods yes. But I've found I'm mainly addicted to certain ingredients. I am extremely addicted to MSG and High Fructose Corn syrup mainly. Sugar and carbs in certain foods are also sort of addictive depending on the food (sugary cereal, chips, etc). \n\nA quick google search will say sugar is addictive but nowhere does anyone say MSG is. Let me tell you If I eat enough MSG I will NOT stop eating until my stomach physically cannot hold any more food. Beyond full. Sick to my stomach full. \n\nI used to binge-eat sandwiches but then I realized I wouldn't eat them without ketchup because I actually wasn't hungry, I just wanted my fix. Guess what's in ketchup? High fructose corn syrup.\n\nI always wondered why I couldn't stop eating Fried chicken (MSG) and why sausage pizza was my favorite food (MSG + Sugar). I always wondered why I would never feel full eating breakfast sausage (MSG) and why my family joked if I wanted any more hot dog with that ketchup (was funny though). \n\nWhen I'm in a bad mood I'll turn to food to cope. But not just any food. Only the foods that I find addicting. I don't turn to green beans, corn, pork chops, beans, bananas, apples or any other natural food. I turn to pizza, breadsticks, fried chicken, burgers and fries, etc. \n\nI believe the obesity epidemic is caused by this unseen addiction we have to certain foods and ingredients. Take out the addictive foods and you will naturally lose weight. Now that is no easy task. It seems like almost everything has these addictive chemicals in them.\n\nFood companies have people working full time trying to make their food tastier at a cheaper price. Don't forget this. Don't forget that coca cola is the #1 soda in the world because they started off by putting cocaine in their drink. Coca-cola has no cocaine in it today but it is still made from coca leaves which raises questions for me personally.\n\nAgain I repeat, the answer to the addiction problem is to cut out the substance.

There will be a tl;dr at the end of this to cut right to the chase, but I do want to explain my background. \n\nHello, All! \nI’m looking to make a change.  Let me give you some background on me. \nIn 2018, I began a weight loss journey for all the wrong reasons. I was lonely, had no support system, and was tired of being obese. At my highest, I was 320 pounds. In a short span of only 6-8 months I lost over 115 pounds and hit my lowest weight of 201. During this period I was only consuming an average of 1,300 calories a day, and working out almost 2 hours per day, nearly 6 days a week. Seeing the results happen so quickly fueled my desire to keep it going. I basically had an eating disorder, though I could never convince myself back then that was what I was going through. I got into a relationship in 2019, and found my partner for life. After a few months of dating they could tell my eating habits were not sustainable and had a conversation with me about it, and helped bring it to my attention that this isn’t the way to go about a healthier lifestyle. And they were completely right. My hair was thinning horribly, my skin was losing its luster, people close to me started to notice I was beginning to look a little “sick.” I eventually had to sit down, and have an honest moment with myself. I decided I was going to start eating more, taking care of my body, and giving myself a little more patience. That all changed when COVID closed my gym, and I slowly fell down back into my old ways. From going to the gym 6+ days a week, to now not being able to go at all really put a strain on me. I lost all motivation. My lack of proper eating took me to the other end of the spectrum and I began binge eating, laying on the couch for hours a day, barely leaving the house. Years go by and now I’m at where I am today, I’m back at my heaviest weight of 322 pounds. Although I don’t binge eat, I do not eat the healthiest, but I am making a honest effort now to fix that. I’m beginning to track my calories, make sure I’m getting enough protein, vitamins, etc.  I have been very timid to go back to the gym since it has been so long, I feel like I’m back at square one. My workout plan before consisted of mostly resistance machines and a ton of cardio. I guess the main reason I’m posting this is to see if anyone has advice on how to start out at the gym as a beginner with a weight lifting routine. I’m talking deadlifts, bench presses, etc. i don’t want to rely on the assistance of the resistance machines as I believe it isn’t the best in the long run. I’m looking for something that focuses maybe 4 days with an optional 5th day as I am working full time. Hoping maybe someone out there can relate and help a brother out.

I have struggled with weight loss for the last three or four years. I always told myself that if I ever hit 250, that would be it, and I would hunker down and lose weight. Well, 250 came and went, and eventually at my heaviest I was 262 pounds. That was about 6 months ago.\n\nA lot has happened since then in my life. For one, I was brutally dumped at the beginning of March. It was wildly unexpected, and tore me to pieces. The next two months were terrible. I binged, I spent far too much on takeout and delivery, and I was miserable. My pants got tight, I hated how I looked. I stopped taking care of myself entirely.\n\nThen, something changed. I can’t pinpoint what or when, but sometime around June I just decided enough was enough. It wasn’t that I was overweight or binging but rather I was poor and didn’t need to spend money like that. I started taking my antidepressants again and for the first time ever, I felt they were truly working.\n\nSince then I’ve taken my antidepressants regularly, have been taking multivitamins since I’m well aware my diet is not quiet nutritious even still, and I’ve been taking my dog out for longer walks, for his sake rather than mine. \n\nI started liking what I saw in the mirror. I noticed my pants feeling a bit too loose— I even have to wash them twice as often as I used to so they’ll shrink a bit. I’m at the point now where I’ll need to buy a belt soon.\n\nTwo days ago, I decided I’d weigh myself before I took a shower. I felt thinner, but I couldn’t say for sure. I had a thought in the back of my mind saying “Stop it, you haven’t lost any weight. Put the scale away.” But I persisted. I stripped down and, even though I had already had a meal that day, decided it was time.\n\n236. I blinked. What? That’s a number I hadn’t seen since before the pandemic. Could I really have lost over 25 pounds? Without even truly attempting to?\n\nI checked again today. This time before a meal, and sure enough— 235. \n\nThis really inspired me. It made me feel amazing. For years I’d been trying to just reach 240, and I somehow stumbled into it. Ultimately I blame my antidepressants. They’ve helped so much. I’m not chasing the dopamine from food quite so much. Also, being poor helped.\n\nWhich sounds absurd, I know. But it’s true. I had to get clever with food. Thing is, I know myself. I know that if I buy a bunch of healthy stuff I’ll eat my favorites and leave the rest to rot. There are some foods, I’ve found, that I would rather go hungry than eat. Broccoli, I’m looking at you.\n\nSo my diet is leagues away from being extraordinary. Most days I’ll eat a totino’s party pizza for breakfast, then have another TV dinner for, well, dinner. Lunch I’ll occasionally have ramen at work. I’m satisfied, though I’m sure my sodium levels are through the roof. \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share. I don’t have anyone else to talk to about my weight loss, so this is nice.

Due to a recent incident involving a head injury and ensuing blood clot, I have been advised by my doctors to not engage in intense exercise like i was before. I can still count my steps, swim and engage in light cardio, but heavy lifting and intense cardio/HIIT are off the table for at least a month. I was really into my program and this is kind of disheartening but I am going to listen to my doctor.   \nMFP is suggesting 1550 calories/day.

The way i did this was being extremely active (doing several hours of aerobics a day, walking several miles a day, and eating either nothing or like lettuce.)

I know about the inaccuracies of fitness trackers, and hardly a day goes by when I don\'t see someone on this sub tell someone else the calorie burn on their Fitbit/Apple Watch/Garmin can overestimate by as much as 50% or more. I don\'t want to think my watch has magic powers. However.\n\nMy weight loss journey (for the 2nd or 12th time) began about 9 weeks ago. I immediately started collecting data in the adaptive TDEE spreadsheet that floats around here, as well as counting calories pretty strictly. So I now have 9 weeks of intake/weight loss data, which I think is probably enough to have the adaptive TDEE dial in to "pretty accurate"--and the math does work out, in terms of what it says my deficit is correlating to how much weight I\'ve lost. \n\nMy Garmin obviously estimates my daily calorie burn. Its app also provides me with a 7 day rolling average of daily calories burned. The past couple of weeks, I\'ve been checking it on the same day that my "spreadsheet week" ends, so it is calculating the same weekly average TDEE as the sheet is. And my watch is maybe, MAYBE 50 calories out. Last week and this week it hasn\'t even been that much. \n\nIt\'s possible that Garmin has the ratios wrong, so I burn more than it thinks I do just living my life, and less than it thinks I do while working out, but overall it is incredibly accurate. And since I don\'t eat back my exercise calories except perhaps in the few days before my cycle begins, it doesn\'t matter. This week the spreadsheet had my 7-day daily TDEE at 2585. Garmin had it at 2615. And I\'ve lost exactly the amount that I should lose if that\'s my TDEE and I eat 1700 a day.\n\nIt\'s good to assume that whatever fitness tracker you use is going to be out, maybe by a lot, especially if you eat back any of your exercise calories. But unless I\'m missing something huge, they aren\'t always wrong.'}, {'Disordered': "I am not losing weight despite my efforts and I want to cry  Hello guys,  \nI'm a woman who started her weight loss journey.

But I wanted to share my journey here both to keep myself accountable and to ask for advice and encouragement from you guys (and all of you seem very nice!). \n\nMe: 26, Male, 5\' 10"\n\nStarting weight: 209 lb (BMI 30ish)\n\nGoal: 170 lb (BMI high-normal) \n\nCurrent weight: 203 lb\n\nLoose time goal: Dec (four months time)\n\nMy whole life I\'ve been on the chubby side. Even when I ran 12 miles a week in high school, I never got as lean or fit as my other friends who did the same. And of course since high school I\'ve gained weight. In the last few years, my weight has generally stayed stable at 200 lb (which is still overweight almost obese). However in the last two years, with COVID and life situations causing me to be more sedentary, I\'ve put on weight. My peak in May was 215 lb and I genuinely felt gross. \n\nHowever something amazing happened in the last month. I was diagnosed with mild obstructive sleep apnea, which I saw as the explanation to my chronic lifelong sense of daytime sleepiness and general lack of energy. I would spend most days worrying about having energy to do things. I would need afternoon naps and still wake up feeling groggy. The doctors wanted me to get on a CPAP machine, until I tried a simple but transforming thing... changing my sleep position. I changed my sleep position from on my back to on my belly. Immediately the morning after the first night, I felt much more mental clarity and energy. Over the next few days, I found that I can do more in a day, work out harder and feel less exhausted after, and generally be more physically and mentally active. It has been a life changing transformation for me. I believe my sleep apnea is basically cured.\n\nThis was two weeks ago. With my newfound energy, I began to feel like I could work out more consistently, and decided to begin working on losing weight. It\'s funny because while I originally thought working out was the means to weight loss, I soon learned through the wonderful Internet that it really starts with CICO as is often discussed here. Yet a crazy thing also happened when I fixed my sleep apnea - I feel less hungry, I crave less specific foods, and when I do eat it takes less food to make me full. I used to gorge on meals with a big appetite even if I spent the whole day sitting at a desk. \n\nSo last week I explored several fitness apps and settled on Yazio for now, which I believe offers the most functions without a premium paid subscription. I have averaged 1300-1400 net calories a day for the last week, being sure to overestimate my intake and underestimate my exercise. I\'ve been going to the gym almost every day and finding some moderately intense workout for 30 mins (I also actually feel the need to work off this new energy I have). Still, I was amazed that in the last week I\'ve lost six whole pounds just from doing this. I haven\'t been eating particularly different (though now I\'m trying to eat more chicken breast) and just controlling my portions. With my reduced appetite, I\'m on a 16/8 intermittent fasting schedule, and yesterday in anticipation of a big dinner, I did not eat the entire day (so a 24 hour fast basically). It was nowhere near as bad as I used to feel when trying to fast - before, I would get insane hunger pangs I couldn\'t ignore. Now, I just get mildly uncomfortable. \n\nAnyway, I have a long road to go, and I definitely don\'t expect to lose six pounds a week (to clarify, these were both morning weigh-ins). I hope to stay motivated to exercise and control my food, but I know it\'s not going to be as easy as it has been in the last week.\n\nAlso an important conclusion: if you\'re struggling with daytime sleepiness, constantly feeling groggy, constantly being hungry, worrying about energy for the day... check your sleep! Lots of mild obstructive sleep apnea cases go undiagnosed, since people attribute sleepiness to "laziness" that might be "hereditary". But anyway, this isn\'t a sleep apnea subreddit or something. \n\nFor now, my plans are:\n\n1. CICO stay the course with as severe a calorie deficit as I can manage while still preserving my daily activities. I would love to stay at 1300-1400, my basal rate is supposedly 1850 or so.\n\n2. Exercise 5 times a week, mainly as a means to burn calories and maintain a heavy deficit. Not thinking about muscle right now but perhaps that\'s something I need to learn more about.\n\n3. Intermittent fasting: will be sticking to 16/8 as it is quite doable for me, I\'ve been skipping breakfast for six years. Might throw in the occasional 24 hour fast, but not sure if those are as sustainable with the severe calorie deficit. \n\n4. Food groups: trying to increase protein and decrease the other components. My family has a history of diabetes and my A1c has been high normal (though my new activity level might fix that). I already avoid snacks but I can do better with sweets (chocolate). \n\nA random question I have right now is: does walking really burn that many calories? In an average sedentary day, I walk 4000 steps, and my app tells me that\'s the equivalent of 700 calories. I guess I find that hard to believe. \n\n\nThanks for reading and welcome any words or advice!'}, {'Disordered': 'How to Structure Workouts to see progress.

My daily goal is 2840 on the app, and with my exercise and food all accounted for today I have around 1500 calories remaining to my “goal”. This is a regular thing.

I went from 160lb to 220lbs. It took me about a year to drop 60lbs. First time cutting weight and everything. \n\nThe weight loss journey is hard when you're fat, because you've essentially developed a bunch of bad habits and now you're trying to eliminate them and develop good habits. \n\nMy daily schedule during the pandemic was waking up at 1pm, playing games all day, and sleeping at 3am. Trying to fix that schedule takes time and dedication. \n\nThe weight loss journey is also filled with trial and error. I overestimated how much calories I was burning at the gym and underestimated how much I was eating. So maintaining that constant drive and motivation is difficult because if you think you're doing everything right but you see no progress, a weak willed person can easily give up.\n\nbut I stayed on the journey and slowly learned a thing or two. \n\n\\[1\\] I tried Keto for a time and learned how important calorie counting was, also learned foods high in fat will keep you full longer, so if you're ever feeling hungry, eating a tea spoon of butter is a nice trick. That lost me a couple pounds\n\n\\[2\\] Tried fasting for a time by eating one really big meal in the morning and nothing else through out the day, that helped me lose a couple more pounds. \n\n\\[3\\] working out doesn't burn that much calories, like  a mile burns about 100. So unless I was planning on running 10 miles a day, I should just skip lunch or dinner. \n\n\\[4\\] I learned what my maintenance was and how cutting 500 calories a day would result in losing 1lb a week. \n\n\\[5\\]  I never thought I would be into running but now that I'm actually good at it, I'm all in lol. I've never been a runner so I didn't think it was possible to even run without feeling pain, I just thought people powered through the pain and that was the definition endurance. It takes about 6 months of running a mile everyday until you stop feeling out of breath and muscles stop hurting. \n\nEventually I got back to my original weight but it was like an avalanche; once you see progress and what you can become you keep on pushing to eliminate bad habits and create better habits, so the sleep schedule was fixed to where I sleep at 10pm and wake up at 5am, my PS4 controller broke and that was the push I needed to stop playing video games, Facebook banned me for a while and that was the push to delete my social media entirely.\n\nNow I have new goals but it's a little more difficult to stay on track. When you're fat you can use the anger to continue to push but when you've reached a weight to where you're satisfied, the voice in your head that gives you bad advice like \\[ Be lazy, you've worked hard for the past month\\] becomes a lot more convincing. Because of this, I'm constantly changing my goals to stay motivated.\n\nOne week I'll strive for the 10 - 15% body fat goal because that's when you get abbs, the fat around your face disappears making you more symmetrical and scientifically more beautiful, and the fat around your penis disappears granting you an extra inch. The next week I don't care about abbs and I want to be so healthy that when I'm 70, I look and act like a 40 year old. \n\nEventually I'll achieve the 15% body fat goal but then comes a completely new and arguably more difficult journey, learning how to bulk.

NSV 1!\n\nWe got COVID on the trip (Vax, boostered, didn\'t matter) and I lost seven pounds in ten days. I didn\'t have covid that bad, it just seemed like an easy time to lose weight frankly. No need for pizza if I can\'t taste it.\n\nSo, I\'m finally back to work yesterday, wearing what is really not that nice of a black suit. I mean, it gets the job done but I\'m pretty sure I thrifted it years ago in grad school. Anyways, TWO PEOPLE complimented me on my suit yesterday, and I cannot recall anyone ever complimenting me on that suit. I must be wearing it better :) NSV 2\n\nEdit: Because everything is better with pictures, here is [one from September 2021 and the one in question from NYC in August of 2022.](https://imgur.com/gallery/aTL9WMG)'}, {'Neutral': "5'10 29yo male, 240LB heaviest, steadily losing but...

I gained nearly all of my weight in early 2021 and have been trying to lose ~30 pounds (F/28/5\'2"/160 lbs). I have been working out with a personal trainer since last summer (who is great and has glowing success story clients), have been counting calories, doing homecooked meals 99% of the time, portion control, saying "no" to my pushy mother-in-law, got my thyroid levels checked, eating at a deficit (1200 calories a day), drinking water, eating pickles and other 0 calorie snacks, intermittent fasting windows... I got as low as 149 at one point but then had digestive issues that, for lack of better term, backed me up. Yo-yoing a bit, I stayed at 154-157 pound as a daily weight.\n\n \nSince 2016, I have woken up every night at 3:30 AM to use the bathroom, and then it would keep me awake. Even without my phone/tv I would just stare at the wall awake until 5 AM or so, and then have to take a very unsatisfying nap before my alarm for work at 7:30 AM. I tried not drinking or eating before bed time for several hours, I tried to just \'sleep through the urge,\' I went to the doctor to see if there was any other reason (UTI?) that had me always go to the bathroom, even when I didn\'t have any water. Nothing  really conclusive other than "maybe stress."\n\n \nI started a new job in mid-August and for the first time, I am in a position that is genuinely challenging for me. After working from home/a two-month unemployment \'vacation\' I got up at 7 AM, didn\'t get home from work until 7 PM, tried my best to stay up with my husband for dinner/TV/roll20 D&D, went to bed at 11 PM and for the first time in years I did not wake up until 6AM. Fast forward to now, just three weeks later, I have been sleeping through the night every night, probably due to the new level of mental stimulation/exhaustion, and without any other changes in activity (maybe even less working out due to work schedule, I am extremely sedentary at work), diet, etc. I have managed to reach and stay between 147-149 and everyday my weight slips a little oz lower here and there. The only difference is that I am finally sleeping! \n\n \nI felt miserable for the last year - I had always been \'naturally skinny\' / ate healthy / worked out so it was so frustrating to not see the scale move despite my efforts. Even CICO... I know it\'s logical to say CICO works and if it doesn\'t then maybe it\'s me that is off with tracking, but I knew I was doing everything extremely accurately.

This time something clicked for me.\n\nLike most people on this sub know, the solution was simple, but doing it was hard…I counted every calorie I consumed for 365 days and held myself to a budget every single day.\n\nI haven’t set food inside of a gym or started counting steps, it was just all about managing my consumption.  I realized that weight is a math equation…and internalized an understanding of what balancing that equation meant.\n\nI used to say that I work out to eat, but the truth is that I simply couldn’t work out enough to match what I was eating..  So I stopped lying to myself and instead of focusing on the 10-20% of my calorie burn I could control through working out, I focused on the 100% of my consumption I could control.\n\nTo be pithy…I knew I wasn’t going to exercise my way out of a problem that I ate my way into.\n\nAnd after a year of that, I managed to get to where I am today.

I still cooked things I enjoyed, I just ate less of them! and integrated more veggies. \n* I didn't do IF, but I did start skipping breakfast and I'll never look back.  I couldn't eat 1500 calories a day and be happy with what I ate if I had to divide it across 3 meals.\n* I had to find alternatives for things I loved.  I swapped potato chips for goldfish and pretzels, gummy candy for hard candy, regular ice cream for Halo Top ice cream, etc....ignoring those cravings wasn't going to work, so I answered them with healthier choices.\n* Soups are amazing!  I don't like salad much, but I found soups could be very filling with relatively low calories.\n* I didn't get down over bad days.  I realized that my weight was not about any individual good or bad day, it was the sum of my sustained choices.\n* Some things will probably never re-renter my diet...which sucks.  I loved Burger King whoppers with cheese, but i just can't realistically fit those into my budget very well.

I started all the way back in April, so it has been five months now, and it derailed as quickly as it started. \n\nI'm 5'0''. I'm so short it's completely embarrassing. 2021 was a really awful year for me, and the stress and anxiety ended up with me gaining a lot of weight; I was at a whopping 61 kg when I decided that I needed to get my shit together and start working out a bit. I'm very forgetful sometimes and I tend to give up really easily, so I opted for a more lighter routine to get myself comfortable with the idea of working out. Eventually I got to the point that I was able to have a 3km walk about 3-4 times a week, and I was ecstatic. And I actually *did* feel a difference; I noticed that my stomach had shrunk in a little bit, and I felt a lot more energetic and overall kind of … good? I got the courage to scale myself for the first time in probably six months, and I realized I had managed to get to 59.8 Kg, which was so fricking awesome. I started to really enjoy going for my midnight walks. But then it all went downhill.\n\nIt started with my college exams. I was super busy so I was like, okay, I need to go all out and study as much as I can. I didn't even realize that I was skipping my workouts until my exams were over and summer break began in July. I told myself, okay, I'm going to restart my workout routine, and now that I have more time than ever I can get myself in top shape by the time next semester starts.\n\nWhat a fucking lie I told myself.\n\nBy the time week 1 of my holidays were done I felt so lazy and lethargic everyday I didn't even want to get out of bed.

You know. Like Po from Kung Fu Panda. Whenever I feel tired, or sad, or feel anxious in any way, I'll binge on a lot of food. Like, a lot. Not helpful at all.\n\nIt's been nearly two months now. I haven't scaled myself, and I don't need to, because I know what it will say. I have felt very … hopeless. Like, I knew and recognized the problems but even then I couldn't bring myself to it. I even set alarms and timers and did everything to remind me I need to work out, but at the end of the day it all boiled down to my lack of will. I just … couldn't do it.\n\nSo, I've decided that I need to change my strategy.\n\nYou see, I detest routine. I despise it. I love being spontaneous in my actions. On some days, I'll be super energetic. But on most days, I feel very tired, very anti-social, or very limited in energy. Forcing myself into a routine that requires me to do the same thing everyday is something that could only work if everyday of my life was a good day. But it isn't.

I'm going to try my best to stay in motion, like if I'm doing nothing or I'm just on my phone, then I'm going to walk around my house or just make sure I'm not sitting. This would also help me in fixing my sleep schedule. If I find myself energetic enough to finally to do a proper workout, then I'll do so, but I'll make sure to do the bare minimum for now, no matter what type of day it is.\n\nWell, that's my plan, anyway. I'm really disappointed that I couldn't reach my goal in these five months, but I want to forgive myself because, well, if I don't then who else will. I would like a better strategy if there is one though, or maybe a tip that would help me in the long run. Also, sorry if this sounds cringe.

Long post ahead.\n\nA few years ago (2018-2020), I went through a significant and successful weight loss journey where I lost roughly 40lbs (25F, 168lbs to 130 lbs) and was finally at a place where I loved and was proud of my the body I had achieved. In May of 2020, I moved into a new city for grad school and though I was still trying to maintain my weight/progress, I slowly began to introduce unhealthy food and stopped counting calories. I picked up on the "intuitive eating" type of diet and it was working well for me, so much so that I felt like I had finally reached a point in my weight where I was at a "set point" and no longer had to worry so much about the food I was putting into my body. Fast forward to fall of 2021, I noticed my clothes started to fit tighter than before and came to realize I gained about 5 lbs. No problem, I thought, I\'ll just watch what I eat (aka consume less alcohol and junk) but continue to live life as usual. I\'m now at the point where I\'m at least 10+ lbs heavier than 2020 me, and I\'m honestly confused what led to this since my eating habits have truly not changed that much. I eat relatively healthy throughout the week, but I also don\'t restrict myself when theres something I really want (like ordering fast food, ice cream, etc), which is what I had been doing for two years post-weight loss and what I assumed was a healthy relationship with food. I\'m frustrated because I\'ve been going to the gym and really focusing on my diet in recent months to combat this but nothing has changed. Has anyone else dealt with a similar scenario? This may seem inconsequential, but as someone who has struggled with their appearance and body image their entire lives, the recent shift in my weight has been really affecting me mentally.'}, {'Recovery': 'I Stopped Trying To Lose Weight to Focus on My Mental Health … and Finally Lost Weight  [Face gains from June to August because I know this sub loves pictures](https://imgur.com/a/u5X2eP2)\nThe last few years have been rough for me mental health wise, which I’m sure many of you all understand. This year I was diagnosed with depression and ADHD and decided to focus on my mental health for a while instead of physical. Through the med changes, having a job I hated, and two rounds of COVID I eventually ended up at the doctor in June at 5’2 and 182 pounds with the beginnings of high blood pressure. (Combination of my medications and inactivity)\n\nHowever, I’ve yo-yo’d dieted since I was 12 and refused to do that cycle again because it always ends up with me being higher than I was. My personal choice was to not calorie track or weigh myself because, for myself, it leads to obsessive behavior and unsustainable habits.\n\nI saw a post from someone that really spoke to me. The person said instead of having a goal weight they had goal habits and whatever body that sustained those habits was the body they would have. There’s no goal date it’s whatever pace my body wants and most important I want all these habits to be sustainable\n\nSo I made a list of simple habits I wanted to incorporate. Instead of tracking my weight or measurements I track these habits and my workout progress\n\n1. Get more steps in. I worked from home so this was gradual I went from 3000 to 5000 to 7500 as my goal. I increase this goal every one to two months.\n\n2. I fell in love with spin class so I go whenever I want. At least once a week but normally more like 2 or 3.\n\n3. Strength training. My goals were simple I wanted to be able to squat my body weight and do a pull up. I follow GZCLP and try to train 2-4x a week but I’m flexible because I’m young and it’s summer.\n\n4. Eat fat, protein, and carbs at every meal and snack to try to make it as filling as possible.\n\n5. Cook at home as much as possible. But still be completely free to go out with friends or try new foods without guilt \n\n6. Eat breakfast. I noticed I overeat if I don’t eat breakfast because I tend to forget to eat while working. So I always have a filling breakfast and this has dramatically decreased hunger throughout the day\n\n7. I don’t track calories. But I am mindful of my protein intake to support my strength goals. I shoot for around 140g\n\n8. Stay hydrated!\n\n9. Sleep 7-8 hours even if it means sacrificing a workout \n\n10. Eat as many different fruits and vegetables in a day as I can. This is a game I play with myself where I count how many different ones I eat a day. It really forces me to be creative and not get bored with my food.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT … I did not set all these goals at once I gradually added them in if I noticed they made me feel good or helped my workouts. The focus wasn’t my weight but on being healthy and getting stronger. \n\nWell today I hit a major goal of squatting my body weight goal of 185. But then I wondered if 185 was actually my body weight and I checked and I’m actually down to 162! 20 pounds lost and I haven’t stressed about food. I go out and drink with friends. I have been on two week long vacations where I tried so many delicious foods. No ‘binging’ or ‘overeating’ I just ate like a normal person and did physical activity I really really love and enjoy. Everything I’ve done for the last few months I can do easily for the rest of my life it genuinely hasn’t been hard and I’ve enjoyed it so much.\n\nHonestly the weight is the least of the benefits. \n\n1. I am so confident in both my body and ability now. I know it may not be “perfect” to other people but I look damn good to myself and that’s what I care about.\n2. My mental health has drastically improved. I am genuinely so happy. My medication works a million times better when I’m exercising\n3. I’m more adventurous. I went hiking in the mountains by myself because I wanted to move my body! I’ve tried pole dancing and rock climbing. I have a list of physical things I can’t wait to try\n4. I LIFT SO MANY HEAVY THINGS. Like … I CAN SQUAT A WHOLE PERSON\n5. I used to hate getting dressed to leave the house because things weren’t fitting right. Now I’m so comfortable in my clothes and I love shopping again \n6. I take pictures now. I have no full body before pictures because I literally went months avoiding cameras. Now I take pictures all the time and this has let me capture so many amazing memories with friends and family \n\n\nNone of this would have been possible if I didn’t take that break to focus on my mental health. My medication gives my the energy and impulse control to actually maintain all these habits and avoid the all or nothing mentality I’ve fallen victim to so many times. It’s not a race, build good habits and your body will follow.\n\nI don’t have a goal weight just more goal habits 😊 but I’m so excited to see what I’ll be able to do by this time next year. \n\nI love me and I’m so proud of me and I just hope this helps someone else the way that other post helped me.\n\n[Face gains from June to August](https://imgur.com/a/u5X2eP2)'}, {'Recovery': "Losing a competition I started  Hey guys, 20F 183lbs here. I'm in need of some serious advice. During the summer, my boyfriend and I ended up gaining lots of weight, because all we did was just eat, sleep, and play games. To stop it, I thought it would be a good idea to have a competition of who could lose the most by winter break, where the loser has to buy whatever item the winner wants. I figured that since I'm going back to college, I'll have lots of motivation and no distractions. But it's only been two weeks and I'm already failing.\n\nBetween adjusting to roommates, starting classes, and starting my very first internship, I've just been feeling overwhelmed and stressed. I don't get much sleep, I stay up late doing homework because my internship is during the morning and I have classes in the evening, and I'm constantly eating at least 200 cals above my limit. I want to attend group classes, but by the time I have to get to the gym, I change my mind and just stay home because I'd rather just sleep. I'm trying my hardest to eat healthier and less, but I find that lately I've been wanting to just chow down on chinese, burgers, or seafood when I'm stressed. I'm so ashamed of myself because he's already lost 10 pounds and is exercising more often, meanwhile I only lost 4.

I have been mostly overweight to obese my whole life. After a full mental break down I really went up the scale to 83 kg (which on my 155 cm is a lot!). I haven't been below 66 from 13 until I finally started losing at 20. I went down to 60 kg from 70 and thought I looked ok. Then I went up to 83, the highest number I mentioned above. Now gainind 20 kg in such a short time frame really fucked my body up. I developed a lot of stretch marks and I don't think my body handled it well. My mental health though was sooo much worse. \n\nI started working on mental health (psychiatrist, psychologist and medication). I can't say it was easy, but after 7 years of therapy I feel like I am definitely in a much better place with my mental health. I struggle still and probably always will. But after that I went down to 48 kg from the previously mentioned 83. I took me 3 to 4 years, but by 25 I was 48 kg. The biggest issue at that time was loose and saggy skin (boobs and underbelly). I went to a plastic surgeon to look at my options, but didn't go through with it. \n\nBack to my mental health struggles it was. I had never had a boyfriend, kiss or anything at 25 and I felt awful about it. I think the thought that I keep struggling with is 'different, abnormal, not normal'. I started putting myself out there and let's say it didn't give great results. One guy who was obsessed with me being tiny and skinny. Totally obsessed with looks and very superficial. But you know low self esteem. I slept with him on the 3rd date (my first time). It was awful... lost even more self esteem and confidence and felt extremely low. In that state I started talking to this other guy who was clearly just looking to sleep with me, me being insecure about how inexperienced I was tried it out. Let's say it wasn't much better. Then I fell in love. This guy was sweet and nice. I thought he really liked me, never slept with me said he respected me too much for that. Something me has always felt that maybe he found out I used to be fat and cut his losses. I don't know he never gave me an explanation ever. He just didn't want to be with me. One day he had feeling another he didn't. One day he saw a future, the next he wanted to end it before it turned bad. He said nothing was wrong with me and I shouldn't let his emotionlessness ruin my life. But in my head I think it's because of me. I am not good enough. \n\nWell after this whole shit show which went on for about 2 years filled with mix signals and me completely going under. I gained back 15 kg. Leaving me at 63-64. I have started losing weight again and am now around 59-60 kg. Loose skin however is still there and all the feelings from before are back. That nobody will ever love me because I am abnormal or weird. The loose skin makes my body look old and gross while I am still young (my opinion and feeling, please don't let these words effect you). I decided to get surgery and go back down to around 52-53 kg which I think is a good weight for me. But I still feel awful because even with the surgery I will know how abnormal I am. How weird. And I will always feel as though I am lying to people when they look at me. Because I might look normal, but deep down I think I am not. \n\nI really want to get to a place where I make peace with myself and my body. Where I don't constantly devalue myself and talk/think of myself as awful and unworthy. But it's hard. \n\nI am having surgery in 4 months time in December. And I hope that by that time I love myself as much as possible and I love my body as well. Because even after surgery I will have flaws. I won't look perfect and I won't be perfect. \n\nFor the first time ever I think I want to really love myself instead of trying to change it all. I want to just be proud of myself for being me.

As of this morning i am 49.4 lbs down and under 200 lbs for the first time in over a decade! I’m a female, 5 ft 8, 30 years old, and now weigh 199.8. I started losing weight a little over a year ago after a friend told me she was concerned about my health. At the time I was a heavy cigarette smoker, worked at Starbucks and ate sweets/drank heavily sweetened drinks nonstop, and had just become really sedentary in general. I lost the first 20ish lbs very slowly by going on more walks, no longer eating as much food at work, and making some (but definitely not all, lol) healthier choices. It took me about a year. \n\nAfter losing 20 lbs, i started to see a difference in my body and began working on losing weight with a lot more focus. In May of this year I began intermittent fasting. I eat from 12-8 PM every day and this window seems to work well for me. I also quit smoking cigarettes in May. A month ago, I started counting calories in addition to IF. I try to stay below 1200 calories a day but often have one day a week where I eat closer to 1400. The missing piece for me is exercise. I still go on long walks but I think being more active is going to be important for me in losing the next 50 lbs. \n\nOverall it’s been a fun journey!

I know that doesn't seem like much but it's an improvement on what I would usually be doing otherwise which is sitting on my butt all day. I don't leave the house often due to severe anxiety however by starting this small change I have improved other aspects of my mental health (getting dressed and brushing my hair everyday). Currently walking the same route everyday which also involves walking up a few hills and my health app says I'm burning 175 calories doing this. This is low impact exercise to help me get off the starting block and save my joints since I'm still so heavy (and I can't swim so that's not an option) I've not gone for the complete diet overhaul like I have in the past which didn't get me far due to lack of exercise but to be honest I haven't been eating much recently due to issues with my teeth (all those years of sugar addiction).

I have failed for 3 years and finally turned it around!\n\nI list the problems i had and the solutions that i used to help me with them.\n\nProblems:\n\n* We all know that it is about energy balance/CICO(calories in vs calories out) but it\'s hard when you see how little it is what you can eat and what you have to cut out to even stay within your deficit. Difficult eater(will probably get shit for it but some of us really just cant get certain "healthy" foods in)\n* I have an office job so i dont burn alot of calories on activity, this one is probably the one that is the biggest problem for most. i always thought i just had slow metabolism and other people where more lucky but research shits all over that one. just have to look at those people and they probably move around alot on a day to day basis(or just eat less maybe both).\n* I have done alot of yoyoing with my weight never getting the right result and one of the reasons was that i only looked at CICO and i forgot about taking in enough protein to keep as much muscle as possible, i did do resitance training but with just way to low protein in take i lost way to much everytime\n* Cheat days because i used to eat the foods that i actually didnt want to i needed to have cheat days or there was no way of keeping with the diet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSolutions:\n\n* Find foods you can eat everyday that are still decent but being able to eat food that you love will make it significantly easier to stick to a diet, just make sure you stay within your deficit, i love yoghurt and strawberries which i can eat everyday and strawberries are a good volume for low calories which helped me alot with not always feeling hungry, make sure you dont change your diet to some unrealistic style of foods you know you wont eat the next week anyways, you have to make it fit you.\n* I started walking 10.000 steps a day(for me that is about 500 calories burned) which gave me lots of calluses still pushed through to get those steps in, after the calluses settled i switched to 20.000 steps a day(for me this is about 1000 calories burned) and i know this is alot but i found that this helped significantly in helping me lose the weight. \n* Eating yoghurt that i love with high in protein and buying extra whey protein powder helped me keep my protein intake at the right levels\n* this points to the first solution make sure to make your diet to your liking that it will always be a cheat day but your not cheating on calories\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni hope people might find some off this helpfull, just make sure to keep pushing to your goals and you will make it eventually!'}, {'Neutral': 'Fitness progress?

I came from a broken home and ate a lot to cope, I was unsupervised a lot, eating in anticipation of being nervous around a physically and emotionally abusive father and a strung out mother. I was poor and as you can imagine I ate a lot of junk food, I overindulged often at my grandparents on the weekend because they always spoiled me and they never said no. I don't blame them but I was just a child and it led to a lot of bad habits leading into my teens and eventually into adulthood. I was always the biggest kid at any school I ever went to, I was bullied constantly, mostly verbally but I often let my anger turn into physical violence. I became so withdrawn from everything that eventually I just didn't want to be around people, I ditched high school to the point that I didn't even know half of my teacher's names. Thankfully there was a program in my city that allowed troubled youth to meet with a teacher one on one once a week and you did all your work from home, I was still able to graduate high school. I was still stuck in a really shitty living environment surrounded by drug addicts and low lifes. By the time I was 18 I had moved over 20 times, I never had stability and eventually ended up living with my grandparents. I was depressed and extremely resentful of my parents, I often blamed all my problems on them and I let it eat away at me. My grandpa passed and I was so angry all the time and then my father passed, even though he was a piece of shit it still had a huge impact on me. I became socially withdrawn, things I enjoyed were no longer fun, there were points where I didn't leave the house for months and maybe even years at a time. I did a few work from home jobs and since I really didn't have any bills living with my grandmother I just cruised through a big portion of my life. I didn't make a lot of money but I made enough to be content with what I had and I didn't really care for anything, I had no interest in going out with friends, didn't want to pursue girls and just thought that would be my life forever, dying at a young age. I was so isolated that I eventually became agoraphobic, I would get physically ill if I had to leave my house. I became socially awkward...even to extended family. I was terrified of leaving the house, often even just toughing out medical issues because the thought of dying was better than having to go to the hospital. I lost hearing in one ear from letting an infection fester when a simple trip to the ER would have cleared it right up with antibiotics. My biggest regret was not going to my best friend's wedding because I was too scared to leave the comfort of my own home, I gave him some really lame excuse that I was sick when in reality I was at home playing video games and binging on food.    \n\nYear after year went by like this, eventually I was over 500lbs. My only social interactions were with friends I met online and I kept up a pretty good façade of being just a normal guy, I lost myself in video games and online culture. I had a really close female friend that I played games with often, eventually I started getting feelings for her. It became too much, I was so infatuated with her to the point it pained me being around her. I would disappear for weeks at a time because I thought the feeling would eventually pass, I didn't think anyone would want to be in a relationship with someone like me and I was full of self pity. Once I realized my feelings weren't subsiding I gathered up the courage and sent her an email explaining my absence and confessing my feelings for her. She sent me back a really sweet message and had told me the feelings were mutual. For the first time something good had happened to me, I felt a bit of happiness that I've never experienced before in my life. I started getting motivated, I knew I needed to start taking my health seriously and that pushed me to start my weight loss journey. I was in love, something completely alien to me but she is amazing. The more I got to know her, the closer we became as we shared a lot of similar struggles regarding weight and being self-conscious. At that point we had no idea what the other person looked like and we decided to exchange pictures. She is beautiful and I remember blushing like crazy looking through the pictures she sent me, I was intimidated and also terrified that she wouldn't find me attractive. We've been in a long distance relationship coming up on two years and plan on meeting for the first time in a few months, she's amazing, she's my best friend and I've never felt judged by her. We motivate each other, she's perfect and I genuinely feel as if she saved my life.    \n\nThank you for listening to my ramblings, I'm not sure why I decided to tell my story but it feels good, I'm happy and I hope you find your inspiration as well, whatever or whomever it may be."}, {'Recovery': '123 lbs down in the last 12 months!

So far my routine is 10 push ups, drink, 20 squats, drink, 10 push ups and repeat abt an hour later or less depending on timing or injuries or hw. As school is starting again soon, I won’t have as much time so I’ve got to make the most out of these two weeks, I know it isn’t a good routine but it’s the only thing I can think of/do as I’m on a budget, I do usually do planks and running. I don’t expect to lose all my weight in 2 weeks, I expect it to take a couple of months. Now I know that a gym isn’t the key to losing weight but what I am trying to say by that is that I have limited resources. I have done my research aswell. I don’t expect people to do things for me and as I assume people from this subreddit are/were in the same situation as me.

In a way it was my fault, but he didn\'t help the situation. Our main bonding was food related. He was also diabetic/pre-diabetic himself and obese and we probably enable each other bad habits. Whenever I tried to change, it would barely last a day or two before there was "Hey babe, let\'s eat at this buffet!" \n\nWhat was hurtful was he admitted he lost attraction to me since I reached 212 lbs, the sex became non-existent the last few months. We ended up taking a 1 month break to work on ourselves (Per each other\'s request and acknowledgement of our issues). During this 1 month, I ended back at 193 lbs. Despite this, he still wasn\'t sure about his feelings for me and we broke up.\n\nIt wasn\'t like I lost weight for him. I didn\'t like what I was becoming, but during the break I was motivated to try to be the best person again and work on myself to gain the clarity.   \n\nI guess long story short, how do I keep up the motivation/discipline especially since we broke up, I feel devastated and shaken and most of all discouraged.'}, {'Disordered': 'Feeling fuller way faster?

Hi everybody! First post here since I was like 17, so about four years ago! My sophomore year of high school I decided to make a change and went from about 190 pounds to about 150 in only five or six months! I was so proud of myself, and I managed to keep it off for a year or so. Around my senior year I got super into weed, and combining that with going off to college, and then throwing quarantine in there, my weight was in a ROUGH place. This June I decided I was gonna finally make a change, and I just knew in my head I truly meant it that time. At the end of June when I made that decision, I weighed about 226 pounds. Today, after recently joining a gym and seriously really trying to lose weight, along with quitting smoking, I'm officially down to 216 pounds. I know it's not a lot for most people, but I'm just really proud of myself for finally doing this! Hoping to get to around 180, and am genuinely looking forward to the journey to get there!

I\'m posting because I have hit my goals and I am realizing just how big of a difference having a supportive partner makes. \n\nMy boyfriend is a fit, muscular guy who loves the gym. I was at an okay weight when we got together (5\'5", 156 lbs) but I was out of shape and I hated my body/the way I had suddenly gained 45 lbs since 18. My journey started with him basically dragging me to the gym with him and with me feeling constantly hurt that he wanted to change my body. I broke down to him about this and he sat me down to say, "I never want you to feel that way. I think you\'re the most beautiful thing in the world, but I can see how badly you see yourself. You literally can\'t expect to look like you did when you were a teenager, so why are you beating yourself up? Do you think your body won\'t change in your life? When you have children? When you get older? I just wanted you to get strong so you can believe in yourself and feel confident at any stage, because guess what?? This ultimately has NOTHING to do with how your body looks and EVERYTHING to do with how you feel about it." \n\nThat conversation blew me away and has stuck with me. This whole time I\'m really lucky to have had unwavering support, reassurance that it was okay to slip up or take a break, and someone to say "I\'m proud of you" for both my physical and mental progress. When I started going down a dangerous path of restricting my food too much, he was there to say "let\'s eat together, I don\'t want you skipping this meal." I\'m stronger than ever (again, mentally and physically) and down to 120 lbs now where I will be maintaining. \n\nThe best of luck to everyone who might see this and keep it up.

Didn't want to see the scale read 200 so I started working on my calorie intake and started working out, mainly lifting weights. 5 months of that and I was down to 184.5. Unfortunately I hurt my back squatting, perhaps a bulging disc. Seen a couple docs, they gave me stretches to do which didn't seem to help. I haven't tried physical therapy yet because I did that for some tennis elbow and it was expensive and honestly didn't seem like nothing I couldn't have done on my own, for that case at least. That kind of shut down my weight loss and I stayed in the mid to upper 180's till about may.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDecided I needed to start doing something again, started doing a 100 body weight squats a day challenge. This actually did seem to help my sore back some, but I still stopped after the 30 days. Back pain started to worsen again so I started trying to squeeze in some body weight squats whenever I can and started doing some weight lifting again, but with light weights, like just the bar for squatting.

So while I might be below 1500 calories a day, I am not below 10,500 calories average for the week. I also started this plan before I started walking, so I probably need to update my activity level which should give me more calories to eat. And I guess thats my biggest question, am I not eating enough? I've heard of starvation mode, but my understanding is the simple math says more calories out than calories in and you should lose weight right? I also do not eat back the calories I lose from walking. So I am eating at what i should to lose about a pound a week and then losing another 750 calories a week from walking. So I should be losing like 1.25 Lbs a week. This did help me get down to the Mid 170's, but I've been stuck there for about 2 months. Not sure why the weight loss would have stopped.

If I EVER overeat - even if just by a tiny little bit - my gut will be excessively messed up for the next couple of days:\n\nStarting from about noon to as late as 9 in the evening I will feel *extremely* hungry. Hungry to such a degree that it feels like it would be unhealthy *not* to eat. So I'll eat to try and stop the pain. I'll reach my calorie goal (still hungry). I'll reach my maintenance calories (still hungry). I'll go over (at this point I'll usually have stopped tracking my calories anyway). At some point I'll finally stop. Usually, I'll still be hungry, but at least not in pain. \n\nEverything will seem fine and dandy for 1-3 hours until suddenly BAM I'll get smacked in the face with an incredibly uncomfortable feeling of being stuffed (think: you had Christmas dinner and are stuffed, but still forced yourself to eat some cake to not hurt Aunt Marge's feelings. That kind of stuffed.). I'll feel uncomfortable just moving around, just the thought of food will make me feel sick to my core.\n\nBuut since I overate again the cycle will repeat for the next day. And the next. And so on until eternity or until I finally manage to break out again.\n\nThe only way I've managed to break the cycle is to basically ignore my body screaming at me for several days, until my gut and my hunger signals finally return to normal. The funny thing is that it's almost *easy* for me to lose weight at this point, it's like my body naturally wants to eat a bit less than what my current maintenance calories would be. \n\nI've never heard of anyone's gut and hunger signals getting messed up this bad from overeating just once.

August 29, 2022  # Is today is your Day 1?\n\n\u200b**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!\n\n\u200bSo you aren’t sure of how to start? Don’t worry! “How do I get started?” is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.\n\n# Why You’re Overweight\n\nOur bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.\n\n# Before You Start\n\nThe very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.\n\n# Tracking\n\nHere is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends (unaffiliated) apps like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit](http://loseit.com/) or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers. You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)\n\n# Creating Your Deficit\n\nHow do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.\n\n# Exercise\n\n...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.\n\nIt has it’s own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \\*awesome\\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.\n\n# Crawl, Walk, Run\n\nIt can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn’t necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.\n\n# Acceptance\n\nYou will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.\n\nDo not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don’t need perfect. We just want better.\n\n# Additional resources\n\nNow you’re ready to do this.

If you are dairy free, other protein powder or protein rich food would work.\n\nI’ll be moving some of my breakfast yogurt to night because I don’t see any harm in it and if I can get a 0.1% advantage, or whatever it may be, with no effort, I’ll take it.'}, {'Recovery': 'Down 111 pounds and an obesity class - my lessons so far  Some stats to start with: SW: 387 CW:276 GW: ~150 5\'10" 34 Male.\n\nAs the title says - I am down ~110 pounds from starting weight, and I still have plenty to go. But it\'s definitely noticeable, and I\'ve been getting questions (and comments!) lately in real life, so I figured I\'d share the answers here too, for those interested.\n\n"What\'s the secret!?!"\n\nAnswer: CICO. Calories In/Calories Out. It\'s really that simple. My body, as all human bodies, obeys the laws of thermodynamics. If you give it less calories than it needs for the day, day after day, it\'ll use that stored potential energy for its needs.\n\n"What diet are you on?"\n\nThe CICO diet. Now, to be fair, I did change my diet a bit. Less fast food, more \'healthy\' foods. I added a meal replacement shake to my daily intake. But there are still some days on occasion when I go thru a drive-thru and get a burger and fries. I budget those meals into my calories for the day.\n\n"What\'s your exercise routine?"\n\nThe CICO exercise plan. This is the other side of CICO - increasing the number of calories you spend in a day. Cardio is good for this. Hit the treadmill or hop on a bike, or both if you feel up to it. I started at like, 1.2mph on the treadmill, and 1.7mph took the wind out of me. Now I\'m at 3.7mph for my \'rest\' cycles, and 4.6mph for my peaks. Conditioning will happen naturally over time.\n\n"Do you have more energy/feel healthier?"\n\nHell yes! Now, I thought I was fine before, because I could still get around. Sure, a flight of stairs might of winded me, but we have elevators at work so it\'s cool, right? Nope. Now I can climb flights and flights of stairs without being winded. And the back pain that I had from \'just getting older\'? Turns out, that went away with the weight, despite me not getting any younger. Funny how that worked out!\n\n"Do you plan to keep losing?"\n\nYes. You can throw my stats into any BMI calculator and see I\'m still way heavier than I should be. (I honestly don\'t even know why someone would ask me this - I carry the weight well, sure, but it\'s clear I\'ve still got plenty to lose.)

SW 250, GW 165, CW 192  29 year old male, 5\'9". I have lost about 58 lbs so far. I have been lurking on this sub along my entire journey and learning a lot from everyone even though this is my first post.\n\nI started trying to lose weight on March 1st of this year. The birth of my son was a wake up call. I was having trouble with simple things like being out of breath carrying him, getting up and down off the floor, knee pain, acid reflux, etc. I want to be around longer for him and I knew the extra weight was probably the core of my problems.\n\nSo I started dieting and exercise. I am lucky. I dropped from 250 to 195 on a 1700 calorie a day budget fairly quickly and easily. I hit 195 lbs around the beginning of August. All was good. I have started working out a little harder (because I finally can). I went from simple walking, to doing some HIIT workouts (shout out to Juice & Toya YT channel), alternating walking and jogging on the treadmill, and lifting weights. Workouts are typically about 3 days a week. I usually walk a couple miles on my non "workout" days.\n\nSince the beginning of August my weight has just been bouncing around between 191 and 195 lbs. I have changed nothing about my diet. I have tracked everything via the LoseIt app since I began losing weight. I don\'t believe my diet / calories to be the issue. I eat pretty clean. Veggies, fruit, fish, not a lot of red meat.\n\nI\'m also a little concerned because I still have almost 30 lbs to go, and even with all the effort and dieting I am only maintaining right now. If this is how hard I have to work just to maintain 195, I don\'t know how I am going to be able to maintain an even lower weight. \n\nI guess I am just starting to get frustrated and am looking for some tips, words of encouragement, ideas, I don\'t even know. I just am starting to question my sanity with this whole situation. I hiked over 6 miles yesterday and only ate around 1500 calories. I was excited thinking the scale would show some results this morning. Nope, still 193. It doesn\'t make sense to me. \n\nOne interesting thing is though, I still feel like my body is getting smaller even though the scale isn\'t changing. I had some size medium shirts that didn\'t fit me a month ago, and I tried them on yesterday and I was so happy to be able to fit into them again. I had a pair of size 32 waist pants that I can finally fit in again - they also didn\'t fit a month ago. \n\nThanks to everyone in this community.

Hey all I'm 21f/5'8/186\n\nI've always had issues with my weight and have had body dysmorphia since I can remember. I used to overeat as a kid because I thought I was already fat so why not? Eventually I ended up actually getting up there with my weight. I hit my highest weight when I was 16/17 I hit 246lbs, I then lost 75 pounds over two years and hit 170. I wish I could tell you I lost that weight healthily, but it was from being homeless and walking everywhere and eating little to nothing lol, and I lost 20 pounds of that from ecstasy.\n\nSo when I got pregnant I lost 10 pounds because I was sick everyday, but around 6 months I gained 40 pounds and was back to 200. after giving birth i Lost 15 and went down to 185, but I ended up gaining it back when I went on birth control and hit 202.\n\nWell this month, I cut out as much processed food as possible, and went from drinking 5 large McDonalds sodas a day, to only drinking water, with the occasional cup of juice. this has been my saving grace. Water keeps me so much more full and energized throughout the day. I eat anywhere from 1100-1300 calories a day, and started going for 2 hour walks 2 weeks ago, and I have lost 16 pounds putting me at 186! I don't know what my final goal weight is but for now I am aiming small so I wanna hit 170 in the next month and a half/2months!\n\nOne of the biggest thing that has helped me is looking at all the nutrition facts and not just the calories! Although I have been using CICO :)\n\nAnd I've still let myself enjoy all the foods I like, just with the right portion size, throughout this whole month I have had pizza, chinese food, halal food, and ice cream multiple times lol.

Some backstory. \n\nI, 27yo, 5”7M, weighed in a month ago at 143lb which was the heaviest I’ve ever been. I was always super skinny but somehow the fat crept up on me and I didn’t notice it until I looked down one day and thought “fuck”. Cue an entire month of an extremely strict diet with 1600 calories a day and 5 days a week working out. In a month I’ve shed 4lb and weigh in at 137lb which is more or less where I want to be (somewhere between 134-138lb). I’m pretty proud of this - I still have a bit of stomach chub but other than that, I’m really happy with my progress and my weight and I feel like I’m now at a healthy weight where I look and feel good.\n\nSo what now? Maintaining my current plan is going to mean I continue to lose weight and I don’t want to be as skinny as I used to be. I do want to continue to lose belly fat and working out as I’m liking the results so far. But I’m scared to increase the calories too much and let the weight climb back up.

Im 6ft6inches, and im currently 260 lbs. I started Intermiteng fasting (16/8) arround 4 months ago, my starting weight was 288 lbs and it really helped turn my life arround, not only i feel better but it helped motivate me to join the gym again after 4 years of a sedentary life, as well as counting my calories and being more consious about what i eat. \n\nIve been eating 2000 calories monday to friday, and on the weekends i dont count calories and let go a  little but not too much. Im doing weight lifting 3 times a week for about an hour each session and im also running arround 4 hours a week, usually divided in 5 days more or less. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe issue is this, theres this machine in the gym which measures body weight, body fat percentage, water weight, muscle weight etc... After 4 months i measured myself again, and eventough i lost almost 30 pounds, i also had some muscle loss, even tough i was doing weight lifting. \n\nWhat could be the reason for this, i need some help.\n\n\\-Is 2000 calories for weight loss enough or maybe too litle? (online calculators have given me so many different amounts that i lost faith in them.)\n\n\\-Am i doing too much Cardio, ive heard that can be an issue\n\n\\-Am i exerting myself too litle in weight training, should i increase the weights?\n\n\\-Im probably consuming arround 22% protein in avg. \n\nIm open to all sugestions.'}, {'Neutral': 'I\'m so out of shape, can I do this?  I\'m (40M, 5\'8", 305lbs) totally out of shape. I\'ve been overweight all my life. I managed to get down to 215lbs when I was 30 years old by eating less and daily brisk walks.\n\nI\'ve been attempting to do the same for the past two weeks, all I can manage is walking about 2.5 miles a day that takes me about 50 minutes. I\'m out of breath, sweating like you wouldn\'t believe... to the point where I walk at night before bed such that other people don\'t see me because the sweating and heavy breathing is just pretty bad.\n\nI\'ve lost 2 pounds in the last two weeks. My daily calories are about 1600 to 1900 per day. I don\'t seem to lose weight as fast as I did 10 years ago... I don\'t feel like I can exercise much more, my body hurts everywhere as it is after the walks.\n\nOn the positive side, I see my cardio is improving a lot, the first 3 days I had to ait on a bench for 5 minutes in the middle of the walk and could manage only 1.5 miles per walk. Now I can do 2.5 without any pause.\n\nAm I on the right track here, should I cut more on calories to see more improvements? Try to do 2 walks a day?

Monday - Thursday I have structure and routine and find it easy to stick to my diet. I eat between 1400-1500 calories a day, go to the gym Monday and Wednesday and swimming on a Tuesday and Thursday. This is all so easy and I enjoy doing it! My downfall comes after I finish work on a Friday, I have no routine and get a feeling I should treat myself and relax a bit regarding foods but I often spiral out of control. For example this past weekend I've had domino's, five guys, kebab and McDonald's! I'm essentially undoing everything I've worked towards in the week but I really can't convince my brain that I need to stay consistent even on a Saturday. Any and all advice greatly welcomed and appreciated!"}, {'Disordered': "Little to No results so far  Hi , about two weeks ago, I started dieting and taking creatine to help me with the gym. I admit the first week I wasn't super strict with the diet but I was still in a calorie deficit. This week I have been great with my diet, but stepped on the scale and am still hovering at 230lbs(No loss). Is this due to the creatine and I should not be worried or what could it be?

This level of weight has been quite taxing on my short frame and my health has taken a negative turn because if it. I am determined to make a change, but I’m just scared to start. All the other times I’ve tried have been unsuccessful because I could not maintain eating the lower calories that are required for weight loss at my height. \n\nI’ve read comments on here of short women becoming successful because they were able to create a deficit through exercise. I think that path would work for me, but I am really just unsure how to start. I have never exercised much before and am beyond out of shape. Any help, stories, or encouragement with either eating as a short women or starting to exercise would be highly highly appreciated.

I have tried multiple digital scales (at least 4 or 5 different brands at this point), and EVERY single one of them gives a totally different reading every time. I have no idea how much I actually weigh so it’s impossible for me to know if I’m making any progress. I step on the scale, it says 218 lbs. I step off, let it zero out, get back on, it says 208 lbs. Try again, now it says 213 lbs. It’s infuriating. I’ve tried moving the scales to multiple different locations in my house, thinking maybe it could be an issue with my floor not being level, but to no avail. Does anyone have any scale suggestions? I desperately need one that is accurate. I know that weight fluctuates daily, but not by the minute. I’m going insane and if I don’t find one soon I fear I might just give up all together. Unfortunately I highly depend on seeing my numbers, and if I can’t know my weight I will not keep pushing myself. Thanks in advance!'}, {'Disordered': "Arm Fat Help!!  I've been dieting since this February and lost around 45 lbs with my CW at 118 lbs as a 5'2 woman. I've always had chonkier arms so I thought losing weight as a whole would slim them down, but the upper arms near the armpit is still obviously fat and sags down. My forearms look great, my hands look great, I have a slight belly, nothing too bad... But the upper arms... oooh boy... Even my chubby face that I've had forever slimmed down... \n\nI'm currently 23 years old, and I'm not sure how to get rid of it other than perhaps lifting weights. Are there any success stories? Do I just have to lose even more weight (like 105 lbs..)?
