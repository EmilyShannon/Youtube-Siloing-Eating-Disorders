Neutral,"Getting to a milestone!  This might seem like a bit of a silly goal, but one thing I really want to work up to is being able to do ten full, proper form push-ups. I feel like a lot of the work I need is in my chest muscles and my abs. Anyways, yesterday I did 3 sets of 5 assisted push-ups. It’s really exciting because when I started working on this, I was only able to do really inclined ones against walls and other tall things. 
I feel like My goal is actually achievable, and I’m feeling stronger which is super important to me. I still have a decent amount of extra weight which makes something like this quite difficult, but I thought I’d share my win!"

Disordered,"How do you know a workout/weight is too much for you?  Piggybacking off on a previous post about how exercise shouldn't cause debilitating pain (which I never realized either), how do you know when a workout is too much for you? 

Like me, I'm an obese woman with a sedentary lifestyle (thanks to wfh). I've been going to the gym and usually I'm able to manage fine and able to complete the workout, but there are some workouts when I can barely get through it and it's like I'm going to collapse. Somedays, I usually come home and pass out for a few hours because I'm so tired. Other days, I'm sore, but it's comfortable enough to manage. 

Where's the fine line between knowing you're pushing yourself enough and pushing yourself too much? Is it really as simple as starting a workout with a slightly higher weight and adjusting as needed? 

Because I've always been told by fitness 'professionals' (quotes because I'm not realizing that the most ripped people usually aren't the most knowledgeable) that you should push yourself otherwise you'll never see results."
Neutral,"Half Marathon in 2 Weeks?  Hi all!

I've wanted to run a half for the longest time, but never committed to doing it. I am a young (22F) individual with a running background (cross country in high school), who is currently physically fit. However, I haven't strictly trained running in a while -- the last 4 months or so my training has consisted of GPP and CrossFit workouts. The highest mileage I've ever hit on one run is about 7 miles.

About a month ago I ran a 4 mile Tough Mudder style event and it went fine. Similar to that race -- I'm not shooting for any time goals, I simply want to finish the half marathon and say I did it, finally check it off my bucket list.

I keep my sleep and diet in check for the most part (95% of the time), but would put more effort into hydrating leading up to the event.

If I take the race at a conversation pace, run every other day leading up to it (or similar), have energy gels on hand, etc., is it likely I could finish the race injury free? I have good running shoes (Saucony Kinvara 12), and a foam roller/stick/massage gun. I'm expecting soreness and blisters, but it wouldn't be debilitating, right? I have a history of shin splints/stress fractures from cross country, but I have been injury free since I hung up my spikes.

What are your thoughts? Skip this one and maybe train for another one? Or if my goal is just to finish, would I survive with minimal issues (ie: no major injuries)?"
Neutral,"Wait, are you NOT supposed to be in pain during/after exercise?  Just had a pretty shocking conversation with my partner; apparently it's fine if exercise leaves you sore in a warm, tired, burny muscle kind of way, even to the point where that's uncomfortable, but it SHOULDN'T result in actual pain? Like joint pain, limping, trouble moving around, bone pain, muscles that hurt too much to use afterwards even for days on end etc mean you've pushed yourself too far and have effectively injured yourself? Maybe I sound like an idiot but I'm mind blown.

I'm not somebody who exercises for fun, and every time I've tried to get into it I've stopped because, well, it hurts. I'm a real couch potato because pain is bad and so when I try to do even a full beginner routine it gets painful, and on the rare occasion it's not painful while finishing it it's definitely painful when I'm trying to crawl around the next day because moving sucks too much. I thought this was what everybody was doing, I thought exercise people were just ok feeling literally beaten up every day for the health benefits and that I just didn't want it enough to endure. But you're supposed to stop during the nice burny used muscle legs are tired and wobbly bit and not the ow I'm in too much pain to continue bit?!

I feel like an idiot. But workout culture is full of people saying no pain no gain, it's full of people pushing you to keep going and finish your reps even if you think you can't anymore - I really thought exercise was just supposed end with being unbearably painful. I've read a bunch about routines, I've even read most wiki pages here and lurk, but I've never seen anything address this. 

Am I literally the only person who thought exercise had to be painful? Is my partner totally wrong, and exercise does just genuinely hurt a lot but everybody is pushing through? What are your experiences of discomfort, pain and injuries during and after working out as reference?"

Disordered,"Which program would integrate with my current routine best?  **Background**: Been lifting on and off for 2+ years; work a sedentary work-from-home IT job, but pursuing a career that has fitness requirements.  In my mid-thirties, \~160lbs 5'2"".  I'm here because I'm a bit overwhelmed trying to pick a program that won't require 4-5 days on its own--hoping for some recommendations from users who have dabbled in a few things at once and can help me figure out what will be flexible enough for my schedule, but rigid enough so I don't have to spend my life planning my workouts.

**Programs I'm considering (so far--here's where I need Reddit's help):**

* **Strong Curves** \- I know there are some negative stories out there, but I've been told I can find this info for free.  Seems like there was a lot of thought put into the program and it's research-based, and that's what is important.
* **Renaissance Periodization** \- Simple Training Templates; I can pick exercises from a list, which means I can avoid equipment (cable tower, lat pull-down) that is seemingly always taken when I'm at the gym.  The Female Physique Templates are a bit too intense for what I am looking for right now, so I'd have to stick with the Simple ones.
* **Caroline Girvan** \- I don't know anything about her programs, but I keep seeing her name pop up.  There are a lot of options, so I'm a bit overwhelmed.  I'm trying to figure out if she's YouTube only, or if she has an app or template I can find based on my requirements.  I will be working out without access to a TV or large screen, so I don't want to follow a video.

**Goal**:  I want to be STRONG.  Physique results would be fantastic, but I want to get stronger so I have an easier time grappling with men who are much bigger than me.  Will first work on recomposition, so I'll be in a slight deficit as I begin a new lifting routine.  I have experience doing the diet/lifting thing, so I'm pretty tuned into when I need more rest/sleep/etc.

**Current**:  

* **Diet** \- Working with a Registered Dietitian (RD) to dial in on my nutrition, so I don't want a program that makes me follow diet recommendations or log anything with food--I want workouts ONLY.  My dietitian tailors my nutrients to my workouts, so I'll be in a slight deficit but making sure I'm eating enough to not have diminishing returns.
* **Cardio** \- ""Run"" 3 days per week.  These are mostly easy runs (for now), so I don't think they'll affect strength workouts, and vice-versa.  When I can, I run on days I'm not lifting.  I am building my mileage and effort very slowly, as I have had a number of running injuries in the past.  I supplement with activities like cycling when I feel like my shins need a break.
* **Lifting** \- I meet in-person with a personal trainer twice per week.  We do full-body workouts, but they skew slightly toward upper-body.

**What I need now:**

* **Two** additional strength workouts per week that are either full-body or skew toward lower-body.  I'd like to keep them at an hour or less per workout, and would prefer something that's integrated with an app or is easy enough to follow so I can log it on my phone.  I know myself--the more I have to manually log, the less likely I am to stick with it.
* Equipment found at a barbell gym (dumbbells, barbells, free weights, bands, pull-up bar); no access to traditional machines.
* Free or low-cost.  As you can imagine, working with a RD and PT is expensive, so I don't want to add too many more recurring costs.  A low monthly fee (<$15/mo) or one-time fee (<$100) is ideal.  Free is better, but I'd rather pay a little bit to have a forum or app access.

Does such a program exist?  I'm willing to slightly modify an existing one to fit into two days, within reason.  I have no problem stretching out a program to fit a compressed schedule (for example, taking 16 weeks to complete what is normally a 12 week program)."

Disordered,"[Program Review] Mag-Ort: breaking through a 6 month plateau.  **tldr;  hit 3 plates @ 126lb bodyweight.**

**background:**

Female, 18 years old. I started lifting when I was 16 and ran a loose version of 5x5 while also incorporating whatever accessory work I wanted. I started out as a stick with zero athletic background, so I had to build up from  ground zero. I have since ran nsuns, Candito 6wk, Jacked & Tan, SBS 3x Bench, Bulgarian Method, Candito Bench program.  I just lift for fun and because it makes me feel good.

I had ran Mag Ort before and finished it about six months ago. I went from a 265 single to hitting it for 5 on an amrap test, which set my 1ERM a little under 300lbs. Then, I tried running Coan-Phillipi deadlift program but I failed a 295 double and just was going through the cycle of redoing the week and then lowering my TM. I was spinning my wheels. On top of that, I'm a college student, so school got in the way a lot at one point and I couldn't train consistently. Between that 265 amrap and the start of Mag-ort, the heaviest I had pulled was an RPE 10 295 single shortly after my first run of Mag-Ort. Two months ago, 275 felt like an RPE 10. I felt very frustrated by my lack of progress. 

**how i ran the program:**

\- I pull sumo. You can find this program on liftvault. You deadlift once a week: 4x4, 1x2 @ 80%, 1x2 @ 90%, and then an AMRAP. Each week you add ten pounds to each set. That may be a little aggressive if you set your max too high/if your max is just relatively low (the program was written by very high-level deadlifters with very high maxes; a 10lb jump for someone with a 800 max is a much smaller percentage than for someone with a 300 lb max). I still hit each 10 lb jump, and I believe I could do that because 1) I had some previous practice with those weights because of Coan-Phillipi and 2) my recovery was the best it has ever been. I finally had some time away from school so I could eat and sleep consistently. When you can make lifting + recovery your priority, it's really hard not to see good progress, imo. I also skipped the rest weeks, so for me the program was 9 weeks long.

\- Didn't adhere to a strict diet. Lots of turkey/chicken/beef, veggies, yogurt, fruit, avocados, toast, eating out with friends. Probably averaging around 2.3k calories a day. I gained weight, but I don't hate how I look yet.

\- During the program, I've been running a tactical barbell program for my other two lifts. That's been going great, 10/10 recommend so far.

**In general, I am a firm believer that 95% of people in the gym do not train hard enough. So I hammered accessories and conditioning.**

\- I hit back every day cuz big back = big total, but otherwise i run an upper/lower split for accessories. I do banded reverse hypers daily (make my lower back feel fresh) and banded pull aparts between each set of bench. Other than that, it's a mix of RDL's, Kroc Rows, pull-ups, DB incline press, lat raises, hip thrusts, and lots of core work. Most people have a weaker posterior chain to start with, so that's what I focus on.

\- I walk a lot and do some form of conditioning (airdyne bike, plyometrics, pushing sled) at least three times a week. I find this to be ESSENTIAL. My lungs are *never* the limiting factor in the AMRAP deadlifts. I give up because I'm just tired from hitting a heavy-ass double two minutes before and don't want my form to break down too much. If your lungs are on fire and you can't breathe after a set of high-rep squats/deadlifts, that's a serious sign that you need to do more conditioning. Also if you have trouble eating more, then conditioning will make your appetite skyrocket.

**Overall thoughts/next steps:**

20 lbs in 9 weeks may not be mind blowing, but I gained so much confidence on this program that I don't care. Mag-Ort is a perfect mix of volume and intensity. Even after the 4x4, I never felt too tired to hit the heavy doubles. I could practice technique with the higher rep sets and build confidence with the doubles. The game is 80% mental, and this program really shows you that. As long as I trusted the program, I KNEW I was going to be able to hit my numbers. For example, I failed a 285 double on the second rep, but I calmed the fuck down and tried again. Lo and behold, I successfully completed the set. I find that a lot of time, my strength is there but my confidence/ focus is not. Running this program really allowed me to build confidence and really experience the focus/calmness needed to hit heavier weights. I really don't have anything negative to say about this program. It can take like an hour to finish? But I don't mind that.

I plan on just running this program until it stops working. I suppose my next deadlift goal is 365. That'd be sick."

I'm a teacher who comes home everyday feeling exhausted. At the moment I have a sedentary lifestyle other than the 7 to 10K steps I get at work or taking a little walk by the beach. I've been struggling with finding the motivation to add exercise back into my schedule. I thrive with a gym buddy but all of my friends either run (I've really tried... I just can't get into it) or go to expensive gyms out of my budget. 

Fitness goals: lose some weight (definitely put some on over covid), find more consistency with working out, more weight training, finding an affordable gym, dance classes (?)

Current set up: kettle bells, dumbbells, yoga mat, stand up paddleboard

Fitness history:
  
* 9-22 was in dance classes on and off. Definitely NOT athletic but it kept me moving.
       
* 18-now have been practicing yoga. Not regularly but I have flows memorized and consider myself moderate with strength and flexibility.
  
* 20-24 had a 24/hour gym membership in San Diego and had a gym buddy who had opposite skills from me. He would do weight training with me, and I'd drag him to yoga and zumba classes. But then I moved away. Apparently the 24/hr fitness gyms in my area now all have bad reviews for being unclean and broken down. 🙄
  
* 22-28 also didn't have a car so I walked A LOT more.   
  
* 26-28 Started indoor rock climbing with friends. Loved going and we went 3-4x a week. Felt stronger. But then covid happened. When the gym reopened we realized it wasn't an enjoyable experience to climb with a mask on since the gym DOESN'T HAVE AC. Way too brutal for us.  
  
* 29-now I have a stand up paddleboard and during the summer was going 2-3x a week. During the school year it's been tough to go more than once a week. 


What I guess I'm looking for is.. if anyone has gone through this inconsistent struggle with fitness. If anyone has any at home programs (dumbbell, body weight, yoga) they'd recommend I'd appreciate it. Also if anyone has any gym recommendations in the Long Beach/Orange County (California,USA) that have classes, not $50+/mo, and are inclusive. And on the off chance if anyone lives in this area who wants to go paddle boarding on weekends would be a delightful surprise!

Neutral,"Program Review: Candito 6-Week Powerlifting Program (3 Cycles)  Hi r/xxfitness !

I just finished my third full cycle of Candito's 6-Week Powerlifting Program and wanted to share what I learned and how it worked out for me.

# Background

* Played hockey for 11 years (2005 to 2016) so I am already familiar with form
* Working out and seriously weightlifting since August 2021 (couldn't even do a push-up at this point, I was extremely sedentary for 5 years cause competitive sports traumatized me lol)
* I weighed around 165 lbs @ 5'5 
* I used a leather lever belt for squat and deadlift
* I consume between 100g to 150g of protein a day
* I don't use creatine and I use pre-workout only on days when I am both squatting and deadlifting heavy

# Candito 6 Week: Pros

* Easily accessible on Boostcamp App or [here](https://liftvault.com/programs/powerlifting/peaking/jonnie-candito-6-week-strength-program-spreadsheet/)
* Excellent variety of accessory workouts. Each ""bench"" day allows for 1 horizontal pull, 1 vertical pull, and 1 vertical push of your choosing
* Excellent recovery management. The program tapers off the volume and replaces it with intensity as you advance through the weeks. At the end of each cycle, I included a deload week to really play it safe.
* Trains your through all rep ranges on the big three lifts (i.e. 1 rep maxes all the way up to AMRAP \[as many reps as possible\] sets).
* Not time-consuming as it ranges from 5 to 3 days a week, but if you can only make it to the gym 4 days a week (like me) you won't suffer because of it
* Gym sessions typically last 50 to 90 minutes (including warmup)

# Candito 6 Week: Cons

* Many people complain about the lack of bench volume, as you are only ever benching max 3 times per week and usually only 2 times per week. I don't find this a problem but its worth noting.
* Going from a deadlift PR on week 6, to the next cycle in Week 1 (even with a deload week) is really taxing. I found it led to me not being able to complete my deadlift sets Week 1 of a new cycle cause I was still recovering. For my 4th cycle, I will not be testing a 1RM on deadlift and just sticking with a 97.5% load and aiming for 2 to 4 reps and adjusting my training max as necessary.

# Adjustments

* The only major adjustment I made was testing my 1RM on Week 5 and treating Week 6 as a deload week. During my first cycle, I found my strength peaked at Week 5 and by the time I was ready to test my 1RMs on Week 6 I was too exhausted.

# Results

*Disclosure: I'm not an actual powerlifter and just enjoy training squat, bench, and deadlift. So my lifts might get red lights at meets (i.e. touch and go bench and wearing straps for deadlifts)*

Neutral,"Strength training for runners (podcast)  Jason Fitzgerald of the Strength Running podcast was [recently interviewed on another podcast](https://strengthrunning.com/2022/09/optimize-strength-training/), and basically gave a complete rundown of what strength training should (in his opinion) look like for runners. I know combining strength + running is a popular topic around here, so this may be worth a listen. It's geared toward folks who prioritize running and want to add strength training in service of that. (It's *not* about pursuing both goals equally, or about prioritizing strength, although if those are your goals you may still get something out of this.

Some takeaways:

* Start each run with dynamic warmup, then do 10-20 minutes strength training afterwards. These small amounts add up.
* Post-run strength training can be bodyweight-only (lunges, etc) or can incorporate dumbbells/kettlebells/bands when you're ready. For some runners, this may be all the strength training you need to do.
* If you want/need more, do 2 days in the weight room each week.
* DON'T train high reps/low weight to work endurance. You get lots of endurance training from runs. Use gym time to work on strength and power.
* Marathoners should do more power work (explosive stuff like plyometrics and even olympic lifts) compared to runners who mostly train for shorter races.
* As you taper for a race, taper your weight training too. Way less volume, but keep intensity up.

This is one coach's approach, so these aren't ironclad rules, but I would agree that they're pretty good things to keep in mind as guidelines if you're a runner."
Disordered,"Has anyone here achieved your goal body entirely through home-based workouts? Thinking about you weightlifters specifically.  Seems like the weightlifting programs I find that are designed to be done at home have a qualifier saying it’s not meant for serious muscle gains unless you’re a newbie. I’m technically a newbie in weightlifting (last time I was serious into weights was over twenty years ago) and I do feel myself getting stronger and leaner from when I started only 3 months ago. I’m starting to feel muscles in areas that used to be feel flabby. 

I guess my question is really around what I can realistically expect from weight training with mainly dumbbells at home. I have an adjustable dumbbell set that goes up to 24kg. I’m not expecting to get really jacked but I do want to look really muscular, like Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. Are there things I need to add to my setup that are essential to taking things to the next level, i.e. pull-up bar? Or is going to the gym inescapable (I really would rather not as the time and fees is just another barrier to motivation). TIA!"
Disordered,"Surgery recovery & fitness  Hey xxfitness, 

I’m a recomp noob looking for some advice :) 

I broke my foot last year & I have had two operations on it. My foot is now fixed, been approved to exercise etc. I have worked hard to get myself fit & healthy, but I’m struggling a little with understanding a few things about body recomp. I’m new to this, so any advice & support is welcomed.

I want to lose some fat & build muscle in a healthy, slow and sustainable way. 

1) To start this journey, I’m cycling to work 3 days a week (Mon-Wed , which totals 50km. I push myself hard to not stop cycling the whole way to work out. 
2) I’m eating 1,700-1,900 per day with 80-110g of protein. 

I find myself exhausted for the next two-three days after this exercise. 

I am I not eating enough? I want to do more weight lifting later in the week but I feel my body is telling me I need to rest/I’m tired & feel slightly week. On cycle days I eat more kcals, on rest days slightly less.

Or will my body get ‘used’ to this workout commute after a few more weeks since I have been inactive for so long? Once adapted, can I up my exercise to include weights?

I want to make sure I’m doing the right thing to build muscle & lose fat, and not put my body through too much too soon. 

Background: I was quite fit before my injury (ran 10k 1 x weekly, did a lot of walking ~10,000 per day minimum, weights 1-2 x weekly, martial arts 1 x weekly). Sadly I wasn’t eating enough (1,500kcal p/day for 2 years), and I have been advised my body has likely adapted to hold onto fat. I’ve been sedentary from November-May due to surgery.

Disordered,"What I learned after finishing my first ever weightlifting program  Just wrapped up an 8 week muscle and strength dumbbell program (found it on a thread here- thank you!). This is the first time I decided to trust the process and finish what I started. 

- Weightlifting makes me hungry. I don’t like intermittent fasting now. I like food and I can eat more. :) 

- It also makes me sleepier and thirstier, so I’ve been sleeping better and drinking more water.

- Deadlifts require good core strength, and that’s something I’m still working on. 

- I can lift heavier things in my daily life, and it has come in handy several times. 

- It’s nice to not care about the number on the scale. My weight pretty much stayed the same, but my clothes fit better. 

- Running/walking are easier. My back hurts less, and my injured shoulder is getting stronger and less sore. 

- This may be superficial, but I like the look of my muscles. 

- Weightlifting did not make me big and bulky. I did swell up around week 3, but instead of giving up like I usually do, I kept going and it got better. 

- My moods are much improved. 

Moving forward with my first 4 day upper/lower split program. Thank you r/xxfitness for pointing me in this direction.

Edited to add my routine…

I did a full body 8 week muscleandstrength.com dumbbell program (linked below). The program recommends three days a week with 24-48 hours of rest between days. A couple weeks I had more rest because my back had gotten sore. 

On my off days I did the none 2 run couch to 5K program. You’re supposed to run three days a week, but I spread it out to two days per week so I could add in a rest day or two. 

The only dietary changes I’ve made are to add in more protein (mostly with Gold Standard Whey Powder following lifts) and to increase my water intake. I also stopped intermittent fasting because my appetite increased. 

My upper body dumbbells sets started with 5-10 lbs depending on the exercise. I increased to 8-20 lbs by the end. 

My lower body work started with 10-30 lbs. by the end, I was working 12-50 lbs. I would like to go heavier, but I have to be cautious with my lower back and probably still have some form issues.

Neutral,"Request for exercises for more flexible hips/thighs.  Hi all! A bit of background here, I’ve basically been sedentary for the past decade but before that I did a variety of strike-based martial arts for another decade before that.
For a few weeks I’ve recently started to work out using a rowing machine and doing the stretches I learned from martial arts.

My main question is, are there any other exercises I should be doing to make myself more powerful/have more stamina in the hip/thigh area? I’m not trying to be crass, but I’m looking to improve my stamina/performance in the bedroom while in a dominant position. I’ve historically been in a more prone position so I’m not sure what words to even use in a search engine to look for exercises for this.

I’ve been looking into integrating more core exercises now that I’m starting to get back into the groove of things, but was wondering if there would be anything else I’m missing that’s not strictly core-related or covered by using a rowing machine.

I have a huge drop in physical energy and lose mental focus, which means I end up struggling through the last 20 mins.

I'm a 42F, 5'5, 127 lbs and have been working out consistently for about 5 years.  I eat mostly home-cooked whole foods and get about 7 hrs of sleep a night.  I know 8 is better, but...kids.  Caffeine and pre-workout are not ideal for me because of GI issues.  But if y'all can think of any strategies or tweaks I can make to try to maintain more consistent energy during my workouts, I'd appreciate it!

Usual routine:

6am: breakfast (toast with full fat cottage cheese)

7:30am: 1 hr run/walk intervals

9am: protein shake with fruit and kefir

12pm: lunch (small balanced meal, something like a chipotle-style taco bowl)

1pm: alternates between weightlifting (full body, heavy) and power yoga

Neutral,"Exercise advice after moving to a big city  Hi! Basically I have just moved to NYC from a fairly small town and I’m having trouble adapting my fitness efforts to this new environment. 

At my old town, I was just starting to get into regular exercise over the past few months after a few years on relative inactivity. I had access to an elliptical and numerous outdoor hiking locations, and I was also working on the 100 push-up program (not that far in but I had a good regular schedule going) and yoga. It helped that was I unemployed so I had a lot of free time haha. I also used to do running outside as well - I would just jog on the grass next to the sidewalk (which obviously isn’t an option since my move).

Since getting to NYC, I’ve had trouble finding good options for cardio - I don’t have an elliptical here and all the gyms (and yoga studios etc) are at least a subway ride from my apartment. I’m also working from home so on the occasional days in the office I’m getting like 12k steps just from the commute… but otherwise I’m barely even walking outside except when I’m meeting up with people on the weekends (and my neighborhood, while affordable, is not very scenic and the air is somewhat polluted so I don’t know how fun a daily stroll would be). 

I’m looking for any tips to getting into a good fitness routine in this type of urban environment. I might be able to buy an elliptical - do you think that’s worth it (and if so, any recs)? Should I just bite the bullet and accept that if I join a gym it will take at least 20 min to get there? I can do push-ups/etc and yoga at my apartment but I’ve just fallen out of a routine since I’ve gotten here since I am missing the cardio piece - not great, I know, but I really need a regular schedule to motivate myself.

We've already placed it in the [At Home/Limited Equipment Workout Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/wiki/coronavirus). The full article is linked below, along with the TL;DR from the Stronger By Science email this article was sent out in this morning.

#[""A Guide To Detraining: What To Expect, How To Mitigate Losses, And How To Get Back To Full Strength"" - Stronger By Science](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/detraining/)

##If you want to take time off of training (or you’re forced to take time off of training) what should you expect?

* How long does it take to lose muscle and strength? 

* How long will it take to regain muscle and strength once you return to training? 

* What can you do to mitigate your losses?

Here are some of the key points:

##What happens when you stop training?
Younger adults can probably “get away with” about a month of training cessation before losing too much strength and muscle mass.

Older adults (above age 60 or so) may be able to get away with about **two weeks** of training cessation. After that, losses accelerate.

Strength endurance seems to fade a bit faster.

##Mitigating the negative effects of training cessation
**If you can, do some bodyweight training.**

* 30-45 minutes of bodyweight training per week can really put the brakes on muscle and strength losses when you’re away from the gym.
Something as simple as 2-3 sets of push-ups, pull-ups, split squats, and back raises or hip thrusts once or twice per week should be sufficient to maintain the vast majority of your muscle and strength for a long, long time.

* **If you can’t (or don’t want to) do any bodyweight training**, then my primary recommendation would be to simply maintain a protein intake of approximately 1.3-1.4g of protein per kg of lean mass, and to avoid large caloric deficits or surpluses.

##The role of muscle memory
After you take some time away from training, you’ll probably find that you can regain most (or all) of the muscle and strength you’d lost in a pretty short period of time.

Due to the phenomenon of “muscle memory,” the retraining period (the amount of time it takes to regain lost muscle and strength) following a period of training cessation seems to be about half as long as the period of training cessation.

So, if you’re out of the gym for 12 weeks, you should be able to regain the vast majority of your lost strength and muscle mass in approximately 6 weeks.

##Returning to training
* **If your period of training cessation was less than a month long**, just treat it like it was an extended deload. Easing back into training shouldn’t need to be a big, multi-week process.

* **If your period of training cessation was more than a year long**, I’d probably recommend treating yourself like an untrained lifter, and embarking on any training program employing a standard linear progression.

##If your period of training cessation was between 1 and 12 months, here are my recommendations:

* **For your first week back under the bar,** include all of the exercises you plan to perform in your “normal” training, with the same set and rep volume you intend to use. However, use very light weights.

* **For your second week of training**, your aim should be to feel out weights that are challenging but not hard for all of your exercises.
From there, you should be able to sketch out a rough plan for regaining the rest of your lost strength and muscle mass, following this process:

1. Add up the number of weeks you spent away from the gym. Divide by two. That’s roughly how long it should take to return to your prior levels of performance.

2. Treating the week of training you just completed as week 1 (i.e., ignore the introductory week that involved training with ⅓ of your prior training weights), subtract your pre-training cessation training weights from your week 1 post-training cessation training weights.

3. Divide your current strength deficit by the number of weeks it should take to regain your lost strength, minus 1. That will tell you how much your training weights should increase week-by-week.

4. Repeat for all of your lifts. That should provide you with a rough blueprint for returning to training.

Currently in a calorie deficit to lose some pounds to lower risk of health problems from when I get pregnant. That out of the way, I’m curious what ppl do strengthen their muscles and stay fit before and while pregnant. 

A few things about me: 
- traditional lifting is a no go. I’ve injured my self too many times so that lifting, although I love it, tends to injure me. Yes I’ve gone to pt. I have a messed up ankle from a sprain years ago so there’s something wrong w my right side…which makes lifting heavy dangerous. (Aka all in my right side: hip pain, back pain, knee pain, shoulder pain..). The best solution I’ve found so far to any of the mentioned pains is to stay active and to stay away from lifting heavy. 
- for cardio, I mostly walk, hike around a hill I live on, or stay busy around the house, like cleaning or projects like painting, organizing etc 


I’m 31. I don’t want to kill myself anymore with crazy workouts. So that being said, what are ways you suggest to maintain or build some muscle specifically for pregnancy? (I don’t want any crazy pelvic issues…) I’m not interested in aesthetics as fat loss is all diet and staying reasonably active. I’m mostly concerned about staying healthy, specifically for having a safe pregnancy. 

Oh I’m 5’8, 156 lb, and a graduate student, so lots of sitting too. My goal is to get down to 145 before actually getting pregnant. For those curious, im eating around 1300-1600 calories depending on activity level w a few maintenance days or indulgence days sprinkled in."

. Jump rope + various gadgets to do abs and plank that honestly I have never used.

. An elliptical machine (don't ask)

Neutral,"How to Test Your One-Rep Max (1RM)  How do you test your one-rep max (1RM)? Should you test your bench press, squat and deadlift 1-rep maxes all in one session? And do you actually need to know your 1RM?

In this post, I’ll answer all of those questions. (TLDR at the end of the post)

But before we start, let’s first have a look at what the 1RM actually is.

# What is a one-rep max (1RM)?

Your one-rep max is the maximum amount of weight you can lift on any exercise for exactly one rep. And it is different from a single, which is a heavy set where you only do 1 rep, in that it uses all of your physical and mental energy to lift said weight exactly one time. So it’s impossible to do a second or even a third rep.

Basically, the 1RM is a measure for your maximum strength on any exercise.

# Why knowing your 1RM is useful

And this leads me to why knowing your 1RM is useful.

Because your 1RM is a proxy for your strength, you can use it to track your progress. If your 1RM increases over time, it means you are gaining strength and your training is on point. In contrast, when you’re 1RM is going down or sits at the same number for many months, you might have to adjust your training, nutrition or recovery to see further progress.

Another reason why it’s useful to know your 1RM is because you need to have at least a rough idea of how strong you are in order to train effectively.

For example, many training programmes prescribe a certain weight for an exercise based on your 1RM. And if your programme says you should lift 70% of your 1RM, then it’s helpful to know your 1RM for that exercise. Otherwise you have no idea what weight you should pick.

But even if your training is purely based on RPE (rate of perceived exertion) or RIR (reps in reserve), having a rough understanding of your 1RM is necessary. Because knowing your 1RM lets you pick an appropriate weight for the given number of reps & sets to hit the desired RPE or RIR.

And while you can technically test your 1RM for any given exercise, most people - including me - only test their 1RM for big compound lifts, such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses and overhead presses.

# How to test & calculate your 1RM

But before I explain how you can test your 1RM, I want to emphasise that you should only do a 1RM testing session if you feel fit & healthy, are well-rested, and have no injuries and no pain. Because if you aren’t healthy, you increase your injury risk and are not accurately testing your 1RM anyway.

**Step 1: General warmup**

The first thing you should do before testing your 1RM is a proper warmup. As a general warmup, I recommend 5-10min of light cardio, followed by some dynamic warmup drills.

For the cardio, just pick anything you like. That can be walking on the treadmill or doing jumping jacks. As long as you get your heart rate and core temperature elevated, it doesnt matter what type of cardio you do. 

The next step is some dynamic stretching. The exact exercises will vary depending on what lift you are testing. The goal is to go through the motions, warmup your joints and tendons, and activate all the necessary muscles. 

**Step 2: Specific warmup**

So now it’s time for even more warmup, but this time it’s getting very specific. Basically, you should do 4-5 warmup sets of the exercise you want to test later on. This will help you get ready for your heavy lifting both physically & mentally, and you can practice your technique once more.

As an example, you could do the following warm-up sets: 

* 10 reps with the empty bar
* 5 reps with 40% 1RM
* 2 reps with 60% 1RM
* 1 rep with 80% 1RM

And another quick tip: Rest as long as you need between your warmup sets and before your testing set. Because you want to feel ready after your warmup sets, not exhausted exhausted ;) 

**Step 3: Testing your 1RM**

But now you’re ready to test your 1RM. There are actually two different ways to test your 1RM - one is suited for bodybuilders and all recreational athletes, and the other is suited for competitive powerlifters and weightlifters. Here, I’ll only talk about the bodybuilding-style 1RM test, because it is the better option for most people.

To do a bodybuilding-style 1RM test, load 90% of your previous 1RM onto the bar. And if you never tested your 1RM before, don’t worry! Simply use a weight that you think you can do 3-5 reps with. And once you have the weight on the bar, do as many reps as possible with good technique (AMRAP). Ideally, you should aim for 3+ reps. And for your own safety, always use a spotter and/or the safety pins of the squat rack when attempting max lifts!

**Step 4: Calculating your 1RM**

So, we’re almost done now. The only thing left to do is to calculate your 1RM, and it’s actually pretty streightforwards. To calculate your 1RM yourself, multiply the weight you lifted times the number of reps times 0.033. Then add back the weight that you lifted, and voila, you found your new 1RM!

Alternatively, there are many [online calculators](https://www.nasm.org/resources/one-rep-max-calculator) where you can simply plug in the weight and number of reps, and it’ll do the calculation for you.

Regardless of whether you calculate it yourself or use an online calculator, the 1RM value that you get won’t be 100% accurate. However, if you are in the low-rep range, meaning if you've got less than 5-6 reps, the estimate should be fairly accurate. And I think for most people, testing your 1RM this way is the safer alternative to literally maxing out.

# Example 1RM testing & workout schedule

And by the way, this 1RM testing method doesn’t just work for the squats, but you can apply it to any other exercise.

However, when you want to test the 1-rep maxes of multiple exercises, I recommend doing so in several workout sessions with at least one rest day in-between. And there are actually two reasons for this:

First, 1RM testing is very taxing on your body. So by the time you tested your first 1RM, let’s say the squats, you will be fatigued. So when you go on to testing your bench press 1RM, you’re most likely not measuring your true 1RM because you’re already exhausted. And it gets even worse when you go on to the third exercise, in this case the deadlift.

And second, because you’re getting fatigued after 1RM testing, you increase your risk for technique breakdown and injury.

That’s why I prefer to dedicate a whole week to testing the one-rep maxes on the big three lifts. For example, you could test your squat 1RM on Monday, your bench press 1RM on Wednesday, and your deadlift 1RM on Friday. That way, you have one rest day between every 1RM test day, which gets rid of the two problems I mentioned before.

And if you don’t want to go to the gym just for the 1RM testing, you can always add a short workout to the 1RM test of that day. For example, after testing your squat 1RM, you could do leg curls, hip abductions & calf raises. (I prefer doing machine exercises after 1RM testing, because I'm usually heavily fatigued, and the injury risk is normally lower with machines than with free weights.)

# How often should you test your 1RM?

But now that you know everything about how to test your 1RM, how often should you actually test it?

Generally speaking, I would test your 1RM anything between once and 4-times per year, so every 3, 6, or 12 months. Because testing your 1RM more frequently can actually have some downsides:

First, your strength needs several weeks if not months of training to increase. So there’s no point in testing it every other week, because your strength won’t have increased noticably in such a short time frame.

And second, testing your 1RM on any exercise is very taxing for your body. So if you overdo it, you might run into recovery issues down the line. That’s why I would have at least three months in-between 1RM tests.

And that’s everything you need to know about how to test your 1RM! Hope you found it useful :)

# TLDR

* Your one-rep max is the maximum amount of weight you can lift on any exercise for exactly one rep.
* Knowing your 1RM is useful to track your progress, to train effectively & to have an understanding of your strength. 
* Most people only test their 1RM for big compound lifts, i.e. squats, deadlifts, bench press and overhead press. Leave at least one rest day between testing the 1RM for different lifts.
* How to test your 1RM: 
   * Step 1: General Warm-up (light cardio & dynamic stretching)
   * Step 2: Specific Warm-Up (do 4-5 warm-up sets)
   * Step 3: Test your 1RM by doing 1 AMRAP set with 90% of your previous 1RM
   * Step 4: Calculate your new 1RM with an online calculator
* Only do a 1RM testing session if you feel fit & healthy, are well-rested, and have no injuries and no pain.
* Always use a spotter and/or the safety pins if attempting max lifts!"

Disordered,"4 years of progress. 15kg goes a long way!  Photos: https://imgur.com/a/8WMFCAX

Hi xxfitness,


I've been a long time lurker in this sub but thought my progress might be interesting to share. Despite playing sport and being active my whole child/teenhood, I started hitting the gym in 2016. I made very small amounts of progress because my chronic illness was brewing in the background before it severely hit me, ruined my life and erased any muscle I ever gained in 2017. I was 20 at the time.


Things became more manageable over time and I returned to the gym in mid 2018. As time ticked away I became more able to manage my health and my diet, allowing me to eat in a caloric surplus and consistently hit the gym... Hard.


That brings us to now. I'm 25, currently lifting about 4 days a week, and playing tennis on the off days. I went from 44kg to 59kg in 4 years, and I have never looked or athletically performed better in my life. I am a science nerd and write my own programs based on current literature, so I'm running a modified push/pull/legs split where I alternate between push+legs and pull+legs. I have just come off a bout of full body every day training and have changed it up, but frequency is king. I base all my workouts around the main compound lifts and fill with accessory movements. Train like a man is all I can really say. Many of the programs written for women are shit in that sense- treating it like it should be different for us. It isn't!


While I have tracked calories in the past, I'm at the point now where I know how much I'm eating and when I've eaten too little. I believe anyone wanting to gain weight should diligently track food for at least a couple months when starting out, as it's hard to know how little you're actually consuming without some frame of reference.


I hope this brings some inspiration or motivation because weight gain can be done. We are surrounded by stories of weight loss, but gaining it is extremely difficult and takes the same level of dedication and discipline. Looking at the photos taken 5 years ago compared to now completely blows my mind. I can't believe I did it.


Thanks for reading my TED talk!!


Edit: forgot to mention that I follow the 5/3/1 program for squat, deadlift, bench and OHP. Regarding the discussion below about training like a bloke, using a concept like 5/3/1 compares you to you, allowing progression based on your current strength, rather than a blanket progression to follow.

Edit 2: I'm 163cm/5'4. My body fat % tends to hover around the 20-22% mark. 100% natty. I am genuinely flattered I have had DMs asking if I'm not."

Neutral,"Replacing Yoga/walks with Weights  Good morning!

Recently, life has gotten a LOT busier, which has me doing a mental audit of my fitness, which time-wise is quite demanding at 1.5 hours a day.

My question: would a simple weighted routine (squats, pull ups, push ups, bicep curls, shoulder press, etc.) for 30mins/day be enough to ""replace"" yoga and walking? I've loved this season of slower fitness, but feel as though I'm spinning my wheels now, and could get a lot more bang-fot-my-time-buck by knocking out some quality weighted reps.

Neutral,"Maintaining strength while transitioning from lifting, manual labor, and high elevation hiking into long-distance cycling.  I’ve been losing weight for around one year now and would like to shed 10-15 more pounds. After that, I was ideally going to bulk before my Summer 2023 season. My job makes it hard to keep weight on as I would need to eat a lot. I’ve been lifting often since April and haven’t stopped adding weight to my lifts since so I’m really happy with my gains.

I decided recently to take the winter for bikepacking and long-distance cycle in the southern hemisphere so now I’m gearing up for another season of making it hard to keep on weight. It should help me solidify my cut but I’m also curious if anyone has any tips to compensate for not being able to lift or do a lot of resistance training for 2-3 months in lieu of cardio. I will be international and rural mostly, putting in long days. I believe the strength I have going into it will be a benefit to me, but I’m wondering just how much I’ll lose even if I keep a high-protein diet and try to maintain weight.

Being the multi-sport guru I aspire to isn’t in my mastery yet so any personal anecdotes or advice is appreciated!"

Disordered,"my journey to fixing my back squat and finally squatting a plate 🍽  wanted to do a lil write-up of how i dealt with my back squat struggles and what i learned along the way. consider this post the follow up to this one - [why is my back squat stuck AF](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/t49f0h/why_is_my_back_squat_stuck_af/)?

background: i started lifting a little over a year ago and running stronger by the day exactly a year ago. like everyone, i saw lots of quick gains and \[i thought\] i hit a 125 lb squat in october.

however, over the next couple months my squat progress stalled and even regressed; that led me to post to yall. based on your feedback, i deloaded and work on my form and then built myself back up. i hit some snags along the way (TW: two pregnancies and two early miscarriages which were both physically and mentally draining. i lifted through them but only for maintenance.) but finally after a few months, i started seeing real improvements and today i hit my goal ive had for a year - [i squatted a plate](https://imgur.com/a/8axeTEB)! (at BW 115lb, with what i think is decent form and juuust at parallel.)

here's what i learned that could be helpful esp for newish lifters:

\- **be honest with yourself about depth**: while ass-to-grass depth isnt necessary to progress, if youre doing ego reps you are cheating yourself. when i look back at my 125 lb squat from last october, i was several inches above parallel; this made me feel like my progress was faster than it actually was.

\- **don't hesitate to de-load and work on form**: again, looking back at old videos, it's clear i didn't have a solid form foundation it build from. i should've de-loaded then, rather than letting those bad habits solidify.

\- **ask for feedback, but don't get overwhelmed**: it can be hard as a new lifter to ask for feedback on reddit and get a million different responses. consider a more targeted approach (e.g. paying a remote trainer just for form feedback), or if you do get feedback from a big group, pay attention to a) feedback from the most experienced lifters in the community and b) common themes that emerge across all the comments.

\- **anatomy matters but it isn't destiny:** i have an extremely short torso and long femurs. when i learned this is disadvantageous for squatting, it helped me feel less frustrated at why it progressed slower than my other lifts. but i didnt let that discourage me from improving it.

\- **don't be afraid of equipment**: so many people told me that squat shoes would help my form, esp. given my anatomy, but i viewed it as... cheating somehow? it's obviously not. equipment won't fix everything but it can help you unlock your full potential.

\- **experiment with your nutrition**: i generally ate 1g/protein per 1lb bw and thought that was enough. but once i upped my calories slightly (\~200 more per day) and aimed for 40% protein, my progress picked up significantly.

\- **trust the process**: everyone tells you that lifting progress comes in fits and starts, but it's hard to believe that when you're in your first long plateau. but... it's true!

i think that's all. thanks everyone for the feedback along the way - i think ive still got some juice to squeeze from my current squat progress but im gonna keep working on getting that 135 rep below parallel ;)"

I’m interested in y’all’s opinions about the accuracy of these charts. Does resting heart rate have anything to do with max heart rate? It seems like overall fitness would also be a factor. 

I’m a lifter who decided to add some running, and I think I want most of my runs to be “zone 2” which, according to descriptions of perceived exertion is a pace you can sustain for a long time, be able to talk, but more effort than walking.  
It’s supposed to be 60-70% of max heart rate.

Neutral,"Am I missing something on how to push myself?  Hi everyone, I’m new to having a regular exercise routine. Previously, I’d been doing yoga and plenty of walking, but that only got me so far toward my goals. The last couple of months, I’ve been running a mile in intervals and lifting. I should note that I’m trying to lose just a few more pounds (lost about 20 before starting my more dedicated routine) while maintaining as much muscle as possible. So I’m in a slight calorie deficit and focusing on protein. 

What is really a bummer is that I don’t find my endurance improving. I feel like I’ve barely improved my running since starting, and I run (or bike or row) 3 times a week. The issue is that any time I run more than about 0.2m, I start to feel really close to collapsing. I want to push myself, feel the burn, all that, but find that I genuinely can’t without risking a fall. 

Has anyone else struggled with something similar? I’m hoping for suggestions to try before seeing a doctor about it (it’s very difficult to see a doctor where I live, takes several months)

Edit: I’d like to clarify that I don’t think my intervals are high intensity. The running portion is closer to jogging (around setting 5.4 on treadmill). With so many people suggesting my running intervals are too intense, I will try to adjust! But much slower would be difficult to maintain a run at.

Neutral,"If you were only going to weight train for 20 mins a week, what would you do?  **Question**

I want some of the bone/joint health and athleticism benefits of weight training, but truly, I'm only willing to devote 20 minutes to it a week.

My first thought was to do 3x5 squats once a week since that's a pretty full body exercise. I probably won't make much progress, but I could at least maintain the strength I have now. But am I going to become unbalanced just doing squats? Should I just pick a different lift every week and do a couple sets of that? Or is there something specific that you think would complement the other exercise I'm doing? Often my upper back hurts. Should I focus on deadlifts to target that?

**Context**

I used to do a lot of lifting a couple years ago. Now, I have more time and money, so I've been able to do exercise that's more fun to me instead. Right now, I:

* ice skate 2-4 hours a week
* rock climb for about an hour a week
* walk 5000-15000 steps a day
* practice handstands for about 15 mins a week (if you have advice on how to get better at these, I would accept that too!)

Thank you for any and all advice!  


Edit: I should have said that the rock climbing gym has a weight area, so I don't need to buy anything. I'm planning on fitting in these 20 mins before or after one of my climbing sessions. Lots of good advice so far, thank you!"
Disordered,"Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control, and Training - Strongerbyscience literature review  Because it seems to be of interest to users in the sub, I wanted to spotlight one of the first articles I ever read on [training and menstrual cycles](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/menstrual-cycle-contraceptives-complete-guide-athletes/) on Strongerbyscience that put together an overview of relevant literature. Key takeaways include: 

- Most physiological variables in performance (strength, endurance, anaerobic capacity, etc.) are mostly unaffected by the menstrual cycle.

- Performance may vary throughout the menstrual cycle, but those variations are more a function of PMS/menstrual symptoms (like motivation, concentration, and lethargy) than due to the aforementioned physiological variables. The considerable variation in how different individuals are affected by menstrual symptoms may be related to Mg/Ca balance and serotonin levels, and exercise can lessen their severity. Nutrition adjustments may also be beneficial, especially consuming more carbs.

- During the luteal phase (approx 2 weeks before your period) your body temperature MAY be slightly elevated, and you may find you need recovery time. Likewise, you may find performance easier during the follicular phase (week of your period and the one immediately after). This may be due to decreased muscle damage and faster recovery. Big disclaimer that this doesn't hold for all individuals who menstruate, and may not even hold month to month for the same person. 

- Oral contraceptives may ""smooth out"" the perceived performance difference between follicular and luteal phases. In other words, if you're on birth control your performance may be more ""even"" through your cycle. 

- More on birth control: the article has a section on oral contraceptives and how they affect training, a topic that later got its own post on SBS and was spotlighted by u/MCHammerCurls [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/ugu7fv/research_review_do_oral_contraceptives_affect/). I recommend checking out that post if you're interested!

- Women in competitive sports tend to have higher rates of ACL injuries than men. This has long been believed to be due to anatomy, but more recent research suggests that the phase of the menstrual cycle plays a role in injury risk. This gap is reduced in dancers and increased in team sports athletes, and Greg's tl;dr is 

> It may be wise to wear a knee brace during the premenstrual period, the first couple of days of menstruation, and around the time of ovulation. Additionally, learning proper landing and cutting mechanics (or enrolling in ballet classes) may decrease your risk of ACL injuries.

I'm unsure whether that last point may be relevant at all to most recreational athletes, because most of the literature about higher injury rates seems to be about professional or college athletes, but I found it pretty interesting all the same.

Note that the article was originally posted in 2015, but it seems to have held up pretty well. Most of the conclusions align with the findings in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/wkxsdq/menstrual_cycle_training_myths/) by u/bethskw, which spotlights menstrual cycles training myths, based on much more recent sources. Some common findings include the fact that the luteal period (from ovulation to menstruation) may be the ideal time to take a deload week for some individuals, and that increasing carb intake may lessen PMS or other negative feelings during that phase - again with the disclaimer that you really don't ""have"" to do any of these things if you feel fine doing something different instead.

(As an aside, the video linked in that post is by Alyssa Olenick, who has a PhD in Exercise Physiology and is an amazingly well-rounded athlete - I recommend checking our [her channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW4CCAMyceAtaGVKhpUqcfQ) for quality fitness content). 

A more recent article [co-authored by Nucklos](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2020/05000/Sex_Differences_in_Resistance_Training__A.30.aspx?context=FeaturedArticles&collectionId=1) was published in 2020 provides an in-depth literature review on the topic of sex differences impacting training. It also touches on studies that focus specifically on the impact of the menstrual cycle, and ultimately concludes that such studies are overall not very robust - some are contradictory, others are not significant in some way (due to too-small sample size, sample testing, biases in participant selection such as low initial progesterone levels not accurately verifying the actual phase of the cycle with hormonal testing, etc.), and ultimately the existing scientific literature is not very comprehensive; tl;dr:

> Although some studies suggest that hormonal differences play a role in changes, larger and well-controlled studies are needed to understand why that occurs or how it affects strength or hypertrophy adaptations.

In fact, there seem to be more articles questioning the methodology and robustness of studies on the topic than there _are_ robust studies on the topic - such as [this literature review](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/EP086797) on the scientific design ambiguity in studies comparing sexes and/or menstrual cycle phases, and [this 2021 paper](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/wspaj/29/2/article-p146.xml) on the sport sexes data gap. I'm not an expert on the topic, but as a regular nerdy layperson, existing literature seems to confirm my anecdotal intuition of ""if you want to modify your training to adjust for your period, listen to your body and find a way that works best for you"".

Neutral,"Running Questions  Apologies if these have been asked before! I’ve decided to take up running because I can’t fit another gym day in my schedule to do cardio there and I have a dog so it seems like a good fit.

1. When I started for the first time last night, straight away my shins were sore, my thigh muscles seemed sore (I have got mild DOMS though) and overall it just seemed like my legs were super unhappy. Is this normal and if so, when is it likely to stop? I’ve got decent running shoes. 

2. My build (thanks to my family) is not petite or the lean build I usually see on runners. I have bigger thighs and broad shoulders, in the UK we’d probably refer to it as a rugby build so more strength than lean. It might sound like a silly question but would that make running the wrong form of cardio? I know rugby players run but it seems more like short and intense but frequent bursts so I didn’t know if something like HIIT is a better option. Sorry if this sounds utterly stupid, I just don’t see anyone near me running with a build like mine…

3. Is the runners high actually real? I genuinely only feel misery but hoping that might change with time!

Neutral,"Back in the office. Did not realize how physically deconditioned I was. Can anyone recommend some good upper back and neck strengthening regimes?  Hi all, I hope you're safe and well. I was extremely lucky to get a new job with good people (knock on wood, hope it stays that way!) after almost 2 years of working from home doing part-time, low-paying work.

I went back to the office today and just sitting at my desk and looking at my computer for hours hurt my neck and upper back. It also gave me a headache in the back of my head, probably from muscle tension and referred pain. For the past 2 years I've worked with a laptop, not a desktop, and rested my head on my hand. Fortunately there are laptops at work that I can use in the meantime. 

I've had problems working with desktops at previous jobs; it could certainly be poor posture, but I also have really, really weak neck and upper back muscles. Stretching feels great while I do it, but it's not enough on its own. I need to go to wrestling school, LOL.

Can anyone recommend some good neck and back strengthening (not stretching - got plenty of those) programs? Also, has anyone else experienced this? We hear so much about low back problems, but not as much about upper back problems. Thanks!"

Disordered,"Using machines to strength train?  I recently went back to planet fitness after 1.5 years of crossfit to save some money on a monthly membership. The one thing I liked about crossfit was that I didn’t have to create the workouts or really do anything besides look at the WOD when I got there.

So now I’m at planet fitness. My main concern is loosing all the strength and muscle I’ve gained so far.. so I’m curious.. do ya’ll think doing the machine circuits would be sufficient to gain/maintain muscle at planet fitness. For example, for an arms day id do every arm machine for 5 sets of heavy 5 reps - or something to that effect. I’m keeping reps low and weight heavy on all the machines.

Is this a good approach or do I really need to follow some sort of programming? It seems like rotating through all the machines hits all the muscles. I’m currently doing two leg days, two arms/back days, and then maybe a bonus cardio day of some sort.

I was always told not to use a lifting belt because my ex-partner was my old training partner as well and he always said something about how it makes you more wide, which doesn't really makes sense to me.

I’m good with strength training and cardio, but I want to learn how to bench press. I’m a little nervous though, despite one of my gym buddies agreeing to help me with my form and everything. I think it’s mainly because the gym I’m in is mostly compromised of men and it would be strange to see a girl doing this (I know it’s wrong to think) and the simple fact that I’m scared I’ll do something wrong and hurt myself. Anyone went through this before when learning a new exercise? Any tips on how to overcome this?"
Neutral,"I’m already doing too much, so how do I shoehorn cycling into my training schedule?  I work 40-50 hours/week, and virtually all of my free time around work is spent training. Until yesterday, I was “only” training for a half marathon, rock climbing goals, and being ready for ski season. Yesterday, I added a 50 mile bike race to that pile. Without getting into too much detail, it’s important to me to be able to participate in the bike race (without getting injured or put out of commission for weeks), but not important how long it takes me to finish.

Upcoming milestones:

* 7 weeks: Half marathon race (B goal, was going to go for sub-2 but now I just want to finish as strong as I can)
* 9 weeks: 50 mile bike race (C goal, not yet incorporated into training plan)
* 10 weeks: Rock climbing trip (A goal, want to be climbing 5.12’s by this time, I’m already sending 5.11d’s so I’m not far off)
* 12+ weeks: Backcountry skiing (the main reason I’m doing weightlifting)

Here’s my current training schedule, not accounting for the bike race:

|Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|Saturday|Sunday|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0.5hr easy run|0.5hr tempo run||0.5hr easy run||1-2hr long run||
|0.5hr weight-lifting|1.5hr core/ shoulder circuit|0.5hr weight-lifting|||||
|1-2hr rock climbing (power/ strength)||2-3hr rock climbing (technique & endurance)|1.5-2.5hr rock climbing (fun/ whatever I feel like climbing)||||

""Weightlifting"" is a full-body circuit excluding lifts that have significant overlap with rock climbing (e.g. no pull-ups, rows, etc.). Fridays and Sundays are reserved for other activities, travel, and/or inevitable push-back of the weekday workout schedule.

I do generally try to do all of those activities during the week, except for the optional Thursday rock climbing, but I shift them around the week as needed to make them all happen depending on how I’m feeling and my schedule.

 If you’ve read this far, thanks! And my question is: How would you fit bike training into this schedule? My current idea is to replace the Thursday run with a bike commute, and add in a long ride on Sundays, but I’m concerned about overtraining – I already feel close to the edge with the current plan. Would eliminating leg workouts from the second weightlifting day help maybe? Open to any ideas you have and/or reassurances that I’ve lost my marbles."
Disordered,"DEXA scans and other inaccuracies  Really good article from u/gnuckols today on body composition ""measurements,"" including DEXA. This is a subject that comes up here from time to time, so...

Here's the article: [https://macrofactorapp.com/body-composition/](https://macrofactorapp.com/body-composition/)

Some relevant quotes: 

>The first thing to know is that there’s no way of *measuring* body composition in living, breathing humans. There is exactly one way to *measure* body composition: carefully dissecting a cadaver, and weighing each component of the cadaver after completing the dissection. That’s certainly a morbid fact to ponder, but it’s the bedrock of body composition assessment.  
>  
>If you’ve never been dissected – since you’re reading this article, I assume you haven’t – you’ve never had your body composition *measured*. You’ve only had your body composition *estimated*. Understanding this fact is important for two reasons. First, it invites a simple question: “what IS actually being measured in order to estimate body composition?” Second, it invites us to consider the validity and reliability of body composition estimates.

I was already familiar with the pitfalls of BIA scales (and other devices that use conductive pads on your hands or feet to estimate body fat %) but I never got a DEXA scan or even gave DEXA much thought, so I only had a vague sense that there is some inaccuracy but wasn't sure where it might come from. This was eye opening (emphasis mine): 

>Due to the relatively expensive and high-tech nature of these scanners, people often assume that their body composition estimates are nearly perfect. However, there are some noteworthy limitations that are rarely acknowledged outside of academic journals. For example, DEXA scanners are unable to directly measure tissue thickness, so **they are forced to derive composition estimates of a 3-dimensional body from a 2-dimensional scan**. Further, the devices are only able to estimate soft tissue composition (i.e., the relative content of lean tissue and fat tissue) in pixels that contain no bone mass. For most scans, about 40% of the total pixels will contain bone, so **nearly half of the scan is essentially uninterpretable** (without assumption-driven calculations) for the purpose of body fat estimation.

We often assume that even if a method is a little bit off, it will still be consistent enough to help us measure changes over time. That's not always true, though. When it comes to BIA scales, I noticed that my scale never changes its estimate very much even when I've made significant changes to my body composition. Research bears this out; scales aren't very useful this way. 

Here's how that may shake out with DEXA (this quote comes after a detailed example, worth clicking through and reading the whole thing): 

>If DEXA says you lost 14kg of fat and 6kg of lean mass, that actually means you lost somewhere between 10-18kg of fat, and somewhere between 2-10kg of lean mass. In other words, DEXA is telling you that the outcome of your diet was somewhere between “unambiguously good” and “catastrophically bad.”

This doesn't mean scans are useless, but we should probably be taking them with a huge grain of salt - which may make some of us reconsider whether we want or need one."

Disordered,"Functional fitness vs weight lifting with long recovery  Relatively new and trying to get some clarity on this from people who know more than I do. To encourage building strength, lifting programs will involve compound lifts/some isolation exercises and then 1.5-3 minutes of recovery in between sets. This is what I do when I go to the gym on my own.

When I work out with a PT, I'm doing 3 sets of 3 exercises right after each-other, with a break when I've finished 1 set of each exercise. This seems more like functional fitness to me **(is that right?)** \- some of these exercises are compound lifts (on the lighter side), or box jumps (so it mixes it up).

Different styles of training probably have different objectives. Lifting as I do is purely for hypertrophy and strength, and then functional fitness is good for mobility and fat loss - is that right?

I'm almost on my last session of megsquats' before the barbell (which I found on this sub, 11/10 program) and I'm looking for what to do next. I've been drawn to gzcl but I'm a little apprehensive about the rep scheme (ie 5x3, if you fail that then 6x2, etc). my two reservations are

* my apartment gym is usually empty, and if I'm working at a weight where 3 reps should feel challenging then I'd definitely want someone available to spot 
* I'm not tryna go into powerlifting and lift as heavy as possible, just want to build strength-- so the ""lift 3x and then take a massive rest break, then repeat"" just sounds super boring to me, I'd rather work at a weight where I can squeeze out 6-8ish reps  

so with that said, what would go wrong if I change the progression, like make it 3x6 -> 4x4 -> 6x3 or something? if I'm ruining the program, what similar ones should I look into? I like being able to customize the accessory exercises and want to do 3 full-body sessions a week, around 4 (5 max) exercises each session if possible. please don't suggest stronger by the day; I'm in the discord for it and the community is lovely, it just looks a bit too heavy for my schedule (also meg is amazing but ideally I'd like to follow a free program lol).

So  basically I am just trying to come up how to arrange all those  activities during a week in the way that is most reasonable, productive  and beneficial. Can anyone offer some advice on that?

EDIT: Can someone explain why is my every comment downvoted? I am total newbie both to fitness and those communities. I am just trying to get my life together lately."

Neutral,"Need Advice  So I’ve been going to the gym for at least 2 years now. Since April/May I have started a new 5 day split and recently for the past few weeks I have been struggling to increase my weights or make progress on my lifts. 

Stats are as follows;
- 23yrs old
- Weigh roughly 72kg
- 169cm height 
- Eating 2600 cals - lean bulk 
- Just trying to get a nice physique 
- Been going gym for 2 years roughly before this 5 day split. Did a 4 day split 

The split consists of one compound per day which is progressively overloaded with weight each week. Then you have isolations as well. The compound have top sets and then back off sets. The days go by upper, lower, pull, push and legs. Not gonna write out the whole split as it’s too long but I will show what I do for upper:

Bench
Wk 1: TS of 8 followed by 2x10-12
Wk 2: TS of 5 followed by 3x6-8
Wk 3: TS of 3 followed by 3x4-6
Shoulder press 3x8-10
DB row 3x10-12
Incline Hammer strength Machine 3x10-12 
Cable row 2x12-15 
Standing lat raise machine 2x12-15

So what I have done so far to try and improve my progress:
I’m currently on a lean bulk and I am making weight gain and I sleep for a minimum of 7 hrs.
I take vitamins, magnesium and vitamin D.
I have tried BCAAs mixed with my pre and now currently trying electrolytes.

Always getting out of breath and getting tired easily not sure why. I make sure I have enough calories before gym. I have noticed that my body is taking a few days to recover from the workouts which is affecting other days in the gym. For instant I do sumo deadlifts on legs which is on a Monday and then I’m still sore for lower which is on Thursday and I do squats that day.

Can’t find any help in the FAQs. Just wanted some advice on what other people have done to help them if they have been in a similar Situation?"

Neutral,"Program Review: Nuckols 3x Bench Int Med/Coan-Phillipi Deadlift/Dark Horse Squat  This is rather long but hopefully parts of it are useful

**TL;DR** Combined some established programs and got my lifts up pretty quickly without being very diligent about nutrition/recovery

**About me:** 19F, 5’3”, 120-130 lbs. Very little athletic background other than playing rec soccer as a kid and doing dumb internet home workouts. When covid hit I started taking strength training more seriously but couldn’t go to the gym so did a program consisting mainly of weighted push-ups and pull-ups. I started lifting following the r/Fitness basic beginner program in summer 2021, then did GZCLP and some mix of the 28 free programs for a few months. The best progress I had before this was running SBS RTF for about 14 weeks last winter.

**Goals:** I program hopped a bit after RTF and couldn’t really settle onto one program. I saw the Coan-Phillipi program while looking through LiftVault and decided I really wanted to get my deadlift up past 200. I also wanted to get my bench closer to 1 plate. This program was my solution for that. 

**Results:** I’m still not very strong but my lifts did go up quite a bit. Bench is touch and go; deadlift is with straps. 

|Lift|Initial|Current|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Bench press|110|130, also got 110x9|
|Squat|115?|155|
|Deadlift|170|205|

**The Program**

This was nominally a 12 week, 5x/week program inspired heavily by u/BenchPauper’s [Megazord](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/alrvuw/program_review_megazord_hybrid_program/). The second and fifth days were deadlift and squat days, respectively, while the rest were bench days. I didn’t tie workouts to specific days of the week but just completed them whenever I could get to the gym and took rest days whenever I couldn’t. Towards the end this meant I often worked out more than 5x a week, and I got the program done in under 12 weeks.

The deadlift days followed the Coan-Phillipi deadlift progression, with a goal weight of 200 lbs, and with Romanian deadlifts instead of stiff leg DLs. They typically consisted of a heavy topset followed by lighter speed work and a bunch of accessory work. The squat days were taken from Megazord, which was inspired by Brian Alsruhe’s Dark Horse, and consisted of working up to rep max on a squat variation, completing an AMRAP and some backoff sets, and then doing a 10 minute EMOM of light squats. The bench days were taken from Greg Nuckols’ 28 free programs 3x int med volume. On the third bench day, I also did some other pressing variation, following the 28 free programs bench 1x int program. This was incline press for the first 4-week cycle and push press for the remainder.

Apart from the Coan-Phillipi prescribed assistance on deadlift days, assistance was mostly pulling work on bench days and sometimes abs on squat days. Did abs a bit more often towards the end because my gf wanted to. Most of the time I didn’t do a ton of accessories; after a day in the lab I really just wanted to get the work done and get out. 

**Diet**

I put very little thought into this, basically ate whatever and just tried to get enough protein. I didn’t have access to a kitchen for most of this program which made it worse. For the first half of the program I basically tried to stuff myself as much as possible, ate a bunch of junk, and put on probably about 10 lbs. For the second half I prepped my lunches out of rotisserie chicken, steam in bag vegetables, and either rice or ramen noodles and tried to eat better overall. Ended up losing about 5 lbs over the last six weeks. 

**What went well**

* I love high frequency heavy benching. Bench is my favorite lift and doing it a ton was awesome. Got a lot of practice with hitting heavy weights smoothly and consistently. 
* I got a lot of practice pulling heavy. I hadn’t really touched heavy weights for a while so this was really good for getting dialed in.
* Squats feel smooth and painless now. Squats are my worst lift and have always felt uncomfortable and often given me lower back discomfort. I’m still bad at squatting but at least it feels like I can actually squat. 

**What I would've done differently**

* I really didn’t do enough conditioning. I thought bike commuting would be enough; it wasn’t. 
* I should’ve pushed squats harder. Think I lowballed the rep maxes which decreased the prescribed weights, and I was definitely sandbagging the AMRAPs. I should’ve pushed them much harder. 

**Thoughts/lessons learned**

* Despite my mental weakness on squats, squat days were hard. I’ve never felt worse lifting than on the 10 rep backoff sets on the last day of front squats. 
* I pushed the bench AMRAPS HARD. I often hit true failure and had to do the roll of shame on those sets. I now have a better feeling of failure on bench.
* I failed a deadlift set (at 180) somewhere other than off the floor for the first time on week 4 of the program. Got it up to around my shins and just couldn’t lock out. 
* Around the time I failed the deadlift, my bench training max was stuck at 130 for weeks. I seriously considered ditching the program and trying something else. Given the progress I had in the end, this was a good lesson in being patient and trusting the program.
* My bench TM was stagnant for 2-3 weeks at a time after the first few weeks. This was fine; my bench wasn’t realistically going to go up by 55 lbs in 12 weeks, since that would amount to a 50% increase. Think as a smaller woman this is to be expected, but it definitely worried me at the time. 
* I really just needed to be more patient on deadlifts. Taking a bit more time at the floor was instrumental in increasing my deadlift. 
* The weight is supposed to feel heavy. Just because it feels heavy doesn’t mean I can’t do it, and how heavy it feels isn’t a good indication of RIR. 
* Going to the gym whenever I could instead of sticking to a strict schedule was very effective. It allowed me to find consistency, and I’ve found that whenever I’m consistent for a few months my lifts increase.  
* “Optimal” conditions aren’t necessary for me to progress. I was biking 4-8 miles a day, sleeping 6-8 hours (I feel best on 9 hours of sleep), and I was usually famished by the time I hit the gym. None of that stopped me from progressing and hitting the weights I needed to. In the past I’ve had my best progress on vacations from school/work where I’m just relaxing all day, sleeping a lot, eating a ton, etc., so this was a nice way of proving to myself that I can progress quickly while having other life commitments. 
* As long as I’m not actively trying to stuff myself, I’m probably going to lose weight. For the second half of the program, I wasn’t trying to lose weight, just eat a bit healthier, but ended up losing almost a pound a week.

**Conclusion/what’s next**

This program did its job and got all of my lifts up at a rate that was the fastest since I was doing linear progression. I’m now running Deep Water for the mental gains and to do some more high rep work after so much high intensity stuff."
Neutral,"No barbells at Planet Fitness  Hey everyone, I'm a complete noobie at the gym so I apologize for the dumb question. I'm interested in either doing GZCLP or the Thinner Leaner Stronger program, but both require your usual compound lifts with the barbell (squat, deadlift, bench press).

I've had a membership at PF since around February, but they only have Smith machines. I was wondering if I could still do those compound lifts with the smith. Or would you rather recommend that I switch gyms instead, with access to a barbell?

Any advice is seriously appreciated. Thanks!

EDIT: a better way to rephrase is, would I get the same / similar results if I proceed with the smith? The goal is to just lower the fat percentage on my body. I'm also aware that dieting is a very very huge part of this, but this question is just for the workout part :D "
Disordered,"Sedentary lifestyle tips  Hey everyone! I was hoping to get some good suggestions if your situation is similar to mine. 

I used to struggle with a binge eating disorder and got to 160 at my highest (I am 5’7”, for reference). I went through a separation w my ex and dropped to 120 because I was too anxious and depressed to remember to feed myself regularly. I maybe weighed that little in middle school, it was not healthy for me. 

Since then, I have done a lot of work on myself, cut out dairy (a major trigger for me), went vegan, and eat fairly healthy nowadays. I will have some carbs (I eat a lot of veggie sandwiches w hummus) and sometimes a snack (I’m not big into sweets anymore since going vegan), but my weight has slowly grown to 150 even with a STARK difference in diet. This all being said, I feel like the biggest difference between now and then is that I live an incredibly sedentary lifestyle. I work from home at a “desk job” but don’t really have a space for an actual desk (so no standing desk), so I’m typically sitting on a couch or my bed all day. I’ve been trying to incorporate 30 min workouts with weights every day, but some weeks are extremely high-stress at work - I’ll work until late at night, and I don’t even have time (or energy) for exercise after getting off the clock at midnight. Then my established routine is out of whack and it’ll take me another month to force myself to start working out regularly again, work will get busy again, rinse and repeat. 

Is there anything I’m missing as far as things I could be doing differently? I know I need to just start taking 5 mins in between calls or documents and just crank out a few squats or leg lifts or SOMETHING involving the slightest movement (I swear my circulation is even worse than normal so anything would help), but wondered if anyone had creative methods of keeping active at home."
Neutral,"Requesting tips on Hip Thrusts and some questions  Hello All,

I'm trying to get better at hip thrusts. Reading a lot on how to do them.

1. When my legs are wider than shoulder width, I was able to squeeze glutes better than when they are in line with shoulder. Is this ok?
2. Feeling more in glutes when legs didn't come near to upper body, parallel to the ground and thrust up just before knee goes towards upper body  (similar to KAS bridge or 1/4 hip thrust).
3. After doing 10 reps on hip thrusts with 40 lbs, I start to feel in hamstrings then stopping the set. Does this mean, after 10 reps, my hamstrings taking over? My shins are vertical and legs not far from the body.
4. Mostly I feel in left glutes only. Though I did activation work, never able to feel anything in right glutes, how to fix this?
5. When doing RDLs, sometimes I feel at the top line of glutes, does this mean it's working glutes?

Disordered,"Favorite hypertrophy programs?  I'm finishing up Natacha Oceane's Build.Reload in the next week or two, and I'm considering what to do next. As we all know, buying programs and doing them are two different hobbies :D. I strongly prefer programs where I don't have to think too much beyond choosing weights, and I prefer an app vs printing/writing.

Right now I'm between going back to STBD or doing the GGS Get Jacked. STBD is strongly dependent on the next block focus. I originally left STBD to start Build Reload because I wasn't recovering well and needed a bit less heavy lifting, which is a reason I really like hypertrophy because I can manage my recovery easier while still making progress.

Programs I've completed:

* Natacha Oceane Build
* Natacha Oceane Build Reload
* JillFit LeanBuilding
* Stronger By The Day (have been off and on over the last two years)

Programs I own but haven't done:

* JillFit LeanPhysique
* GirlsGoneStrong Get Jacked
* Natacha Oceane Cut Reload
* Natache Oceane Move

I work from home and have a garage gym so I'm super flexible on timing, but I'm working full time and I'm about to start two online classes for my grad program so it's gonna be a lot. I'm trying to slowly build muscle without any specific goals while not overtaxing myself so I can still focus on the rest of life.

Would love any experiences from folks who have done the programs I own, or any other recommendations or experiences for other programs you think might be a good fit!"
Neutral,"Do I still need a trainer?  Hi everyone! I am new here and am excited to join the community 😊 I need some advice on whether I still need a trainer so any insight would be greatly appreciated. 

Background: I have been training with a strength coach for about seven years and for personal reasons, I had to “break up” with him. I have had no prior athletic background but he was able to turn that into someone who could squat her own weight, do 20 lb weighted chin ups, etc

Goal: strength training has now become a lifestyle and I want to continue being strong (not get stronger, just maintain) and well, continue looking good 😅

I’m not sure if I should now do it in my own or find another trainer? Feeling like I may be too dependent on a trainer to watch me perform exercises I already know how to do? I like having a trainer to make sure I don’t get hurt or to point out my weaknesses and help me address them.

Disordered,"Struggling to ""do it all"". Advice please?  
I've been really struggling with wanting to do it all recently which means balancing my very different fitness related goals as well as my hobbies that involve fitness as well as getting enough recovery time. A little on me, my goals and hobbies:

I'm a 23 year old woman. I had a personal trainer at the start of the year that really gave me a good start to my bodybuilding goals which are to get a nice a well rounded physique with an emphasis on glutes. Now I'm continuing what I've learned by myself and seeing decent all around progress. I'm currently doing lower body twice a week and upper body once a week. The reason for this is I also pole dance 2-5 times a week which is very upper body heavy, and the squats and deadlifts on leg day also add to the upper back soreness so I simply can't hit upper body anymore than once or else I won't recover (and I feel like thats still a struggle sometimes). But I still want to do that one upper body session at the gym so I can make sure I hit all those muscles properly, as well as work on my strength goals, which are to be able to do lots of pushups and pull ups. At the moment I've totally plateaued on those despite doing them once a week as always. When I started I improved a lot, going from 1 pushup to 19 consecutive ones, but then I went down to 15, and today I was only able to do 5...

On top of that I've completely neglected abs and cardio. I just want to be a generally well rounded athlete and be able to run a decent distance at a decent pace but where to fit that in? Then there's yoga, which I would also like go do, but despite being able to move decently heavy weights for 12ish reps, I can't for the life of me hold a simple yoga pose like warrior for 5 minutes. My bodybuilding strength doesn't really translate at all to real world strength but I still want to keep doing for the physique + I do enjoy the burn. Oh yea, I also want to start doing taking MMA lessons again but that is out of the question as I'm already struggling. And no matter how I've thought about focusing just on one goal I cant cause they're all to important. 

Sorry for the rant

TL;DR How to balance bodybuilding, cardio, pole dancing, yoga, strength training etc. and still being able to recover and have time for everything?"

Disordered,"Joined a lifting gym, owner said I shouldn't hire a trainer. I disagree.  I'm a beginner. I started lifting at home with dumbbells a few months ago and have been following a consistent routine for  7 weeks now. I'm ready to move up in weight (for the 3rd time now) and I want to continue to push myself to lift as heavy as possible. I joiner a lifting gym to access heavier weights as well as professionals who can teach me proper form and maximize my efficiency.

After signing up, the owner of my new gym dropped me off in the machine section and told me to basically play around with the machines for a month and said that it wouldn't be a good use of anyone's time for me to hire a trainer yet. But I feel lost. I'm totally fine with starting small, but I want to learn how to deadlift and squat and get help putting together a routine that will really push me. I also want help identifying which machines will be the most helpful with my personal goals. I don't need someone to hold my hand through every workout, I just want someone who knows what they're doing to get me started on the right track.

I'm not sure if I'm wrong for feeling disappointed, or if I should reach out to a trainer who isn't the owner and hire them anyway. As a beginner, I really don't know the etiquette here. Is this pretty standard? Any advice on how to proceed?

**Update:**

I want to thank everyone for all the support I have gotten here. Every comment helped me in making a decision on how to handle this situation.

I went in to the gym early today and asked the owner if he had a minute to talk with me, which he did. I told him that I want more guidance, and I showed him what I had been doing and went over how much weight I was using. I asked him if I was using the right machines, and if I was doing enough/on the right track. He went over my workouts, and said my leg routine was great, but that my upper body routine was lacking. He then took me through the gym and gave me a routine for arms and back/chest, and showed me how to properly perform the exercises. He brought me further into the gym than I had ventured on my own thus far, and included some barbell lifts in my new routine, which is something that I really wanted. I now have more confidence and feel welcome to do more serious work than when I first started.

He told me I am welcome to ask him questions, and pointed out two other trainers who he said would also be happy to answer any questions I have during my workouts. I did not broach the subject of hiring a trainer anyways, as I feel like I got what I wanted -I just expected to pay for it so I could feel entitled to the trainers time and advice. I know what to do now, and I have a timeline. He said to work on these routines for the next month, and then to hire a trainer. The trainers have their contact information on a bulletin board, so it is available to me if I decide that I really need one before the end of the next month. For now, I'm going to stick to the plan, work on matintaining proper form and increasing the weight I can handle, and look forward to having something to show for my work when I hire a trainer."

Neutral,"How much progress do you see on average in a year in your lifts?  I've been lifting roughly 3 times a week since Feb 2021. I don't think I'm particularly strong yet, but think I'm past quick 'newbie' improvements in weight I can lift. My pbs are: 
Squat - 72.5kg
Deadlift- 80kg
Ohp - 32.5kg
Chest press - 42.5kg 
I weigh 124-9ish lbs. 

My question is - how much of an improvement have you all seen in your lifts over the last year? 

I ask because a lot of what I have found online are about what you should add each session, in ideal circumstances. I'm not in ideal circumstances all of the time. At my best, for a few months of the year, I lift 3 times a week and run 3 times a week. At my worst (when not ill) I think I manage 4 sessions of random exercise. Most of the time I manage 5: 3 lifting, 2 some form of cardio. Since June, I've had Covid, been on holiday, gone to a music festival, am buying a house, applied for a new job, have had social commitments all weekend most weekends and lost 5lbs. My lifts have, understandably, decreased and I'm struggling to get them back to the pre-covid/v busy life levels. This kind of life stuff seems to happen most years at some point in the year, and honestly I get a bit discouraged with one of my favourite hobbies when I see no improvement. So - taking all of these life things into account, how much improvement do other ladies with similar routines see over a year, for example? I'd like to know that it's not a huge deal to get busy, honestly. And if it is going to mean I never see much progress, how I can make changes to try and keep up with life & fitness. Carry snacks everywhere? More efficient workouts? Ect

My health issues include spikes and dips in my blood pressure/pulse rate as well as episodes of cataplexy (temporary paralysis) under anxiety or stress, so I have to be careful...I don't think my diet needs much work, I eat fairly healthy (due to dietary restrictions I avoid most processed, greasy, fatty type foods) but I have no clue how to use the machines or what machines I should even be focusing on for my goals.

Can I have some advice? Maybe some words of encouragement? I'm so anxious and afraid I'll give up before I even get started. :-("

Neutral,"Training for 10k whilst on an intense hypertrophy program?  Hi! I'm currently doing Renaissance Periodization's Female Physique program which is 4x a week hypertrophy based program and is quite high volume. However, I've definitely neglected cardio so was considering signing up for a 10k race to motivate myself to train aerobically too. Would this be too much training to recover from? Does anyone have any running programs they'd recommend for the 10k?

My goal is to become a well-rounded ""athlete"". I don't necessarily want to be the strongest or the fittest but I'd love to be both strong and fit. I recently got my first pull up, as well as 30 unbroken pushups. Meeting goals like this has been so motivating. I feel STRONG which is amazing but I don't feel fit or fast (because I obviously haven't trained for it!!!)  I feel out of breath when doing high reps of lunges before any fatigue in my legs for example.

A slight secondary goal would be a tiny bit of fat loss. This isn't my focus at all but being slightly leaner would be nice. I know this is the result of a calorie deficit but I'm not looking to track calories at the moment ( have done previously for 3+ years). I'm focusing on high protein with plenty of vegetables.  Has anyone had experience of leaning out when adding training this way?

I've heard that long distance running improves both aerobic capacity and speed. Is it true that I'd be faster for sprinting as well? Would training for a 10k make me FEEL fitter in day to day life? Is this the best approach for my goals? 

Context: Have been weight training consistently for just over a year, previously ran a 10k in 55 mins 3 years ago.  Before this, I did CrossFit for a year.

Neutral,"Experience at Crossfit-y gyms as a non-Crossfit lifter?  The closest gym to my house is a gym that used to be affiliated with Crossfit. It's dropped the Crossfit branding, but seems to have kept the general structure -- lots of classes that do Crossfit-like functional fitness stuff, challenges like the Murph, etc.  They have all members take a 3-class ""fundamentals"" series that is billed as personal training but is geared to getting you ready to join in the not-crossfit-but-basically-crossfit classes.

They also have an open gym feature that allows members to show up and use the equipment any time. It's quite a bit more expensive than my current gym, but it's also closer, is open more hours, is less shady than the corporate entity that owns my current gym (which is locally famous for being near-impossible to cancel), and has a lot more space devoted to weightlifting. So the idea of switching over is pretty appealing to me.

(**Edited to clarify: I'm not asking about switching from my current lifting program to Crossfit classes, but about using a Crossfit gym's open gym hours to continue my non-Crossfit workouts.** The proximity of the gym is a big enough draw that I'd be willing to pay more -- it's literally across the street, which would save me 40 minutes total on days I work out -- but I want to make sure I'm asking the right questions/considering drawbacks I'm not aware of.)

Has anyone joined a gym like this as a solo lifter? What have your experiences been like? I'm planning to take a tour and meet the staff, but am curious about any experiences that could inform what I'm looking for or what questions I ask.

For the record, I have no particular opposition to ""Crossfit people"" or a deep hatred of Crossfit-like workouts or anything like that. I've enjoyed group functional fitness classes in the past and might again someday, but at the moment I'm really happy lifting on my own and then doing cardio on my own separately on other days. I don't particularly want a big sales pitch or a lot of pressure to switch up what I'm doing."

Neutral,"Weight gain but no strength increase with GZCLP  Hi there! I've been lifting for about 9 months, the last 5 of which I've been running GZCLP 3 days per week. My initial goal was rehabbing my back (chronic mystery lower back pain unsolvable by physical therapists and cortisone shots) and generally getting back into an exercise routine that was long gone mostly due to aforementioned back pain and now having a sedentary job. Not to mention get a little leaner. My back pain has eased some and I've got a little routine going, so now I want to focus on building muscle and losing fat.

The first 3 months or so of GZCLP I was enjoying it, and while making strength gains more slowly than I preferred, I definitely noticed changes in my body. At that point I'd been eating in a slight deficit and losing weight at about ¼ lb per week. I decided I was down to eat more, gain that muscle, be able to push harder in the gym, and see more progress.

So over the last couple months I started eating about 250 calories more per day, always prioritizing protein (about 110 grams per day at 134 lbs and 5'3"") and tracking macros most days, but working out has felt continually unpleasant and exhausting and I'm failing my lifts more than ever. I realize that failure is part of the program, and I do follow GZCLP protocols, but I'm getting discouraged and it makes me dread going to the gym. I've done 1 reset but after that I've been failing pretty much at the same spot I did before on all of my lifts. Also I gained 4 lbs, and while I do feel like I see some muscle growth, I don't feel strong so I it couldn't possibly be mostly muscle.

On top of that, I pushed too hard on bench press a couple weeks ago and hurt my shoulder and took about a week and a half off of all upper body. Then, in an effort to combat the fluff I was feeling, I tried adding in 2 30 minute run/walks per week since I used to be an avid runner, and now my knee is pretty unhappy with me (I think it's IT band syndrome due to issues probably related to my back pain, fun). I feel like I'm trying to fuel more so I can go just a little harder to see results and my body is NOT into it. I eat fairly ""clean"" with some treats thrown in in moderation as I love to cook and bake, drink plenty of water, get good sleep, and am lucky to have a pretty conventionally healthy lifestyle.

If you've made it this far, thanks for sticking with me. Is it time for a more dramatic GZCLP reset? Or a new program altogether? I feel like I haven't been at this long enough that I have to give up linear progression, but maybe my body isn't up for it. Thoughts? Advice?"

Height - 170 cm / 5'7""  
Weight - 52 kg / 115 lbs  
Age - 32

\---

I've been training Muay Thai since March and I'm now up to 5+ hours of MT a week (on 3 days) in addition to 2 days of bodyweight/band strength training and 1 day of mobility training a week.

In terms of progress, other than my trainer telling me my MT technique has exponentially improved, I do notice that my muscles (especially abs and biceps) have grown, I have much more ankle stability (from all of the bouncing on toes) and I don't huff and puff when going up hills anymore. I still can't do a real proper push-up (working through the progression), but I do feel I have gained a lot of strength.

Still, despite all this, I feel like there is something missing and my poor understanding of the elements of fitness is not helping. Basically, when I have to execute intense spurts of energy, I get gassed out and feel weak quickly. For example, in yesterday's training, we had to do [120 fast kicks](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxelTqzVZVCJXzCsMUwXqOw3svsztNPADb) (3 x 20 for each leg) and although I could do them the fastest (the advantage of being quite light I suppose) I felt really gassed out after about 40. I finished them all but the breaks between sets were getting longer and I just felt weak. What should I work on to get better at recovering between sets? This is the same thing that I need to work on between rounds of pad work as after each 3min round I get gassed out and feel heavy/tired.

Am I lacking in endurance? Maybe I'm going too hard and should pace myself? Is my mental perception of the fatigue getting in the way? (Probably.) Do any of you have exercises to suggest? I'm thinking HIIT and soccer field sprints (sprinting the long side and jogging the short for as long as I can).

I have a tendency to be hard on myself and I know that a part of this is me comparing myself to 20-something-year-old men that do this for a living... Seeing as less than a year ago I was deeply depressed and sleeping 12 hours a day I did start from nothing so I am proud of all the progress.

Still, I want to keep progressing.

Thanks in advance for the help."
Disordered,"Consistently needing 9-10 hours sleep/night  Hey all,

I've recently been in a pretty heavy training cycle (12-14 hours a week, with a down week of \~8 every 3 weeks or so). This consists of four runs per week (25-30 mpw), 3-4 mountain bike rides between 1.5-3 hours, and 3 full body strength sessions. I'm a 30 yr old female.

I've found that the past couple weeks I need consistently 9-10 hours of sleep and will nap a couple times a week too. This is pretty abnormal for me but definitely seems to help with recovery, though I'm surprised I can still go to bed early and sleep that much...

Disordered,"What is more important, heart rate or form?  I’ve been lifting weights at the gym for around 2 months now, & I’ve been doing the same “routine” with lifting the entire time because I wanted to focus on progressive overload. 

Last week I noticed that my form was starting to suffer because I had moved up in weights. I went back down in weight the last two workouts I’ve done to nail down the form. I’ve felt these workouts were pretty good, I could do more reps & did them until near failure. Side raises really benefitted from this as I could really do them right & I could feel it in my shoulders for a day or two after. 

However my heart rate was not at the level it was when I was working with slightly heavier weights. I definitely did not sweat as much during the workout & my smart watch confirmed this, I was around 120 the whole workout. 

How important is raising heart rate by lifting heavier weights? Is it worth it to try to perfect the movements even if it sacrifices some of the intensity of the workout? I want to find a balance between challenging myself & being able to correctly do movements but I don’t really know how to find a medium area here."

Neutral,"How should I approach indoor cycling as a beginner?  Hi all,

Apologies if this isn't accepted in this sub, and Tl;dr question at the bottom!

Once in a while, my friends and I will attend classes for spinning/indoor cycling. I (20s F) personally don't want to push myself too hard and risk injury while I'm new, so I slow down when the sessions get too intense and push where I know I can handle it.

One of my friend's boyfriends, Ken (20's M), joined a class for the first time, and he doesn't really do any level of cardio in his day-to-day life. He saw the other attendees (who probably spin regularly and did so for a long time) going hard, and effortlessly following the instructor. So he tried following their pace the whole session, which left him with really sore muscles/joints for a little over 2 weeks, even with rest and stretching.

I understand people who aren't used to intense cardio can feel sore for longer periods, but at most I've assumed DOMS recovery would at most take up to 1 week, not as long and intense as what Ken experienced. 

I was talking to another friend, Iggy (20s F), and I said that Ken should have just started at his own pace and over time work himself up to the regular attendees' levels, especially since he's still new to cardio and spinning. I feel that he pushed himself too hard and that while soreness is to be expected, his level of soreness was too extreme/unusual. I also said he likely didn't stretch right before and after. 

Iggy said cardio is different to exercises like weight training; people starting should/can go hard, and that 2 weeks' recovery period is normal (as long as it's muscle soreness and not an injury, like a pulled muscle/ligament etc). She reckons that people should push themselves from the start, until their body gets used to the intensity and learns to recover faster over time. She said the stretching wouldn't have made a difference. 

I figured I'd ask here to find out which is preferable, but to also understand if there's any damage/benefit to your muscles long term. I'd also like to know if I'm actually limiting myself with my current ""slow and steady"" method.

Tl;dr - friend says that, with cardio (unlike weight training) newbies can go hard and a 2ish week long soreness period is expected. They have to keep at that intense pace until their body gets used to it. I think with cardio, newbies should start at their own pace and slowly build up intensity, and that a 2ish week soreness period is a bit too much, even for the first time. I can't find anything to directly support either method, and want to know what's most recommended. 

Thanks in advance!"

Disordered,"Thoughts on Paragon / program rec’s  I searched the sub for reviews/feedback on Paragon training methods and most of what I found were over a year old. I know Meg Squats SBTD and Sohee Lee’s programs get a lot of love here (and are programs I am very much considering/interested in) but curious why I see so little about Paragon? I know everyone has their personal preferences/opinions but just trying to find the best program fit for me.

I’m currently doing functional fitness group strength training at a gym in person, we do a lot of the main lifts, kettlebell stuff, dumbbell stuff, and small bits metabolic/cardio stuff like rower, air bike, etc. I think I’m pretty spoiled to have access to this gym, been going about a year now and I love it. The problem is that I’m moving to a more rural part of town and will be about 40 minutes away from my current gym. I’m currently going there about 3x per week with my goal being 4x per week. I’m hoping to still go once I move, but will likely only go twice per week at best, and want a solid home program for the other days.

From checking out other posts, I think lift with Sohee might be a good fit because she has a two day option, and I love hip thrusts, haha. But to get back to my main question, I’m oddly drawn to the paragon programs. Maybe it’s the physique focus? I love their messaging and found their IG page pretty useful/inspiring. It’s funny/weird to me because I don’t think I would want to be friends with LCK in real life, and jive more with Sohee Lee’s persona/presence. But I’m interested in a good program fit not personality fit, if that makes sense.

Neutral,"Exercise, depression and hope  I've struggled depression for a long time. Sometimes exercise would help me feel better and sometimes it would make me feel worse. On days when I have the energy to, I've been playing around with different factors to see if I could make any connections. 

For as long as I can remember I've been an over achiever and a perfectionist. It was a mindset that I brought into every single part of my life. School, work, social interactions, exercise - everything was black and white - I either did it perfectly or I was a failure. I never did do anything perfectly.

No one can change a mindset that has seeped into every part of your life overnight, and I am no exception.  After I realised my problem I tried really hard to simply not do it, but that, as I'm sure you can imagine, didn't really work. Eventually I decided that I would pick one area of my life and focus on developing a healthier mindset in that specific area. I chose exercise. Instead of following rigid plans with splits and rep counts and lots of opportunity for me to push myself too far, I decided to just do what feels nice. Some days that means five minutes of breath work or stretching, other days it means calisthenics at the local outdoor gym. I've changed my focus from always pushing myself yet never being good enough to just showing up. My only goal is to do something everyday. I even changed the music that I listen to during my workouts, from pumped up pop music to calm pop or indie acoustics to remind myself that exercise, for me, is not about pushing myself or performing. It's about me telling myself that I am worthy of being taken care of.

My point with this post isn't to shame anyone, or say that anyone's way of exercising is wrong. If you enjoy pushing yourself with your workouts, or to have performance goals to keep you motivated that's great! My point is to encourage you to make sure that your exercise regimen is something that benefits *you* and *your* goals as much as possible, and that you're not just doing something because you think that you are supposed to."

Neutral,"LONG term diet changes  So I’ve had some food for thought the past couple weeks (pun intended) - specifically about protein. I’m early on in my fitness ‘journey’ but loving feeling strong and eating well. I’m making sure I get my minimum protein (112g per day) while on a slight cut. To get this I really need to focus on meal planning and usually have 2 shakes a day. I’m totally okay with this but I’m wondering how important the role of protein is when you’re maintaining, vs cutting or bulking. I’m sort of picturing myself at 60 years old trying to stay fit and maintain the muscle I’ve built up over my life… will I still be needing 2 shakes a day to ensure I get my protein? If so, sure. But I’m curious about the science behind holding onto muscle. If I bulk then cut until I’m muscled, fit and happy and want to maintain for my whole life, can I then get away with working out 3-5 times a week, eating at maintenance but maybe only getting 60-100g a day without muscle atrophy?

I often see government standards suggesting women get 45ish g of protein a day which is obviously very different to what I hear on these threads. 

So I have questions/thoughts 
- how does ageing effect protein intake 
- how much protein do you need to retain muscle or is it only/mostly about calories at that point 
- is protein more important on a cut or bulk?

I would love to hear if people have science based resources on this too 😊"

I’m stuck at 45 lbs (bar) for the OHP and at around 20lbs for dumbbell presses, and can perform 8-10 reps max before starting to sacrifice form. I also usually do the dumbbell presses single armed and get out of breath very quickly when performing the reps. Could it be a breathing problem, maybe a stabilization issue, or something else? Has anyone experienced the same issue? Thank you:)

Edit: I guess I’ll finally start following an actual program as advised. Gonna try the 5/3/1 on Boostcamp, hope to see progress soon!"

So when I saw this video trend going around tiktok of people picking up couches (https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRyjDsN2/), I was like ""Omg extremely cool! Teach me your ways!!How can I do that?! Let me go ask XXfitness!""

Yes it's a ridiculous question I guess but seriously, how do women specifically achieve the body strength to be able to do this? Do women generally have a harder time building certain types of ""lifting"" strength compared to men, or is it more of a body weight, age, and muscle thing regardless of gender? I understand very little about workouts so I'd love explanation for motivation."

Disordered,"Body recomp - am I going in the right direction?  I’m 151lbs and 5’5. My goal is to lose body fat and possibly some weight. I don’t have a goal weight or anything. I just want to look less squishy. 

I’ve been doing home work outs for the past 4 months. My workout consists of 
using dumbbells and cardio. I do upper body and lower body exercises with dumbbells once a week. I’ve been slowly increasing the amount of reps/sets I do. For cardio, I do 30min of cardio 3x a week.

I eat 1800 calories and 80-90g of protein a day. I weigh myself once a week and take my measurements once a month. 

After 4 months of working out, I’ve only recently started seeing the smallest amount of change. My weight has gone down by 2lbs. I’ve also lost 3 inches off my stomach, the rest of my measurements are the same. 

I’ve heard that body recomp is a very slow process but I’m doubting myself. I’m not sure if I’m even going in the right direction since there’s only been such a small amount of change. I’m worried that all the effort that I’ve been putting in will be a waste. 

I know that if I were to eat under my maintenance calories I would see noticeable results a lot sooner. I have tried that it the past but I found it too restricting. I felt hungry and tired all the time. I had to chose between what I wanted to eat vs what would be better to keep my hunger away. There was only so much I could fit into my daily calorie intake. I also didn’t have as much energy for workouts and often times I would feel a lot more hungry after exercise. I did lose a bit of weight and saw some changes in my appearance, but I was miserable throughout the whole process. It wasn’t sustainable for me. Especially looking at it long term. 

Right now I like where I’m at. I feel like I have enough space with my calorie intake to enjoy the foods that I like while also being able to fuel myself and keep myself full."

This question isn't only for amputees but I'm giving some background as to why I can't squat.

I'm fairly new and don't lift much at all, so I haven't had any issues and I'm able to do them perfectly, but recently I've been reading that smith machine squads aren't good.

Disordered,"[Powerlifting Meet Report] Olympus Summer Showdown | 30 yo F 82.5kg Open  ## Your background

I've casually lifted weights for many years, but didn't follow a program until about one year ago. Once COVID hit back in 2020, my gym closed and I cancelled my YMCA membership. My husband and I bought a Peloton, so I only did cardio for about 9 months - give or take. Once we were ready to get back into a gym to lift, we joined a gym with our closest friends (best decision ever, everyone needs a lifting squad). My bestie suggested GZCLP as a good starting point since I was a bit rusty with lifting and I had never followed a program before. Two rounds of GZCLP later, I fell in love with powerlifting! I wasn't putting up crazy numbers, but I loved pushing myself to my limits. There was something so empowering about lifting heavy and I was hooked.

## Training

I signed up for my first meet sometime around April or May just to do something that got me out of my comfort zone. I had zero expectations going into this meet other than to have fun and learn more about the sport. I started to run a third cycle of GZCLP but admittedly made it a bit too tough. I got really ambitious with my T3 accessories - whoops! After running this third cycle for a couple of weeks, COVID finally got me and I didn't have the best go with it. While I was recovering, a powerlifting coach reached out to me (because I got on her waitlist) and we discussed what one on one coaching would look like. I signed up with her and it was easily the best decision I could have made. I started her programming in mid May and she helped me so much with form corrections and breaking through mental barriers. I initially questioned spending the money for a coach, but I have already learned so much with her in just a few short months. I'm not the best at self-motivating, so having someone hold me accountable was a giant push that I desperately needed. Going into her coaching me, my 1RM for bench, squat, and deadlift were 95lbs, 195lbs, and 215lbs. My 1RM are now 115lbs, 209lbs, and 264lbs. 

## Diet

I've been tracking macros for right around two years now, so I hovered around my maintenance calories throughout this entire prep. I didn't want to attempt a cut for my first meet, so I opted to stay put within the 82.5kg weight class. However, going into my next meet which is in November, I am hoping to cut 10lbs to go down a weight class. Since I have three months, my coach felt like this was a goal that I could easily reach by then without cutting into my strength/performance. For this cut, I will be doing high calorie days for lifting days and low calorie days for non-lifting days. I will also be incorporating a few Peloton classes back into the mix each week for some cardio. 

## Meet Day

God I was so nervous yet so excited. One of my absolute favorite people on this planet [u/broccyncheese](https://www.reddit.com/user/broccyncheese/) did the meet with me and it truly made all the difference. We did a short practice run of meet day together where we wore our singlets to the gym, practiced commands, etc. Meet day itself was a whirlwind. It was so well run, everything was super smooth, and the judges were very kind when I asked what I missed on an attempt. My husband was my handler for the day, and he helped keep me calm yet hyped up. My best friend was there along with some family. It was truly a core memory type of day. I had so much fun, I did something way out of my comfort zone, and my favorite people/strong squad were there with me. I genuinely can't imagine doing another meet without a friend competing next to me. It was my favorite thing! 

Squat Attempts: 82.5kg - 3 white lights, 90kg - 3 red lights due to jumping my rack command, 95kg - 2 white lights (locked my knees after the squat command). 95kg was a small PR so that was cool!

Bench Attempts: 45kg - 3 white lights, 50kg - 3 white lights, 55kg - absolutely failed. My coach told me to go for 52.5kg as my third attempt and lesson learned to listen to her next time!

Deadlift Attempts: 102.5kg - 3 white lights, 110kg - 3 white lights, 120kg - 3 white lights. 120kg was a big PR for me so I rode that high for the rest of the weekend haha. 

## Thoughts and going forward

I just started meet prep round 2 with my coach yesterday! I'm super excited to jump back into training. She has me working on a low bar squat since I have always squatted high bar. Working with her since May has been such a positive experience, so I'm really excited to see what this second round of meet prep looks like! I learned so much this weekend, had such a great time, and can't wait to do it all again soon.

Disordered,"Lifting making me sleep more?  Hi all,

I’m 33F and I’ve been lifting and running on and off for a few years. Never progressed beyond a 10K (once) or ~100lb squat, due to lack of consistency.

I’m finally getting into the gym 3 times a week to lift, plus a run once a week if I feel like it. I’ve also started intermittent fasting and cut out alcohol. I’m eating between 12p-8p, but not changing what I eat. (As much pasta, fish, chocolates, cheese, etc. as I want.) 

I’m a very good sleeper and I usually sleep 8 hours and wake up. Lately I’ve noticed my body wanting closer to 9 hours of sleep. Have others noticed this kind of change when starting to lift more regularly? Is it not eating enough protein? Something else? When I wake up I feel great — no fatigue and my lifts are progressing without issue. I just start getting very sleepy earlier, and don’t feel well-rested without 9 hours. Any thoughts welcome!

EDIT: thank you all for sharing your experiences!! Sounds like this is super normal. Thankfully, I am able to find the time for an extra hour of sleep, so I'm going to embrace my new reality of passing out at 9pm."

Disordered,"(Sorta) Program Review: Lift With Sohee  *Previously from me under another username:* [GZCLP as an almost total beginner](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/qvi1pv/program_review_gzclp_as_an_almost_total_beginner/)*.*

**Tl;dr:** I tried Sohee Lee's monthly plan, Lift With Sohee, because I was getting bored with GZCLP, wanted a two-day training option, and really love Sohee's expertise, principles, and content. After a couple of months, I've decided it's not right for me right now for personal reasons, but there was a lot that I liked about it and I would still recommend it to others -- it depends on your goals/what you're looking for.

**About the program:** Lift With Sohee is Sohee Lee's monthly training program for intermediate to advanced lifters. Every month has a different focus (for example, bench + deadlift or glutes + shoulders), and you get a new training plan every month. Sohee also sells ""Year of Strength,"" which is a full year of Lift with Sohee workouts that you can access at once.

It's $23 per month, but you get a discount for paying for multiple months at once.

**What the workouts are like:** It's hard to generalize because Sohee offers a ton of options (more on that in a second). But they all include heavy compound lifts that strengthen the primary areas of focus, then lower weight/higher rep sets or supersets of other compound lifts or accessories. There are lots of variations -- we did pause squats, pulse squats, goblet squats, back squats, etc.

I was usually in the gym for about an hour, counting the recommended dynamic warmups.

**What else you get:** If you subscribe monthly (not to Year of Strength), there's a Facebook group where Sohee and her trainers offer form checks, modifications, and advice. It's a fun community and they respond very quickly. There's no app yet (I think one is in the works), which didn't bother me -- it took 10 minutes to create new templates in Strong, which is what I use for tracking anyway. But I know that's a big deal for some people, and obviously a dedicated app would be very nice.

**My experience:** I had been lifting for about a year with GZCLP and I was getting bored. I wanted to switch to a 2-day per week routine to focus more on running. I did two months of LWS, and although I liked some things about it, I've decided to take a break from it and go back to GZCLP

This is partly because I was sidelined for a few weeks by illness and injury, and I want to rebuild with a program I know well and can modify. But I also realized I was pretty excited about doing GZCLP again, and I was not that excited about starting a new month of LWS.

I still think Sohee is awesome, I don't regret paying for the program, and I might try again in a year or two. But it's not the right fit for me right now.

I don't think it's fair to discuss results since I didn't commit to the program long-term.

**What I liked about it:**

* The options are incredible. The monthly plan is really 8 different workouts: a 2-day program, a 3-day program, an optional 4th day to accompany the 3-day program, and a 4-day upper/lower split. Then each program has both a gym version (for those with access to a commercial gym or a very well-equipped home gym) and a home version (which can be done with dumbbells, resistance bands or even makeshift weights). I did most of my workouts in the gym, but I did the home versions about once a month when I otherwise would have had to skip a workout. The variety of programming, and the underlying philosophy that training needs to fit into your life, is really great.
* The coaching for individual exercises was strong. Each exercise comes with a walkthrough video with form cues and a GIF if you just want a quick refresher on, say, what a pause squat should look like. She includes rep ranges and rest times.
* The Facebook group was great!
* The programming seemed thoughtful. I'm not an expert by any means, but I am a nerd who likes to understand the theory behind what I'm doing. The structure was somewhat familiar to me from having done GZCLP -- heavy weight/low reps for big compound exercises, then lower weight/higher reps for other compound exercises, then accessories.
* There's a lot of variety in exercises, both the compound lifts and the accessories. All the variety sometimes felt a little overwhelming, but I enjoyed learning new movements and new ways of doing movements I already knew.

**What didn't work for me:**

* The big thing is that I thought I was an intermediate lifter and I am not. I think this would be a great program for someone who has eked out all the linear progression gains they can and is really comfortable with their form on major compound lifts. I'm not actually there yet; I hadn't hit a ceiling on GZCLP, I just got bored. The variety of LWS was a fun change, but the learning curve and added complications could also be pretty frustrating -- it was hard to gauge how heavy my weights should be since so much was new to me, the setup was more complicated than it is for GZCLP, etc. If I felt like I needed to add those complications to make gains, I might have felt differently about it, but as it is, I found myself missing the relatively straightforward workouts I'd been doing for the past year.
* The learning curve was pretty steep. There were a lot of things I'd never done before, and while I enjoyed the challenge and variety, I was never 100% confident that I was doing the movements right or using the appropriate amount of weight. I was a little shy about asking for help in the Facebook group (it's hard to film form checks at my gym, for one), so this may be partially on me.
* The supersets didn't always align with how my very busy commercial gym is set up: I'd either need to be in multiple places at once, or occupy a lot of equipment during peak periods. Not really the programming's fault, but it added stress and complication to my workouts.
* I don't like changing programs so often (every month is a totally new set of workouts). By the time I felt like I had the flow of the workout down, was using the right amount of weight, understood the movements, etc., it was time to do something new. Maybe that will change as I become more experienced, and maybe it won't.
* Finally, a small thing: I really, really do not like hip thrusts, and Sohee programs a lot of hip thrusts, including as a primary compound lift. I had not done them before, they are annoying to set up in my gym, I'm not confident in my form, I think I contributed to a back strain by screwing them up... I am trying to tell myself that I'm just new at them and I'll like them more as I improve, but I honestly have no desire to do them ever again.

**This program would be good for you if:**

* You're an intermediate or advanced lifter who has maxed out basic linear progression gains and want to mix it up to keep making progress.
* You like variety! Lots of different variations on the big lifts, and a new program every month. If novelty is a motivator for you, you will not get bored.
* You like a lot of options for how to fit your programming into your life, not vice versa.
* You like and are willing to invest in working out at home, or have access to a good commercial gym at non-peak times
* You don't hate hip thrusts

**It might not be right for you if:**

* You want programming clearly focused on a single goal (strength, aesthetics, etc). I'm pretty confident you could make lifting progress, but it's a little more geared toward all-around fitness than other intermediate programming I've seen
* You want to focus on one program for longer than a month
* You hate hip thrusts

**Edited to add:** I had one piece of bad luck which probably affected my overall opinion of the program: the first month of LWS was full of exercises I hadn't done, that were annoying to set up, or that were fne but didn't get me excited about the gym. The second month had my two favorite lifts (bench and deadlift), some cool variations of familiar favorites (one-armed lat pulldown) and some new-to-me accessories that I liked immediately (reverse barbell lunges), plus hip thrusts as an accessory rather than a main lift. It still had some of the aspects I didn't like (I gave up on one superset because I would have had to run from one side of the gym to the other, and I was never quite sure if I was lifting the right amount of weight), but if I'd started in July instead of June, my enduring first impression might have been ""this is different but it rules"" and not ""wow this is different and complicated and I dunno if I like it."" I think my ultimate assessment of my skill level vs. the intended audience is right, and was the real issue here -- I'm just not an intermediate lifter yet -- but I might have been more willing to push through anyway if circumstances had been different."
Neutral,"Menstrual cycle & training myths  Just listened to a great podcast this morning on myths about the menstrual cycle and training. I know this is a popular topic around here so thought I'd share. [Here's the YouTube version of the podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaOn7pfA8QU), or you can find it under ""The Messy Middle"" on your podcast app. The host is a researcher who just finished her PhD on the topic of how menstrual cycle and birth control affect training. 

A couple takeaways: 

* Training throughout the month is beneficial to your health and to athletic performance, you don't need to stop training or shift to a different type of training during any particular part of the cycle.
* In the luteal phase (the 2 weeks or so before your period) you MAY find performance more difficult or that you need more recovery time. Some people do, some don't, and just because it happens some months does not mean it will happen every month.
* Nutrition, including adequate carbs, can counter some of those negative/stressful effects in the luteal phase if you do struggle with that.
* IF you already know you want to take it easy during some portion of the month (for example, you do 4-week cycles that include a one week deload) it makes sense to put that deload during the luteal phase rather than the follicular. But there is no evidence to say that you should ADD a deload if you are currently training straight through the month.
* Other stresses in our lives (work, sleep, nutrition, etc) tend to have a bigger effect on our training than hormone fluctuations."
Neutral,"Fitness, Pregnancy, Birth and Beyond  Fitness, Pregnancy, Birth and Beyond

A number of months ago I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/snzppc/how_pregnancy_has_affected_my_fitness/) about how pregnancy affected my fitness.

Well, I’m now six and a half weeks post birth and thought I’d tell you the rest of the story.  We left off when I was 22 weeks pregnant, a bit over halfway through.  [Here I am at 25 weeks](https://imgur.com/a/LKH21pM).

Everything was going absolutely swimmingly, I was looking and feeling great, working out three to four times a week, and while my bump was getting bigger, the weights I was lifting were getting smaller, as per the instructions from my women’s physiotherapist.  [Here’s me](https://imgur.com/a/znfguj0) at 30 weeks benching 35kgs.  I had next to no fatigue, no nausea, and my one craving was ice-cream (which I fully indulged in).  I was busily planning my home for the birth I was planning to have there, and was having a pregnancy that was, from a medical perspective, an absolute snoozefest.  My 35-week ultrasound showed a baby that was happy and healthy, and the doctor advised that there was no need for any further ultrasounds.  My baby dropped into the pelvis at 35 weeks and while this was a new and uncomfortable feeling, I still had no problem getting through workouts.

And that’s when it all went wrong.  At 36 weeks, my younger sister asked me to come over to take care of her baby for a few hours while she had a job interview.  I was happy to do this.  The day after, both she and I woke up feeling not so great, and by evening we both felt absolutely terrible (and I threw up so hard I was genuinely worried I was going to break my waters and *did* actually break a blood vessel in my oesophagus).  TL;DR: we both [had Covid](https://imgur.com/a/DuSEpj7).  While my sister basically just had a bad cold for a week, Covid for me set in place a sequalae of events that ended up with me having polyhydramnios, pre-eclampsia, a baby that came out of the pelvis and wouldn’t go back in, severe swelling (pitting oedema) from my feet all the way up my back (including a face that looked like I’d been on a three-day bender), blood pressure that went from 100/60 to 150/100, and short-term damage to my liver and kidneys.  Oh, and my placenta was more or less destroyed.  Naturally, Covid basically put paid to any further workouts during my pregnancy, especially considering that I could no longer fit my feet in my Metcons, let alone actually walk properly.  Since a homebirth is only safe for women who are low risk, and trying for a vaginal birth was very much not recommended, I ended up having a caesarean.  Thankfully, my baby was absolutely fine during all of this.

Now, while there is no possible way to bench and deadlift your way out of pre-eclampsia (either before or during), every single bit of strength training that I did during my pregnancy came in handy during the birth and the post-natal period.  Here are some examples:

-	During my caesarean, my abdominal muscles were so tight that the two doctors had difficulty extracting my son, despite him not being even remotely in the pelvis.  They had to pause the surgery to call in the most senior doctor in the hospital to give them guidance on what to do.  The two choices were to extend the incision on my abdomen or use forceps to pull him out through it.  They ended up going with the forceps.  They talked to me during all of this and remarked repeatedly that this was the first time in either of their careers that they had come across this problem.  My strong abdominal muscles meant that the huge amount of excess amniotic fluid that I had inside didn’t balloon my abdomen out or cause abdominal separation.  It also meant that my abdomen shrunk back incredibly quickly.  [Here’s me](https://imgur.com/a/NA65GaP) four days after surgery taking the elevator down to the hospital café for a sandwich.

-	While I was in the recovery area and still had no feeling in my legs, I slipped quite a way down the bed and needed to get back to the top of it.  Two midwives were preparing to hoist me under the arms and bring me back up again, but I was able to use my upper body strength to put my hands on the bed railings and basically do a dip that started at the bottom rather than at the top

-	Overnight on the first night that my son was born he was in his cot right next to my bed.  It was not possible to twist around in order to use both hands to pick him up, but I had the strength (and confidence in that strength) to grab onto the front of his onesie with one hand and lift him into bed with me when he cried so I could breastfeed him

-	Years of training has meant that I am comfortable with being uncomfortable.  I was up and walking within hours of giving birth, basically as soon as the spinal wore off and I was able to move my legs again.  I wouldn’t say it was a pain free experience, but it was one I was able to power through while keeping my limits clearly in mind

-	My abdominal healing has been incredibly fast.  I sustained quite a lot of blood loss during the surgery, but none of it was from the placental site: it was all from the musculature that the doctors cut through to get to the uterus.  The doctors commented on this as well, saying that the area was incredibly vascular and that this would mean it would heal swiftly.  They were right, I was back in my pre-pregnancy jeans within five days.  [This is me](https://imgur.com/a/aazXGyS) one week post-partum.

-	This is more to do with diet, but since meal prepping has been part of my life for probably four years now, I prepped around 70 healthy meals while I was pregnant and put them all in my deep freezer.  As a result, I’ve eaten incredibly well from the moment I came home from the hospital

I felt physically ready to return to the gym long before I actually did.  But I held off, and went and saw a women’s physiotherapist beforehand in order to get professional clearance.  She examined my pelvic floor (no issues), my abdomen for abdominal separation (DRAM) which I also didn’t have, and took me through a range of exercises to test my core, leg and upper body strength and explosive power.  She said I could start whenever I wanted, and gave me some tips on helping my surgical scar to heal as well as possible.

I had my first session back today, six and a half weeks after I gave birth.  With my trainer by my side, we did bench press and deadlifts in sets of eight, with a working weight of 35kgs.  I then did landmine presses and RDLs.  From how the workout went and [how I looked](https://imgur.com/a/aCKAj5S), I can tell you that I feel as though I’m going to need to build my quads and glutes basically from scratch, but my upper body has fared pretty well.

In terms of weight gain, due to all the fluid retention I had, I expect that I weighed close to 80kgs (175lbs) when I gave birth (I was 60kgs when I conceived).  All of that fluid was gone within a week, and by four weeks after birth I was back down to 65kgs, but with a different body composition.  Lower body muscle has been depleted, and my stomach is a lot softer.  My breasts are now simply enormous.  Some of that weight loss is probably due to the calories consumed by producing breast milk: I have an oversupply and am exclusively breastfeeding my son plus expressing 300ml (10oz) per day which I then store in my freezer.  I am incredibly hungry and thirsty as well, but with all the meal prepping I did, the meals I have are good quality (though we do not talk about the snacking that takes place in between).   I would say I’m burning something like 700cals per day through breastmilk production alone, and am maybe eating 3000 calories per day total.

TL;DR: my pregnancy was perfect until I got Covid and then I became extraordinarily unwell when it left my placenta basically non-functional.  However, all the strength and fitness training I did during my pregnancy paid off ten-fold during my recovery.  If you have the ability: keep working out when you’re pregnant, you won’t regret it.

Final thoughts and a controversial opinion: pregnancy is spoken about in ways that make it seem as though health and fitness will have no bearing on it.  As though everything is a crapshoot, and it’s all a matter of luck.  While I absolutely agree that you can’t control if you get things like hyperemesis / debilitating fatigue / excruciating SPD etc, I find it hard to get on board with everyone agreeing that health and fitness improves every aspect of life from birth to death unless you are pregnant at which point all bets are off.  Does being fit and healthy guarantee an easy pregnancy and birth?  Definitely not.  Do I think fit and healthy people generally (though not always) have an easier time than their unfit and unhealthy counterparts?  Yes I absolutely do.  I’m living, walking proof that deadlifts and protein shakes don’t prevent you getting life threatening complications like pre-eclampsia, but I am also living, walking proof that your body will recover much better if you partake in them.

Final final thing: [here is my son, Winter](https://imgur.com/a/YNBqFE0).

Though I have completed 2 half marathons and some other races, I would consider myself a beginner-intermediate  runner, so any advice is welcome :)

My training includes a tempo day (playing around with speed, so I can run faster), a cross training day, several ""normal days"", a slow long distance day, and a recovery day. I want to try to keep my recovery days on Mondays since I tend to be busy and really tired on Mondays lol, but I am open to moving my other days around. I'm considering adding another cross training day instead of 3 miles on Saturday. My training schedule for my last half (earlier this year) is pretty similar, but I had more time to train.

EDIT: This schedule was taken from [this](https://www.halfmarathons.net/8-week-half-marathon-training-schedule/) website and was slightly modified. I have been running, doing pilates, walking, and some light weight training since my last half (which was in April), so I haven't been averaging a lot of miles per week. I am going into this half to push myself to accomplish another race and get myself back in running after taking a break during a family emergency. "
Disordered,"What’s the average break time between sets? Gym etiquette  I had just finished my first set (10x3) and had rested not even 15 seconds when a guy asked if he could jump in and do two sets. I said I’m almost finished anyways

I only take 30-60s between sets because I’m a beginner and not pushing myself yet.  Overall, I had been on the machine like 1-2 minutes max. 

Do most people take longer breaks between? I guess I would ask if I saw someone taking long breaks between sets, but I hadn’t done that.  

Basically, is this a normal request? Bc from my perspective, this dude asked if I could just give up the machine. Did he expect us to take turns (my rest break is his set?)

Edit: I learned what “working in” is and he must have asked to do that! I legitimately thought he wanted me to wait patiently while he did his thing. I did not realize he was asking to take turns. Either way I was gone in 3 minutes, haha!"
Neutral,"[Powerlifting Meet Report] Olympus Summer Showdown | 31 yo F 60kg Open  # Your background

I've been engaged in some sort of fitness for the last 5 years. I've cycled through lots of different things- namely cycling, crossfit, running, and weight training. I spent 2020/2021 working with a coach and focusing solely on olympic weightlifting. In November 2021, I injured my hand doing a clean and could not hold a barbell or really any form of weights for that matter. I started running a lot, but by January, the lack of strength training paired with my quick ramp into running left me with a back injury. In hindsight, I should have seen it coming, my back was feeling achy and tight but I didn't pay it much attention. Then one day after a long trail run, it pushed it too far and I was in a lot of pain...pain that didn't just go away, it actually just got worse and worse. I couldn't stand to sit for any extended amount of time. I have an amazing sports physical therapist who assured me that getting back to strength training was imperative to get my back healthy.

# Training

Since I was starting with very low weight for me I decided to run nSuns- if I couldn't push weight at least I could see how my body would react to volume. This program is tough, most of your training volume comes from the main lifts (squat, bench, deadlift.) My accessories were based around my PT protocol (hip thrusts, back extensions, single arm farmers carries, rotational work, core, etc.) A couple weeks into training my back was feeling better and better, and my dear friend was signing up for her first powerlifting meet, and she enthusiastically supported me tagging along and signing up. We were about 2 months out. Did I know I was going to lift absolutely nothing compared to everyone at the meet? Yes. Did I also know I needed something to relight the fire in me so that I would stop the pity party and start focusing on progress? Yes. When I started the program I was squatting 52kg (115lbs), benching 47 kg (105lbs), and deadlifting 66kgs (145lbs). My old PBs were 95kgs (210lbs)/57kgs (125lbs)/120kgs (265lbs). My goal was to get back to 80ish% of those numbers. Training went really well considering and my back was feeling better and better as I continued to lift. I struggled a lot with the comp bench standards, but a week out I managed to PR my bench at 130lbs with my husband calling comp cues. I was stoked. My best attempts in training were 84kg (185lb) squat, 59kg (130lb) comp bench, and 105kg (232lb) deadlift. But one week out I was feeling like absolute SHIT. I struggled on a 175lb squat, and saw stars doing a 200lb deadlift. Idk what that was about at all but it got in my head big time.

# Diet

I've been tracking macros for years, I haven't been in a deficit since like 2019. I am 5'2"" 130ish lbs. My macros are something like 50% carbs, 25% protein, 25% fat and I average about 2200 cals a day. This is maintenance for me as long as I'm not doing a lot of cardio. I didn't cut for the meet, just signed up for the class I knew I'd be in. I signed up for the 60kg (132lbs) class, after having a low volume day because of travel, I weighed in at 57.5kg (126.5lbs).

# Meet

Holy shit I was stressed. Don't get me wrong, I was so stoked, but it was also a complete unknown situation to me. We also traveled to this comp because my city doesn't really host any, and that impacted me WAY more than I expected. We got stuck in gridlock traffic for an hour on the way there and I was so stressed about missing weigh ins (but I didn't, phew.) I slept like shit the night before.

My goal for the meet was to get a class II total for the 60kg class which meant a 245kg/540lb total.

I was the first lifter of the day!! No surprise there. There were only 6 woman in the whole meet.

\*Squats\*

* 80kgs (176lbs)- e z p z except I unracked the bar sideways and had to step it back in and re rack it.
* 82.5kgs (181.5lbs)- exactly the same as 80kgs. The middle judge called over my sister (my \~coach\~ for the day) and told her to come out on my last attempt and center me. Random note but that guy also kind of MCed the event and he was phenomenal.
* 85kgs (187lbs)- A post injury PR! I probably could have gone for 87.5 or 90kgs but it was so nice to come out of the squats confident and without a single red light. I didn't jump a cue! Also side note, but the back spotter was a woman who was hyping me up and it made my entire day.

\*Bench\*

I was SO hype for bench. Training was going so well. I was hunting for 60kgs.

* 52.5kg (115.5lbs)- literally flew, didn't jump any cues, felt great
* 57.5kgs (126.5lbs)- I FAILED IT. This totally knocked me on my ass. I did this weight for my top set of nSuns for 3 weeks straight. Even with someone calling the comp cues for me. I was sad but I was like yo, I can do this.
* 57.5kgs (126.5 lbs)- womp womp, another fail. Not gonna lie, this shit hurt. But in hindsight, I think I learned more BECAUSE I failed. 1) Eat a fucking snack after you squat. 2) I need to practice longer pauses in my training. That comp pause is no joke.

\*Deadlift\*

I left the venue to go eat lunch. I was being emo about the bench but apparently I was just hungry. I felt WAY better after I got some fresh air and ate. I knew going into the DL I needed to hit 107.5kg (236.5lbs) to get my class II goal total. Since my confidence was shot after my bench, I did 105kgs in warm up. I was opening at 100kgs lol. I just needed that reminder that I COULD do it.

* 100kgs (220lbs)- so easy
* 107.5kgs (236.5lbs)- a little grindy- I got one red light due to slightly hitching off my thighs (I think? It was really hard to hear.) When I put in my last attempt, the guy told me to baby powder my legs so that wouldn't happen next time. I think if I hadn't got that red light I would have gone for 115kgs but instead I went conservative.
* 110kgs (242lbs)- I think my overall best lift of the day and a post injury PR. Three whites!

**TOTAL 247.5kgs/545lbs @ 57.5kgs/126.5lbs**\- I hit my goal of class II total even though my bench didn't go as planned. [Here are some videos from my attemps!](https://imgur.com/a/9JTJZ8s)

This meet was so, so well run. It moved fast, the loaders and judges were extremely professional, everyone was so kind. I was insanely impressed. I wish there was a way I could tell them how amazing the experience was!

# Thoughts and going forward

The day was honestly very anxiety inducing for me. It was just a whole jumble of unknowns and first times, plus I have BIG anxiety about being perceived (lol) so being on a stage was super weird. Also I felt pretty imposter-y, like maybe I didn't deserve to be up there lifting that total when everyone else was ripping SO much weight. In the end I knew none of that mattered though, and that I could only compare myself to myself, and I came SUCH a long way in such a short period of time. I am so, so proud of myself for doing something so out of my comfort zone and for not caring what others would think and just doing it for ME.

Going forward, I would love to do another comp and see what I could do when I'm healthier/know exactly what to expect. I would LOOOVE to do one without needing to travel but I won't get my hopes up for that.

I'm currently trying to decide if I want to find a 1 on 1 coach. I loved having a coach for oly. But man powerlifting coaches are pricey, and I'd really love to work with a woman. If anyone has recs, I'm all ears! For now I'm going to start a cycle of GZCLP (my fav program) and just keep on doing what I love, going to the gym to train <3"

Neutral,"Alternatives for someone who loves heavy lifting but body feels too stressed  I did CrossFit for along time and loved it until I realized I needed a break. During the pandemic, I didn’t go to gym at all and returned to the gym and just did heavy lifting. I was following Meg Squats programming. I loved it. I was so happy in the gym and felt awesome. I am almost back to my PRs, can do a pull-up again, etc.

But once I got back towards my old maxes, it feels like my body is way too stressed— not so much in a soreness way but more in a way where it feels like my body is “bracing” and not wanting to go to gym. Does this even make sense? This same feeling happened to me towards the end of my CrossFit time as well. Like my body felt traumatized in a way and not wanting to go. And my body just felt heavy and sluggish. (Also my maxes really aren’t so high especially for my weight)

I want to change it up, although ideally still lifting weights just in a way that is gentler on my body. I love programming. I want to be told what to do. I want a plan that is smart. I don’t want to jump too much. I am open to anything that I can do solo in the gym. Could be a lighter lifting program, even could be a more aesthetic based program, but could also be some progressive running or other cardio program. Any suggestions?"

Neutral,"Hand Grip Size for Dumbbells  Hi folks, just looking for some opinions/thoughts on this.

I bought a set of dumbells recently (Hit Fitness  Neoprene Studio Dumbells)- they're a rainbow colour set. I already have an adjustable set with standard olympic barbell grip but found the range too narrow (goes from 5kg-7.5kg-10kg-12.5kg, etc), so this set starts from .5kg (lmao), then 1kg-10kg in steps of one kg, which is perfect, and all my weight gaps for various exercises are filled and I can progress more linearly now.

Except! The grip diameter increases on the dumbells the higher in weight you go, so I can comfortably wrap my hands around all the weights up to about 6kg, and thereafter my thumb and middle fingers don't touch. (I have average female hands, size 7) This has made me a bit wary because it tests my grip strength a lot more in an exercise when using the 7s, 8s, 9s, & 10s, and I don't have as secure a hold on the dumbells. (Scary when doing dumbbell chest press not to have a fully enclosed grip on the dumbbells!).

I see other dumbell sets like hex dumbells that have a uniformly wide hand grip, and I'm wondering if this is something to compromise on or not.

One reason I liked the Neoprene ones is because they are compact in length (which is useful for when doing alternating curls for example, they don't bang my hip). Another reason is that they are that bit cheaper than other dumbell sets.

I'm just trying to decide whether I should put up with the slightly uncomfortable/unsecure grip, or return them and opt for a set that has a uniform grip, but is also more expensive and are longer/bigger dumbells overall

Having written to this point, I think I probably shouldn't take the risk with the slacker grip at higher weights, but I'd still love to hear other women's experiences regarding hand grip size on weights, or if they have had this particular Hit Fitness set or something like it and can relate similarly.

Thanks all."
Neutral,"Can't squat due to mobiliy issues, I'd like to ask some advice!  Hello everyone!

For the first time in ages, I've decided to actually follow a workout plan (P.H.U.L.).

I have an issue though, I lack mobility in my hips and ankles. I've been working on them (doing dynamic stretches before workouts) and they seem getting better but still not good enough to allow me to squat deeply. I can't even reach a 90º angle. I actually lose my balance if I try to squat deeper.

So, instead of doing squats, I switched to the horizontal leg press, but I am not sure if this was the right choice. Should I do the lying leg press, the smith machine squat or the hack squat instead of the horizontal leg press? Should I even do these exercises instead of the squat? 

Another thing. When I try to do the squat motion while hanging on a pillar in the gym, but it makes the tendons that connect the quads to the hips hurt. The pain is gone after 5ish minutes. Is this caused by lacking mobility? Or is it something else?

What would you do if you were in this situation? I'm so desperate, that my 2022 goal is to squat normally.

Thank you for reading this far, hope you have a nice day!"
Disordered,"Locally owned gym vs franchise gym? Which would be more welcoming for a beginner?  Hi everyone, 

I am currently 143lbs and 5ft 5. I previously had a physical job where I could eat whatever I liked and still lost weight. I recently took more of a “sit-down” role at work which is a lot less physical than what I am used too, however my eating habits have stayed the same and I have gained some weight over the past few months. 

I love the idea of going to the gym but I struggle with my confidence and self esteem so I am terrified and trying to hype myself up to at least try. 

There are two gyms I am looking at, a franchise owned gym across the road from where I live and a locally owned gym a few miles away predominantly focussed on weights and strength training and body transformation courses.

Both gyms have similar classes, prices and opening times. They both offer personal training.

Disordered,"Reassessing my fitness goals: to cut or to recomp  Hey all! As the title states, I am reassessing my fitness goals and could use advice on how best to proceed to reach those goals. I am 28, cis F, 5'3'', and currently at 125 lbs.

I have lifted weights for YEARS, taking breaks here and there cause life, switching routines as I felt like it, without any real solid fitness goals besides 'get stronger'. I am also super active outside the gym as well. My body definitely showed results despite my loose goals, and I grew in arms/chest/back over time, but my legs always sorta lagged behind in terms of definition and size. I also have always hovered in weight between 110 and 115 lbs.

Most recently, like over the past 3 or 4 weeks, my legs have exploded (as have my PRs) and now I cannot fit into any of my jeans, which shouldn't be that big of a deal, but it bothers me. I don't think the 10 lb. weight gain bothers me as much as my measurements do. Hell, it might not even be the measurements! With my pants off, I think my thighs look pretty dope - its really just that my damn pants don't fit. While my legs are stronger and bigger they aren't necessarily anymore defined, which ultimately I think is what I want. 

So now, my goal is to continue to get stronger, and I would like more size in some areas, but I think I need to loose body fat in order to achieve a more defined look. I definitely hold most my body fat in my thighs. Plan on getting a DEXA scan of some sort to get a clearer idea of where I am before starting this next phase.

I have done some reading over the past couple days and feel like I have two options for moving forward: 1) enter a dedicated cut, loose some body fat %, then once that feels... right (?), move back into strength and size gains while keeping body fat off; or 2) try to recomp to do both at the same time. 

Which path would be best? Can anyone recommend weight lifting and cardio routines to achieve this? This is my current [workout routine](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout), more or less. I like the 4 days a week and hitting muscle groups twice a week. Can I keep this one while adding cardio to achieve my goal? Or should I be ditching the low reps (3-5)/high weight sets entirely? What is the ideal rep range I should be looking for for whichever recommended path? I am also considering [this plan](https://primevallabs.com/blogs/news/body-recomposition-guide) just cause it clear and concise (routine in the last third of the page).

After reading countless articles, I still don't know if LISS or HIIT is better. Everything I've read about recomp says its challenging and may not work. I would also be worried about loosing too much muscle mass in a cut. I haven't ever counted calories or done purposeful (ha) cardio, so both will be new adjustments.

I can't afford a personal trainer at the moment to assess this (nor can I afford more pants...). The idea of having to replace this part of my wardrobe is just... ugh. I have always struggled to find pants/jeans to fit over my thighs and not have a bucket waist - continuing down this path will make that even harder. Most of what I have is already tailored to fit better.

I average 3-4 workouts a week and also do some hybrid classes that include strength training. This has become a huge part of my life and I even just moved 5 minutes away from the studio.

However, in the past month or so my workouts seem to be so hard to push through and my post workout endorphins aren’t what they used to be. I mainly workout for mental health benefits. I still show up but I can’t “show out” like I used to it seems.
Sprinting in gear 4 used to be a breeze and now I can’t go as fast as I did and I just seem weaker. Class used to fly by but now it drags on as I just feel so uncomfortable and mad at myself that I can’t bring it like before.

I guess I’m chalking this up to being off in the summer (where I always gain a few pounds) and just moving this week (have been eating so much takeout). But with back to school around the corner I feel like it’s going to get even harder and I don’t want to quit on myself.

Anyone else ever go through this and have some good tips, tricks or motivation?"

The contest is for a Kennedy lift, basically the rack pull version of a Jefferson deadlift. You'll probably find that you can handle a lot of weight this way, which makes it super fun IMO (although it's definitely challenging on the grip). I can pull 3 plates from the ground but I did over 4 plates in my contest entry.

Disordered,"Do I need another recovery week or deload week after dealing with life stress?  I’ve been training about 4-5 days per week for 9 weeks straight. Each workout is roughly an hour. For roughly three of those week I was also returning to the gym for around 45 minutes to do cardio as well. I also sometimes ice skate and occasionally snowboard and do gymnastics.

After nine weeks, I felt like I was overreaching. I was super tired, demotivated and had occasional odd twinges that felt like they could be come injuries. I decided to listen to my body and take a week off. 

The problem is that this past week I’ve also dealt with two major stressors. First, when I stopped training, my period came early. There was a lot of heavy bleeding in the first two days which knocked me sideways. I’ve been diagnosed with endo previously but a good diet and exercise had previously managed this. I think suddenly stopping training might have something to do with it coming on like that. It totally wiped me out.

I’ve also been dealing with a bereavement and my mom came to stay with me for a week. Grieving myself and dealing with her grief has taken a huge emotional toll this week, as well as general family drama, and the stress of taking her around etc. 

Instead of getting a week to eat healthy and sleep more, I’ve been eating like shit and sleeping less. 

Tomorrow I would have started training again but I actually feel worse than before. I don’t want to take two weeks off in a row, but I also don’t know what to do. Does anyone have any advice? Period is over but all the stress of my so called recovery week has me confused.

Neutral,"How to train your calves most effectively  Calves are probably not the number 1 priority muscle to train for many people. However, training your calves is still important for an overall balanced physique, and it also helps with performance inside and outside the gym. 

That's why I thought it might be worth making a post about calf training, outlining which exercises I deem best and how you can incorporate these exercises into your weightlifting sessions (if you don't train calves already).

TLDR at the end of the post :)

# Anatomy of the Calves

But before I do so, let’s first have a look at the anatomy of the calves.

The calves actually consists of two different muscles: the gastrocnemius muscle, or gastroc for short, and the soleus muscle.

The gastroc has two heads - the medial or inner head, and the lateral or outer head. The gastroc attaches to the femor and through the achilles tendon to the heel bone. As such, the gastroc crosses two joints, namely the knee and the ankle. And because of its biarticular nature, the gastroc has two functions. The primary function of the gastroc is plantar flexion, meaning to point your toes down. But because the gastroc also crosses the knee joint, its other function is knee flexion, or bending the knee. As a result, the gastroc is also active during squats and leg curls, for example, or any other exercise where you bend your knees. However, the gastroc activation from these exercises is small, which is why you should still train your calves separately.

(As a side note, if you want to remove the gastroc from the equation when doing leg curls, simply extend your foot as if you were walking on your toes. Because the gastroc is now shortened at the ankle, its capacity to further shorten and bend the knee is limited.)

The other calf muscle is the soleus. The soleus muscle sits underneath the gastroc and is actually the bigger muscle of the two. It has only one head, which is attached to the tibia just below the knee joint, and it attaches to the heel bone via the achilles tendon. Thus, the soleus only crosses one joint, the ankle. Consequently, the sole function of the soleus muscle is plantar flexion, and it has no action at the knee at all.

# Best Calf Exercises

Knowing about the anatomy and the function of these two muscles, we can infer which exercise is the best for training the calves: Heel raises. Or more commonly called, calf raises.

In fact, calf raises and their variations are the single most effective exercise for growing your calves. And although both the gastroc and the soleus are active during any calf raise variation, we can place a greater emphasis on either of the two by varying the knee angle.

To put greater emphasis on the gastroc, any *standing* calf raise variation with fully extended, straight knees will do. If your gym has it, then I would recommend using the calf raise machine. However, many gyms (including mine) don’t have this piece of equipment. In that case, you can also do straight-legged calf raises on the leg press. Alternatively, you can also do them with the smith machine or with free weights.

In contrast, calf raises with your *knees bent at a 90 deg* angle target the soleus muscle really well. That’s because the bent knees already shorten the gastroc to some extent, thereby limiting how much further it can contract. Basically, doing calf raises in a seated position more or less disables the gastroc, which means that the soleus has to work harder. Again, if your gym has a dedicated seated calf raise machine, I would use it. But if it doesn’t, sitting on a bench and putting some weight plates or dumbbells on your legs works just as fine.

# Technique Tips & Common Mistakes

And while these two exercises, the standing calf raises and the seated calf raises, seem fairly easy, there are some things you need to consider for optimal muscle growth.

When setting up for either of these calf raise variations, you want to place your feet on an elevated platform. The calf raise machines already have such a platform built into them. But if you don’t have access to those machines, you can stand on a stack of weight plates or an aerobic stepper. Doing the calf raises on an elevated platform allows you to go through a full range of motion: You can fully contract your calves at the top, and you can also get into a good stretch at the bottom of the movement.

So once you have your elevated platform and your weights ready, step onto the platform such that the balls of your feet are on the weights stack or the stepper, and the heels are suspended in the air. Personally, I place my feet parallel to each other with my toes pointing straight ahead. But depending on your anatomy, you might want to choose a slightly different foot position.

Because contrary to popular belief, foot positioning doesn’t play a role for calf growth. Some early research suggested that internally rotating your leg (toes pointing inwards) would target the outer head of the gastroc more, while external rotation (toes pointing out) would put greater emphasis on the inner head of the gastroc. However, more recent studies failed to reproduce these findings. Meaning that it probably doesn’t matter at all whether you have your toes pointing inwards, outwards, or straight ahead. And it makes sense, because internal or external rotation mostly comes from your hips. And since neither the gastroc nor the soleus cross the hip joint, rotation in the hip shouldn’t influence the biomechanics of the calf muscles. Therefore, place your feet however feels most comfortable to you.

So once you are on the platform and found your ideal foot positioning, you can begin with the exercise itself:

* Squeeze your calves and push through the balls of your feet to raise your heels.
* At the top, I recommend holding the contraction for a second or two before reversing the movement.
* Especially on the negative, i.e. the lowering of your heels, you should control the movement. 
* How far you can lower your heels depends on your overall ankle mobility, so stop once you feel a good stretch in your calves.
* Once you’re in that bottom position, it’s important to pause for 1-2 seconds before raising your heels up again. Because of something called the stretch-reflex, if you don’t pause in the bottom position, the tension stored in your achilles tendon would propel you back up. Meaning that your tendons would do the work and not your muscles. But by shortly pausing at the bottom, the force in your tendons has time to “dissipate”, and your muscles will do the lifting.

# Calves Training Plan (Example)

Now that you know which exercises are best for training your calves and how to do them with good technique, how should you incorporate calf exercises into your workout routine?

If you haven’t already, I would train calves at the end of each leg day, ideally 1-2x per week.

For example, you could do seated calf raises on your first leg day, and single-leg standing calf raises on your second leg day. Personally, I like to include single-leg variations into my own training to prevent asymmetries and imbalances. But if you prefer a regular standing calf raise, that’s fine as well.

Because the soleus and gastroc have a very large proportion of type 1 (or slow twitch) fibres, your calves aren’t that easy to fatigue. This is why they profit from higher rep ranges.

For example, you could do 3 sets of 12-20 reps of seated calf raises on your first leg day. And on your second leg day, you could do 2 sets of 10-15 reps per leg of single-leg standing calf raises.

No matter your exercise selection and chosen rep range, always make sure to put technique first and go through a full range of motion. A bit of cheating towards the end of the set is okay if it helps you squeeze out some additional reps. But the majority of your reps should be done with good form and in a controlled manner.

Once you are confident with your technique, it’s time to focus on intensity and progressive overload. Since the calves are a relatively small muscle group and are able to recover quite quickly, I would train to failure, or at least very close to failure, on each set. Personally, I find it easiest to go all the way to failure on each set, especially because I’m doing only 2-3 sets for the calves (\*per workout) anyway. But if you want to leave one or two reps in the tank, then that’s fine as well. I further recommend taking between one and two minutes of rest between sets, so your calves have time to recover. And if you find it’s becoming too easy, you can add more reps or more weight over time, in order to keep it sufficiently challenging.

# TLDR

* The calves consist of two muscles, the gastrocnemius and the soleus muscle. The primary function of these two muscles is to raise your heel up in the air. 
* Therefore, the best exercises for the calves are heel raises, also called calf raises. To target both the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle, you should do both standing and seated calf raises. 
* I recommend training calves 1-2x per week, at the end of your leg day. 
* The calves profit from higher rep ranges (10+ reps), and you can train them to failure on every set. I recommend 1-2min of rest between sets.

Disordered,"GZCLP Program Review and Would love to hear from 'seasonal' lifters  **TLDR;** GZCLP going really well for a lifting novice cardio junkie. Looking to take a break from the program to run and swim more but want to do it in a smart way.

&#x200B;

**About me:**   I am a 35F, 5'8"" and have been around 125 lbs for most of my adult life. My primary loves are mid-distance running, swimming and running stairs. I put up with cycling so that I can compete in 1-2 triathlons a year. I am a data scientist and therefore spend much of my day sitting (I try to do walking meetings when I can). I have wanted to get into lifting for a few years and failed to stick to it for more than 1 month. This is primarily due to not following a program and trying to squeeze too much into 1 day (for example, doing 30 minutes of cardio before lifting. doing all 4 big lifts in one day)

**Goals:** I am interested in improving my bone health and mobility as I age. I'd like to be a more well-rounded athlete and I know that having more muscle in my legs and arms will ultimately help improve my running and swimming paces respectively.

**What I did:** I followed the GZCLP (thank goodness for that infographic on saynotobroscience ([https://saynotobroscience.com/gzclp-infographic/](https://saynotobroscience.com/gzclp-infographic/)). It really helped me not be so intimidated/confused by the program. I ran the program M/W/F. Typically on these days I also try to walk for 50-60 minutes and/or do a very light 20 minute job right after my lifts (using what's left in the tank according to my trainer. I loved this advice as it helped me still get in my 12k steps for the day)

* Workout 1: Heavy 5x3 Squat, Lighter 3x10 Bench, Accessories: Pull-ups, Hollow Holds, Bulg Split Squats
* Workout 2: heavy 5x3 Deadlift, Lighter 3x10 OHP, Accessories: Push-ups, Triceps Ext, Single leg weighted bridge
* Workout 3: Heavy 5x3 Bench, Lighter 3x10 Squat, Accessories: Pull-ups, Hollow Holds, Bulg Split Squats
* Workout 4: Heavy 5x3 OHP, Lighter 3x10 Deadlift, Accessories: Push-ups, Triceps Ext, Single leg weighted bridge

On the other days of the week, I typically fit in 2 long swims and 1 longish (6 mile) run or an hour of stairs

**Mental Blocks I had to overcome:** I missed doing cardio every day, I really did. I decided to treat this as a 'break' from endurance training. It wasn't a complete break obviously, but significantly less mileage. And I timed this to be in the summer when it is hot and I don't love to run anyway. It also really helped me to track my lifts in Excel so that I wouldn't forget what weight I was at. DOMS subsided after the first 2 weeks, thank goodness, so that I could still do other activities on days when I wasn't lifting

**Results:** I took one week off for vacation and when i came back I did 1 workout of each where I repeated my last weight. Other than that I progressed pretty well

* Weight: 125 lbs > 130 lbs. I feel good about the weight gain and am seeing visible definition in my upper body
* T1 5x3
   * Squat 65 lbs > 90 lbs
   * Bench: 80 lbs > 100 lbs
   * Deadlift: 95 lbs > 140 lbs
   * OHP: 45 lbs > 70 lbs (so happy with this)
* T2 3x 10
   * Squat: 50 lbs > 80 lbs
   * Bench: 70 lbs > 90 lbs (starting to stall out here so I might invest in microplates)
   * Deadlift: 65 lbs > 100 lbs
   * OHP: 30 lbs > 60 lbs
* T3
   * Pushups and pull-ups holding steady at 6 reps and 10 reps respectively. I found that my upper body was too worn out from my big lifts to increase reps on these...  **EDIT:** I mixed up push-ups and pull-ups :) I generally do 6-7 pull-ups and 10 push-ups

**Nutrition:** I intuitively ate with the intention to slowly bulk and its been just fine. I think it sort of happened on its own. I cut out almost 4 hours of cardio a week and was naturally much hungrier from lifting. At first I was not eating enough and could tell from some mild insomnia. So I intentionally consumed about 300 extra cals right before bed. I also swapped out my nightly cereal for a protein shake and made some other substitutes for additional protein.

**What's next and i why did I ask about seasonal lifters?** Come September the weather will be beautiful and I miss high-volume running. I am wondering if 3-4 months is too soon to 'cycle off' and what the best interim low volume strength routine would be so that I can return to lifting in November without losing everything. My ideal week would consist of 3-4 runs, 2 swims and maybe 1 day of stairs. I am torn between trying to dedicate 1 day a week to lifting (all 4 lifts but with lower weight, just to keep it in my routine) or just doing 3 sets of bodyweight stuff through the day every day (push-ups, pull-ups and some form of unilateral squats). If you do lifting seasonally to accommodate other loves, what does that look like for you? What is the smartest way to do it?"

Disordered,"Rapid loss of running fitness - what happened, and what do I do?  For a little bit of background: I started running in February this year, with the goal of running a 5k straight through. I had never enjoyed running before or really been able to do it at all, but within just a few weeks of doing couch to 5k I was in love with it. I was running almost every day, making pretty steady progress, and I ran my first full 5k at the end of March. 

After that I started training for 10k, continuing to run every day and running my first 10k at the end of May. I continued to run for the first 2 weeks of June, doing another 10k and some speed workouts. Then, I took a somewhat unintentional break from running for the second half of June because I was really busy with school, finals, work, etc.

When I came back to running at the start of July, I found that I had lost almost all of my running fitness. I had to push really hard to just run a mile, and could barely run more than 15 straight minutes when just two weeks prior I was easily running 10ks. 

There were no significant changes to my diet or other routines during my break from running, and I was still staying active, walking between 15k-20k steps a day and doing light strength training a few days a week. No injuries, nothing.

Since then I've been trying to gain my fitness back, but nothing is working. Every time I run I hit the same wall around the 15 minute mark and can't really push past it no matter how hard I try. It's just a running problem - I'm lifting consistently, biking better than ever before, rollerskating a ton. I really don't understand what's going on. I'm still relatively new to running, but it seems wrong that I could lose almost 6 months of progress in two weeks, and not be able to recover it at all. 

Does anyone have any advice or knowledge on what I can do to get my running fitness back? I really want to start training for a half marathon in the coming months but need to get back into running shape before that can happen!"
Neutral,"Fitness blender vs Team Body Project  Hi all! I know these have been discussed before but I'm hoping to get some more insight.

I'm 26F, not very active or fit, I had a gym membership but recently cancelled it because I never liked going and it was ruining the fun of exercise for me. I decided to give home workouts more of a try, doing a mix of yoga, Ring Fit, and various YouTube routines. 

For a while, I've been doing team body project. I did all the free videos in their trainer class and really enjoyed it. A lot of times, I'll start a video but give up before the end, but never did that with these. They're just the right pace for me and I like having the direction of the routines. 

However I was doing research before wanting to spend the $140 for the full year (which honestly is almost how much I was spending for my gym membership) and found people recommending Fitness Blender. I saw many people say they prefer FB to TBP, and I admit that they seem much more affordable. However I am unsure about them, they have a ton of videos but a less clear sense of direction for good progression. I know they have routines to buy but I don't like that I can't try them before buying it, even if they're fairly cheap. 

I guess I'm looking for insight on if it makes sense to just spend the $140 or if I should wait and give FB a more fair shake. Has anyone had good experiences with either? Is FB okay for people who are less active? Thanks everyone!"
Neutral,"Why do I feel certain muscles “working” better at a lower weight? Will this limit growth?  Hi!

I’ve been lifting on and off for a few years. Lately I’ve been focused on glute hypertrophy. Im noticing that when I do lower weight, I feel my glutes being “recruited” more (more sensation/fatigue in the muscles). When I up the weight, I feel like my quads and hamstrings get pumped and my glutes go numb/absent. It doesn’t make any sense to me. 

What should I do? My main goal is glute growth, because I’ve noticed they have weakened a lot due to my office job. 

Right now this is what I’m trying: 

1. Hip Thrust
2. RDL
3. Leg press

Neutral,"How to make working put enjoyable?  All my life I've been in a hot n cold relationship with working out. At some point I would be crazy about it and working out like crazy and then there are times when I resent it and can't get myself to one squat (those times are really intense for the last year/year and a half). I wanna be that girl who loves working put and finds it as a way to vent and let go of stress. Whenever I see a girl running or working out I'm like ""OMG I wanna be her"" and I do get motivated but lately it just doesn't stick with me. I know you're gonna say that I don't have to force myself into something that maybe just isn't me but I really wanna at least try to be that girl. So to all you people who have made working out your passion - how did you do it? Do I have to work out at the gym or could it be home workouts and some walks? Any advice is welcome and no hate please :)

Edit: the title should say working OUT 😆

Edit 2: As the mod suggested I will be putting more info. My goals are weightloss but also being fit and that ""workout type"" of girl, like I can just get my mind and go do a workout just cause I enjoy it. In the past I've trained volleyball and boxing, did some circular training and went to the gym for a few months but I've never trained anything for so long (just being consistent, without distractions) to actually make working out a routine for me."
Neutral,"I want to build strength/muscle but HATE weight lifting.  Hi all, apologies if this has been posted before but I wanted to hear some opinions. I started running in my early 20s after having my second child and fell in love with it. I wasn’t super active in my teen years but quickly built the habit and fell in love with any sort of cardio exercise. Now that I am in my 30s, I still LOVE cardio. Running, cycling, any type of machine at the gym- I’m totally there for it. I like being all sweaty, feeling my heart rate increase and the “high” you get from intense cardio.

However, despite my love for it I have gained some weight the last 5 years. I am not overweight but I’m unhappy with the composition of my body. Upon speaking with my doctor, they suggested strength training to build more muscle. I knew in my heart that was the answer but still sighed because well, I HATE IT. I have tried various strength training routines and programs over the years: the latest being “thinner leaner stronger”. I absolutely hate the routines. It feels boring to me to stand there just doing reps and counting. I did start to see minor improvements in my arms after about 8 weeks but it wasn’t enough to continue to motivate me through what I perceive to be a mind numbing workout. And though it did feel like I was exerting myself it’s not the same feeling I get with cardio. 

Sorry this is long. I guess I’d like to hear from other women who have had a similar experience? Did you eventually find a form of strength training you liked? What was it? How long until you saw results with body recomp? 

Tl;DR: I LOVE cardio, hate weight lifting but am unhappy with my body composition. Not overweight but looking to build muscle. Please help?"

Neutral,"Advice? Crush the strength portion, struggle with the run  Service member here. I’ve crushed the strength portion on every PT test I’ve taken, but the 1.5 mile run is a huge struggle. I had a torn ligament in my ankle in basic that went untreated for months. I’ve absolutely hated running since then, but I’m still required to as a part of my test. Obviously running now and then is good training, but can I sufficiently improve my cardio endurance through other means? I picked up kickboxing a few months ago and LOVE it, but is that enough (with a few runs thrown in here and there) to build up that endurance and make the 1.5 mile less sucky?

Other suggestions/ advice outside of kickboxing are welcome!"
Neutral,"How are workout routines different now than in the past for women?  I will preface by saying I'm 23 and I have noticed that in the past 7 years or so weight lifting for women has become increasingly popular! I really don't remember hearing any woman in in the early 2010s lifting weights as a form of working out, but I have no recollection of how it was before that.

I am asking this out of pure curiosity. Especially for women who have been through multiple decades of ""trending"" body shapes and standards. How did women work out in the 80s/90s/2000s?"
Disordered,"Is glute or thigh dominance a real thing? Looking to make thigh gains to look more curvy & tweak current program for that.  I’ve been on a slower lifting journey focusing on a body recomp to kick things off for a year now. Over a year with my program (1 day is upper body 2 day is lower and I try to do 2 lower body 1 upper per week) has given me good results. I have gone down a clothing size, I don’t have confidence yet because my anxiety and self doubt gets the best of me but I’m trying to fight back and be more disciplined. 

I’ve happily made gradual gains on my shoulders, glutes and back and lost some fat too without even incorporating cardio or HIIT - I have Insulin resistant PCOS so I have learned over the years to be slow, steady and gentle with my progress but also push myself to get stronger. 

While my glutes have grown my thighs haven’t gotten much growth. I’ve seen some people talk about some are more glute or quad dominant than others — and I guess following that idea, I am glute dominant. I would like to grow my quads and hopefully have a more feminine figure - kind of like a strong warrior lady. Muscle & curves and enough squish to keep me kind of warm. 

If anyone has tips on effective exercises for quad growth feel free to let me know and I can tweak my program. I don’t do squats or deadlifts because of a lower back concern - but have incorporated trap bar RDLs and Bulgarian Split Squats for glutes and have seen good results. 

Quads I usually use the leg extension machine, lunges, and leg press machine. 

Current leg day : Glute bias Bulgarian split squats, Leg Press, Quad extension machine, Hip Thrust, backwards lunges (15 / leg) ,Trap Bar RDL, Glute Medius Kickback, Calf Raises. - warmup set is 10-12 reps, actual is 6-8. 

If you suggest I should split leg day into different area days (like glutes & hams for 1 , quads & calves for 2 - I can do some tweaking that way. 

Thank you !"
Neutral,"Squats - transitioning to barbell / general help?!  Hello, I'm a fairly heavy (200lb/5'8"") lifter who's been trying to hit the gym really regularly doing Casey Johnson's amazing lift-off programme. I've been going since April and have really found my flow now, and I'm no longer hugely anxious about how I look for being a fat girl/ trying things that look really scary. It's fucking awesome. 

&#x200B;

Everything else has been going really well, bench press, rows, etc, but my squats are taking FOREVER to improve. I have a theory that this is because I'm quite a heavy girl, and I also have disproportionately long legs for my height (I ride a bike that's for a taller person, etc). I'm kind of surprised because I have incredibly mobile hips and plenty of cycling/yoga/pilates strength in my glutes, was quite humbling to see how rubbish I was! 

&#x200B;

So, I've been consistently squatting 20kg/45lbs (or 2x22lbs)  without too much trouble (the weight of a standard plain barbell) and thought it might be time to challenge myself and try the ultimate scary thing, squatting with a dumbell.   


Today I tried it out with a bare bar, and while I unracked it fine and stepped back fine, I felt so much more unsteady, was actually quite scary. I didn't go very low at all and stopped pretty much after 3 reps, and went back to sweating my ass off doing squats with my dumbbells. What should I do?   


Smith machine? Mobility drills? Just keep on with the dumbbells until I build up my strength? Use a broom at home?

(Please note, bringing a pal to help me isn't really very realistic at this stage, and while I have much more confidence, asking other gymfolks/gym staff to help would cause me so much anxiety)"
Disordered,"Weight training for powerlifting and heavy events at highland games  I am super interested in getting involved with powerlifting with the aim of competing in the heavy events at local highland games (I live in rural Scotland so they are pretty common) in 2023/2024. I have zero experience doing any kind of lifting however have always been strong and keen to develop this.  I am finding it difficult though to know where to start. From what I can gather powerlifting and also general strongman/woman type training is best for what I am interested in competing in however everything I am finding online seems to be either aimed at men and contains a lot of toxic mindsets around masculinity and isn't very welcoming to women or more bodybuilding type stuff that isn't really what I am looking for. I am not bothered so much about physique and more just building strength.

I was wondering if anyone had any powerlifting/strongwomen content/books/sites they would recommend? I am looking for anything really from advice on good form to just inspirational folks to follow. Like I said I live in the middle of no where and there are very few (if any) women locally who seem to be lifting heavy stuff for fun so would appreciate some recommendations of where to start and trustworthy content.

Lastly I don’t intend to do much in the actual gym atm as cash is short however have plenty of good quality equipment and weights at home that belong to my partner to get started with. Will be great for starting deadlifts and rep practice I reckon. I will travel to a gym in the first few months though to get advice from a trainer but want to check its the right aport for me before investing much money."
Disordered,"New research concludes that it doesn't matter if you spread your physical activity throughout the week or concentrate it within a couple of days  An article published last month in JAMA Internal Medicine (a leading peer-reviewed US medical journal) analyzed the self-reported physical activity of over 350,000 adults. They looked for differences in death rates based on whether participants spread their physical activity out over 3 or more weekly sessions or concentrated it into just 1 or 2 sessions. They found no significant difference in mortality between the groups. (I'll link to the study report is in the comments.)

So, don't beat yourself up if a daily (or near-daily) workout schedule isn't a good fit for you! Maybe it's too hard to fit in a workout on the weekdays due to your job or other obligations. No problem; do your workouts on the weekends. Maybe you've had a hectic week and missed a couple of workouts that you'd planned. No problem; you might consider making your next workout a tad longer than usual."

Neutral,"Help me with my squat form  Hey all! I've been going to the gym for ~2 years now, and continue to struggle with barbell-squatting. My form has always been bad and so I'm not able to progress much at all.

I read somewhere that doing goblets well would be the best way to improve form when struggling with the barbell. So I practiced my form and got stronger doing goblet squats, which was very doable. But it doesn't seem to have helped at all, and I'm very demotivated.

The problem it seems to me is I lean forward to much, and try to throw my arms/elbows out. It's really hard for me to not do this, and when I don't I fall (I'm not sure if I lose balance, or am not strong enough).

(2) desperatly trying to keep my arms normal/upper body upright and falling
(3) no weight squat - looks fine to me (except I'm unable to do it at all with my arms at my side)

I've tested my ankle/hip mobility - those seem to not be an issue. Putting my heels up with weights doesn't seem to help at all.

Neutral,"Alternating Running and Weight Training Days  Hey all, I need some help creating a schedule/program that includes both running and weight training. After searching the sub/doing internet research, the most common advice seems to be to do both my run and weight train on one day so that I can take a “complete” rest day the next. I’ve been trying to implement this for the past couple months and failing badly. I either end up skipping one of the workouts or just doing neither, and the lack of consistency has been translating into a lack of progress. 

My adhd brain needs consistency in the time of day I work out and I need to work out almost daily (not necessarily a tough workout, could be a easy restorative yoga day or a walk) in order to keep consistent and stick with any program. So I’ve been considering alternating running and weight training days, but I’m not sure how that would work. My plan is to run 2-3x a week and weight train 2-3x a week so that could mean as few as 1 active rest days a week, which I’m not sure is adequate. Currently, I’m working out at a slightly lower  frequency (3-5 days a week) and its usually either just running or just weight training every week, not both.

Neutral,"Doctor told me to stop lifting heavy — feeling discouraged  Hi everyone,

I’ve been weightlifting for about 4-5 years now, and with a lot of consistency in the past year. It has lifted my mood, given me a routine to stick to, and really improved my health and my self confidence. I’ve been able to lift heavier and heavier, and I always looked forward to hitting PRs. I recently had an annual physical with a new doctor, who – thank God — actually took the time to listen to my concerns and test me for symptoms.

I’ve had some neurological issues for years now, and my doctor warned me against lifting too heavy and suggested switching up my routine.

I’ve been feeling really discouraged and disappointed. I want to continue lifting and lifting heavy, because I love the mental rush it gives me, and I loved challenging myself to lift heavier and heavier. I don't want to lose my gains either, though I suppose that's not possible to an extent.  I guess I could just increase my reps, but I want to find something that challenges me mentally and physically in the same way that lifting heavy does.

How have you switched up your routines to challenge yourself in new ways? And how have you coped with not being able to do what you want to do?

After reading several articles similar to this one https://www.verywellfit.com/beginners-guide-to-sets-repetitions-and-rest-intervals-3498619 I feel confused about the recommended sets and reps for strength vs hypertrophy training.

The explanation makes sense that to train for strength you have to lift heavier for fewer reps, and for the “muscular” look you use a bit less weight and increase the reps. It implies that you can gain strength without maximum gain in muscle size. However...I have it in my head the “crossfit look” and big muscles of power lifters when I think of hypertrophy, and I was under the impression that they lift very heavy?

Also, the article indicates that to train for muscle endurance, you would need to increase the reps even more while using lighter weights. For me I think of BodyPump classes as endurance training and you definitely don’t get big from BodyPump.

What am I missing here? I’m confused because it sounds like you don’t get big by lifting very heavy at low reps as well as lifting light weight at high reps, but if you lift something around 3 sets of 10 reps then you get big?

Are there any good picture examples of what a woman can achieve through each type of training so I can see if I need to change up my routine to meet my goals?"

Estimated myself to be 22-25% body fat, actual was 18.3% (the lady giving me results said 18.2% so I'm not sure if the extra .1% is rounded up from the .003lb of visceral fat but the report I received said 18.3%). Weighed in at 139lbs during the test but this was a wet weight, I am lower in the evening (~136lbs) before I eat for the day.

Estimated I burned 1750cal at rest, actual was 2287 (!!!!). This makes a lot of sense given my consistent progress while overeating on the weekends fairly often. 

I have another competition 9/24 and scheduled a DEXA scan and RMR for a couple days prior. I have done a bunch of metabolism blood tests through Everlywell to check my free testosterone since I _think_ I was able to successfully boost it through natural means, but each one did not have enough blood sampled to complete the test. Hopefully I can get my fingers to bleed more because I am oh-so curious what the numbers are. I was at 14.9pg/mL free T back in December. In theory you would need 100g of bull testicles to replicate the amount of test an adult male creates so taking 1.2g daily would only be a slight boost.

My protocol:

# supps

* opti-women multivitamin (2x capsules daily)
* fish oil (1000mg daily)
* creatine (5g+ daily)
* BCAAs (5g - 20g daily)
* tukesterone (500mg twice daily - started 11/23/21)
* bull testicles lmao (1200mg daily - started 5/25/22)
* d-aspartic acid (2000mg daily - started 5/27/22)

# diet

* calories in, calories out - weigh errythang, read nutrition facts and look for errors like says 0cals but also claims to have protein and carbs - go off macro values (4cal per g carb and protein, 9cal per g of fat)
* typically in a 500-1000cal+ deficit M-F then eat to maintenance or a lil over on the weekend
* prioritize protein, then fiber + micros and from fruit + veg
* fill in the rest of calories with stuff that makes me feel like i'm cheating on my diet
* shrimp, chicken breast, broccoli, cherries and berries are staples but i go through phases
* getting ~250g protein most days but it's not necessary - law of thermodynamics would mean i put out more energy breaking down protein so there's some potential minmaxing going on here but i'm not relying on it lol
* intermittent fast - sometimes for 24+ hours - but it's naturally how i eat (large meal / snacks at night, no breakfast or lunch) - doubt that i'm burning more fat in a fasted state but who knows - this is the only reason why i take BCAAs daily (prevent my body from eating lean mass for fuel) but i also drink black coffee, ACV, etc. that'll trigger an insulin response so likely not  t r u l y  fasted but w/e i enjoy it

# exercise 

* i don't sit until evening if i don't have to - don't have back pain like i used to several years ago
* 50lb weighted vest doing stairs at a lvl 9 - 10 for 35m if i do cardio at the gym, otherwise it's all weights/machines _if_ i go to the gym (big if lol, been once since August 2021)
* in a cut i'll do 25k - 35k steps on weekdays while working - probably have an addiction to my treadmill desk - but otherwise averaging over 15k a day, if i didn't i wouldn't be able to eat 2000cal+ and still lose weight
* hypertrophy training - go to failure unless injury risk - rule of 8 (if i can do more than 4 sets of 8 reps i up the weight (including if the last set or two i only hit 8 reps but first ones are 10+)) my body needs to know i'm struggling to move some shit and it better grow or else
* dance dance revolution - basically HIIT? idk adds a lil cal burn"
Disordered,"How do you deal with people who rush you at the gym?  I go to a commercial gym at around 9-10AM five to six days a week. Today I had to go a little closer to 10 although I intended to go at 8:30 as my gym buddy slept in and we carpool together.

When I got there, it was much more crowded than usual, and I had to wait to use some machines, although I was already in a rush to get in and out. After switching up my routine to fit what equipment was available, A smith machine opened up, (It’s PF), and I quickly headed over to do hip thrusts. These take me a little more time than usual to set up because I can never find the exact placemat the bench should be, but I never take more than 15-20 mins to finish all of my sets and warming up as well.

This older guy came over to me and we exchanged a little bit of banter, as I was just trying to be polite and he seemed nice. He was using the smith machine next to me, and according to my gym buddy, during my sets he would stop what he was doing and watch me. My gym buddy came over to me to let me know he was watching me because it was starting to make him worry. When he came over, the older guy told him to stop talking to me and to go away, saying “sitting around and talking isn’t proper gym etiquette”. My gym buddy came over for maybe 30 seconds while I was resting in between sets. 

A couple other girls were waiting for me to finish which is fine, it was crowded, so I get it. But this dude would take time to stop using his machine, tell me to hurry up, and make the girls waiting uncomfortable. Overall I was nervous that he was going to yell at me again so I rushed through the rest of my sets, not taking any rests, and it just totally killed my workout.

My question is how do I deal with people like this and not let it effect my workout? This experience just totally ruined my day.

TLDR: older guy at the gym kept rushing me, which ruined my workout and my mood.

Edit: I had AirPods in, though I might invest in some over the ear headphones for when I’m in a “do not speak to me ever” mood"

I have no concrete measurable goal, sometimes I dream about doing a pull-up but I have too much on my plate to train hard atm. My bf is a dedicated lifter and has been tracking his lifts for years. He strongly suggests I track my lifts to improve my performance, but I think our motivations are different and I don't see what benefit I would get. I also sometimes have an unhealthy perspective with numbers/expectations, similar to how many women feel about the weighing scale but mine is more like 'if you can't run at x pace, what is even the point', hence my hesitation (dw I'm in therapy).

I am looking to be able to run faster and better. Since I’ve lived a sedentary life all my life, my best 2 mile time is 21 minutes. I started doing interval running sprint 1 minute then jog 1 minute with incline twice a week for about 2 months (I lift weights other days) now but I’m not sure if I’m doing it right. I don’t feel any increase in my stamina when I lift weights or when I run either. I always get so tired after cardio day too. I was exhausted, which makes me really not like to do cardio.

I'm supposed to go to the gym in a few hours and I'm wondering if I should just go get some tampons first. I'm not concerned about it leaking so much as just sliding out of place and the stem being painful, then having to go to the bathroom and fix it after each set. But if I use tampons then I will be worried about leaking...


I should mention that mine slides out of position pretty easily after an hour or two of movement anyway so I try to remain seated or keep myself very upright.

Disordered,"How do you progressively challenge yourself with weights?  Hello all. I’ve recently gotten back to weight-training mainly using dumbbells and kettlebells. I follow the ketogains prescribed workout A&B at home. I aim to do each exercise for the suggested 12 reps per set for a maximum of 4 sets with 2 min rest in between. I’m finding though with some exercises that the weight is not enough of a challenge in that I feel I can do more than the prescribed number of reps. For some exercises, the weight is definitely a challenge and feel that I can’t do anymore than the 12 reps. 

How do you progressively challenge yourself with your weights program? Do you end up staying at the same weight but do more reps until it burns or do you increase the weight for those exercises and stay at the prescribed number of reps? Are either a good strategy or does it depend on your goal? When I used to lift weights regularly it was over 20 years ago and some old school thinking were:

• The number of reps you do must cause a burning sensation or your muscles must be sore after your workout for it to be effective.

• If you want bulky muscles, focus on heavy weights and low number of reps but you still need to make sure the number of reps is enough to tire you that you can’t do anymore beyond that number.

• If you want more of the lean and toned look, you should use lighter weights with a high number of reps. I’m not sure what qualifies as a high number of reps anymore but I believe it was 15 reps but again, it must burn!

I doubt if any of the above are acceptable in this day and age and I’m hoping some of you current lifters could educate me on how to progressively challenge myself with weights without injuring myself? As far as making sure my form is right, I’ve made sure the last month was all about this but now I’m wondering how to progress from here and make sure I keep challenging myself. It won’t be an issue for me to buy heavier weights if needed and I believe I’ve got my protein down pat. My goal is lose fat and be a muscle lady lol. Like I don’t want a lean Pilates look but a look that says that chick lifts weighs if that makes sense. Thank you so much for reading this far. Looking forward to hearing from you."
Neutral,"How to transition to doing more yoga without losing muscle gains  A bit of background about myself - I’m in my late 20s and have been lifting heavy (4-5x a week, primarily for hypertrophy and bodybuilding type movements) for 7 years. I add in a bit of yoga and running here and there but I’m a lifter.

I got into yoga in 2020 and fell in love but also got into a period where my practice sort of dropped off. However I’ve also wanted to deepen my practice and be able to do more inversions and arm balances and such, but I know I cannot do something like a handstand without practicing pretty often.

That being said, I love lifting and cannot stop doing it entirely. I have only about 45-60 min to hit the gym about 5x a week. I also want to do cardio at least 1-2x a week (I used to do a short run after an upper body day).

I feel like I want to do too much but I know I wouldn’t be able to get where I want to with my flexibility and yoga unless I literally just do it more.

Does anyone have any advice for how a person like me can do this REALISTICALLY?  More context about me, I’m a 22 year old female living in Brooklyn, New york. I’m 5’5, 130 lbs, kinda long torso short legs but somewhat hourglass. Diabetes and obesity run in my family. I have NEVER had an athletic bone in my body. I grew up with asthma so i’ve always been pretty sedentary. I actually can’t run for more than two minutes without an asthma attack. I always stayed skinny because of my diet but i was “skinny fat” for lack of a better word. Collarbones and ribs showing, thigh gap, but squishy stomach with a little pot belly, squishy arms, some leg cellulite, very weak. 

Now that I’m an adult and I live with my boyfriend (who is pretty overweight) i’ve gained some relationship weight as well as what i’m guessing is “you’re an adult now” maturing bodyweight, but its all going to my stomach, and my legs are getting even more cellulite and I don’t like it lol. I stayed 105 lbs throughout high school and when I moved to NY a year and half ago I was 115 lbs and it seems I’ve gained 15-20 lbs in 8 months or so and it shows.  

I started going to the gym and lifting weights and doing HIIT with a personal trainer but i honestly found a lot of it to be too hard to do on my own. The brazilian split squats she had me doing made it almost impossible for me to even walk for up to like 5 days after. The hiit workouts were super brief and pretty boring (jumping jacks for 30 seconds, high kicks, etc) but i did like the hiit because it didn’t give me an asthma attack. If anyone has any recommendations for fun easy HIIT workouts i can follow at the gym or at home (limited space) without looking stupid I would LOVE THAT.

Idk i just felt discouraged :/ but i am biking to work 4 days a week now, and i walk 5-10 thousand steps a day because i’m a waitress in the city. But i’m really struggling with diet too. Working at a restaurant i mostly eat work food (korean), there’s rice EVERYWHERE which I try to avoid but there’s so much fried shit too. I literally never feel full. I always want to eat. I always take peoples leftovers, i can’t let things go to waste, its hard for me to not finish everything on my plate even if i’m feeling full. When i was working out i was focusing on eating a lot of protein which led to me always feeling bloated but still wanting more food?? Also living in new york it feels like the only food groups are tacos/mexican, halal, pizza, chinese, or deli sandwich. Grocery stores are so expensive here and the selection is trash and i basically live paycheck to paycheck. I’m always busy, I try to cook healthy on my days off but even then i eat SO MUCH.

So…. Can anyone relate??? What do you do? How do you work out? What do you eat? How did you shift gears and find a good routine? How do you resist temptation? How do you afford this shit ?????

Neutral,"How many pounds of muscle can a woman realistically gain?  I’ve been trying to not weigh myself and worry more about how I look/feel but I just accidentally saw my weight at the doctors office and was shocked to find that I was 20lbs heavier than I thought and 10lbs more than my previous highest weight. It can be hard for me to tell when I’m gaining weight due do my shape/body composition, but I definitely don’t think I look like I weigh 180lbs (I’m 5’5” and 25). 


However I’ve been working out consistently for the past 3 years (lots of hiit and bodyweight, 8-9 months of weights) and haven’t weighed myself for at least 2, and I know I’ve definitely put on some muscle. In the past 3 months I’ve started lifting heavier and my goal has been to ”get buff”, aka I want to put on as much muscle mass as possible. Maybe I’m just trying to rationalize the weight gain but it’s definitely not all fat as I look better at 180 than I did at 170 without exercise.

I have a problem with Nautilus glute drive and I've been trying many times for the past few days to position myself properly there, but I think I'm too short for it. When I lie down on it and put the belt on my hip bones, I can barely hold the handles. If I go down to grasp the handles, the belt is in a wrong position and it hurts.

When I try to exercise in these positions, I feel it all in my front thighs in a very painful way + the belt really hurts my insides if positioned wrong. Something just doesn't feel right. :D  


I'm 168cm tall / 5'6 and I have a long upper body with short legs. I'm definitely shorter than men around me and I suppose the machine is made for their size. Any tips on what to do in this situation? Maybe ditch the machine and do normal hip thrusts on a bench? Or maybe there is some setting to adjust that I don't know about?  


\+ If you guys have any good YT channel reccommendations or sources, I'd be thankful for links. I like short videos where a person shows how a machine works, but without unnecessary talking and intros. I'm bad at watching long vids and reading long theoretical essays heh."

Neutral,"I made it! I walked 100k in 24 hours  Proof: https://imgur.com/gallery/vppfq1R 
A while ago i was bored on my daily walks and thought “Has everyone ever walked 100k steps in 24 hours?”, So I searched “100” and “100k” in this subreddit and once i found out that it is possible for someone whos not an ultra runner to do it, i decided to do it. I start at 5 am, ended it at 23:40 pm or something.

So this was a bit impulsive. On friday I decided to do it on sunday, but i was still a bit tired so i did it on monday (yesterday)! I didnt plan out routes or anything. People say i should train for this but before this, im already used to walking and walk 20-35k steps a day, and i have been to 15+ miles hike, and i also do a lot of leg related stuffs like peloton or elliptical.
Here is how it goes for me:

10-20k : Its still easy, nothing special

30k: still good but i was getting a bit upset, because it was hot

40k: because i didnt plan out route, i spent my time wondering around following google map. Still not that tough but my mood was pretty ruined because i got lost lol 

50k-60k: Not sure why, but i got super mad at this range. I feel like i wanna kick everyones ass

70k-80k: THE. WORST. I was about to cry so bad. I was dead tired and also sad because i thought none of my friends checked on me.  Then I open instagram and see one of my best friends dmed me a lot of “are you crazy?” “are you okay?“ “are you safe?” stuffs and my mood went from -10/10 to 5/10. Shes the only one that checked on me.  

Also, i dont reccomend you ladies to do this, but around 9/10 pm, a dude was also running and he walked by my side and tried to talk to me. Normally this would be creepy af but i was lonely, tired, and sad. So we walked and talked for 10 minutes but i said no to his numbers, im so blessed that he was a good guy, this also made my 5/10 mood to 6,5/10 lol.

90-100k: I was around 1-2km away from home. Its challenging, but better because all i have to do is walk around the house.


Ifff anyone whos just a regular gym goer like me (not a distance runner or athletes) want to do this, If possible, I reccomend you guys to talk to a friend, ask them to encourage you. I was sad when none of my friends cared (except that one girl i mentioned). Also dont start at 5 am. Start earlier. Bring powerbanks and earphone, and if possible, go with someone!"
Disordered,"Adjusting my workout routine for fat loss without losing gains?  On my journey of body acceptance I have been allowing myself to eat intuitively but keep the focus on protein intake and healthy, natural foods over processed, high calorie but nutritionally valueless, greasy, foods. 

I have managed to maintain my weight, maybe gain a little bit, in the last 6 months, but my strength gains have been phenomenal. 

For reference, I am 5’0” tall and currently around 178lbs. I am definitely overweight and have a lot of excess body fat. 

But in the last few years of weightlifting I’ve managed some significant muscle growth and strength gains. I am especially proud because 3 years ago after knee surgery I could barely walk let alone stand up from a chair, and this week I’ve hit PRs of 245lbs for deadlift and 225lbs for squat. 

Of course, In order to lose fat I will need to track and reduce caloric intake. Nutrition is key for fatloss, this I know already. Adding in a little cardio will also help. 

However, I’m concerned with how I will get through some of these brutal workouts on less energy, though. 

I typically have a Legs1-Push1-Pull1-Legs2-Push2-Pull2-Rest routine, where I’ll focus a 5x5 lift on one of the “big five” + sumo DL, and then accessorize 7 other exercises in the same groups. 

For example, on one pull day i’ll focus on standard deadlift and do lighter rows, but on another day focus on rows and go heavier, and then on both days do variations of the same upper and lower back exercises and biceps. 

I typically end each workout with a quick 7minute ab circuit, (3 exercises for 30 seconds, 3 sets, with 40sec rest between sets) and do 20-minute sprint intervals on push days or just do a light walk or elliptical if i’m low energy and have the time. 


So while i’m cutting calories, should I just adjust my main lifts to a lower weight, but do everything the same but just expect less ability for overload progression, or something else? Like no PRs for a while, haha"

Neutral,"Very slow progression in training program?  Hey there, so I've been giving online coaching a try, mostly ouf of curiosity. I'm doing a classic PPL split with 6 weekly sessions. He's an advocate of quite slow progression. So one only should increase the weight on an exercise when exceeding the rep ranges, let's say doing 9 reps on Bench Press when it's 5-8 reps with 2-3 RIR. What are your thoughts on that? 

To me it sounds quite reasonable but nearly everywhere one reads ""for linear progression one should increase the weight on compound movements especially every week"".
I'm aware everybody responds differently to a program but I'd appreciate any input. Thank you."
Disordered,"How do I do a freaking pushup? Youtube technique is divided and confusing me.  I am having trouble busting out a single standard pushup. I have researched on youtube and there are two schools of thought that I have seen.

2. Go slow and begin to incline down inch by inch.

What is everyone's opinion on this? Did anyone here ever struggle with a pushup and can now do many pushups? I would like to know how you did it. Thank you and have a wonderful day! I am a complete beginner and would love some advice on this!

Neutral,"why do you think water aerobics classes lean so female and so senior? who has tried it?  Hello community! I'm (35f) an avid runner, swimmer,  and now beginner weightlifter. I've been intrigued by water aerobics classes for some time but have never tried it. I see the classes often when I'm in the pool swimming or if I'm stretching in the hot tub. 

What's strange is I don't think I've ever seen someone under 60 ish in one of the classes.  And generally in a large class I see 1 or no men. What are your theories for this? So far my only theory is that a class like this is optimal for those with osteoporosis (primarily older women) who cannot do weight-bearing exercise and it creates a culture that attracts a similar demographic. 

I'm tempted to try it as an active rest day but I think I could be discounting the difficulty of the class since I often see frail individuals participating in the class.  Maybe it's like spin what the difficulty is very easily individualized.

Who has experience? Were you able to get your heart rate up? What are your theories for such a consistent demographic? If you're younger, did anyone give you any grief for joining in? It seems like an exclusive club at my pool!

Edit: thanks all! It's settled, I'm definitely going to give it a try.  I'll come prepared to share stories of my kids and doggo:)"

The gym I go to is air conditioned(ish) and the exercises are not way beyond my ability, but I do work out reasonably hard.  I go at the first time I can (5:30 am) and don't eat before going.

My problem is that I start feeling super gross / pukey after a while of working out.  I don't feel dehydrated and don't have any other symptoms of being in danger, but my stomach feels super queasy.

After a bit of a gym hiatus, I've gotten back into fitness and have decided that a personal goal for me this time is trying to develop my abs. Whilst I've gotten a good start on the nutritional side of this, a lot of the exercises that meaningfully develop the abs also develop the obliques. Of course, there's nothing wrong with stronger obliques, but the body shape I'm hoping to achieve sort of necessitates a degree of avoiding filling out the obliques (i.e. I want a slimmer waist). Last time, I focused on plank, and felt that it didn't really deliver the results I was looking for. I was wondering which exercises can help my abdominal muscles pop whilst perhaps either not targeting, or working the obliques in a way that induces less hypertrophy. 

For what it's worth I'm also developing my upper legs and shoulders to fill out the areas near my waist, but my genetics can only do so much in this regard.

Here is a video of one of my sets from my squat session yesterday. This is my fourth of five sets, 5x3, last AMRP (did 5), all at 110. 

I have been following a program for a year (5/3/1 for 6 months, currently GZCLP for about 5 months). I had to take a month off because of Covid in February. 

I am worried that I lean forward too far, but I feel unbalanced if I stay more upright. I have very long legs compared to my upper body, if that perhaps impacts things.

I *love* cardio. I genuinely enjoy the out of breath feeling and my heart pumping. Cardio is one of the few times my brain slows down enough for me to just live. Putting on an audiobook and walking or going for a run is the highlight of my week, seeing how much faster and longer I can go each time. I took an aerobic step class once and nearly died from it and it was the best thing ever. I cannot overstate how much I enjoy cardio.

Disordered,"How do I make cardio less soul-crushingly BORING?  Hey all, 
I’ve been on a fitness journey for two and a half years. 
In that time I’ve gone from 121kg and sedentary (165cm), to roughly 95kg and working out three times a week minimum. 

I do weightlifting twice a week and cardio boxing once a week, and mma twice a month. 

I’m also still recovering from a dislocated kneecap from a year ago. It’s at 95% I’d say. 

But I’m plateauing with my weight loss (at 1600cals and 150g protein a day)
My lifting trainer has said that I need to: 
-do 30min fasted cardio every morning 
-4x10 min “brisk walks” a day 
-cut out all alcohol 
-only have one off plan meal a week (for social life) 
-add two extra solo workout sessions a week 

The problem I have is that walking and the fasted cardio (exercise bike in my case) are so. flipping. boring. 

(I do the cardio with my recumbent bike because it’s easy on my knee.)

Does anyone have any tips to help??? I’m losing my mind and it’s only day two of this 90day “experiment”."

Neutral,"Routine/Workout Boredom  This has been happening to me since I was in high school (I'm in my mid thirties now): I'll get into a routine working out 3-4 days per week, slowly start to drop off after a few months, and then stop entirely for another few months. I'll start back up, hit it hard for a while, fall off the wagon, wash, rinse, repeat. Since Covid started, I can't get more than a few weeks under my belt before I lose interest. It's not that I'm too tired, sore, or injured, I just feel... bored with it. Lifting has been my main gig for the last 5 years and I have the convenience of a basement gym set up, but it just doesn't have the appeal that it used to for me anymore. I've tried different programs and routines to switch it up a little, tried barbell only, tried body weight fitness, dumbbell only, kettlebell only, or a combination of all of the above, but I can't stick with it.

I thought about trying something different like Muay Thai since I've never done any combat sports before, or maybe doing HIIT classes since I've been avoiding intense cardio for years, I just can't afford to pay for gym memberships or more than a few lessons at the moment.

Does this happen to anyone else? Do you just go with it and try something else out for a while to stay active? Or do you just give yourself a kick in the ass and keep going?"

Neutral,"How often do you do intense exercise?  I’m at a bit of a loss and I’m wondering how hard everyone else that’s actually into fitness goes. 

I used to do 4-6 sessions of intense training a week. Think circuit and HIIT style, 45 mins each. I realised after doing that for about 6 months that it’s probably a bit much for my body, and I need a gentler form of exercise to mix in with my intense sessions. 

I’ve now stepped away from that studio and have started trying to do more of a Pilates mixed with intense exercise sort of split, but god dammit my mind just fucks with me and keeps on trying to get me to do like 4 days a week of gasping for air sessions. It’s like I feel guilty for not absolutely wrecking myself at least 60% of the week. And yet on the days that I do that intense exercise I get wild sugar cravings and I am exhausted around 1pm (sleep 8 hours, eat 700+ cals after working out on those days so it’s not from running on low fuel or low sleep). 

Anyway my question being, how often do you guys think is right to do intense sessions? How many days do you guys fit in some milder exercise vs. some full on exercise in your routine?"

Now looking to pick up one of her 10week programs and follow through, rather than selecting random videos for the day.

I can't seem to find too many reviews and experiences from people sticking with HR for a long time. It's always people hyping Caroline Girvan or comparing both, still with 90% opting for CG.

Neutral,"Supplemental work/split advice  Reposting to meet sub rules :) 

Hey lovely redditors! So I’m looking to amp up my fitness schedule to help supplement and compliment my current regime. I’m a 5”0 26f currently weighing about 150lbs.

Atm I do CrossFit 2x a week and do a pole dancing class 1x a week (I also walk to and from work which is about an hour in total). I’ve been doing CrossFit for about the last 4/5 years and just started the pole class in January bc I wanted a ‘fun’ exercise in my life - my strength level isn’t really an issue at all, I’m happy with how I progress and would like to just maintain that in my supplemental sessions. My main goals for the next year are so are to get a pull up (kipping or strict) and get my chopper (invert) on pole. (I would also like to work on my box jumps and handstands but tbh I think that’s a mental block more than a physical one).

I have no plans at this point to increase either my CrossFit or pole sessions so my question is - if I were to add an additional 2 days in a regular gym would it be more beneficial that I - a) go 2x full body sessions
b) do one upper and one lower session 
Or c) I’m overthinking this and I should just let the vibes carry me. 

Thanks in advance guys :)"
Disordered,"Intermediate hypertrophy-ish program?  I've been lifting for about a year now - I did Before the Barbell and then moved on to GZCLP, and have gotten to:

* 130lb 5x3 squat (1.0x bodyweight)
* 150lb 5x3 deadlift (1.15x bodyweight)
* 75lb 6x2 bench (0.57x bodyweight)
* 55lb 5x3 OHP (0.42x bodyweight)

I'm getting a little bored with GZCLP, and am generally pretty happy with my level of strength / not looking to actively improve my numbers right now. I'm interested in a program that requires a little less rest time between sets, maybe something a little more hypertrophy-focused. A lot of the beginner programs are too easy for me now, but I don't quite feel ""intermediate"" yet / am a little overwhelmed by the number of possibilities. I enjoy squats and deadlifts a lot more than the upper body work, so something I can modify to fit that would be awesome (a lot of programs targeted at men are 2 upper / 1 lower day, and I'd prefer more like 2 lower / 1 upper)

Anyone have something they moved on to after GZCLP that they liked?

For context, my motivations to lift are: have a good strength foundation as I get older > get better at pole and general dance > have a body I feel and look good in."

Neutral,"Stronger by the Day for complete newbie?  My wife and I were checking out Megsquats the past couple days, and although we love her content and find that it would be something we could do together, we did have some things we found that left us confused. I'm hoping a few of you that subscribe with her can help us out

We signed up for the free sample week to check things out. Our intent was to find a program that starts you at day one and you progress from there. It seems that once you subscribe, everyone is getting the same workouts sent to them every week. How does this work for someone who is starting week 1 vs someone who may have been doing this for several months. (I hope I'm explaining this right).

Also, along the same lines, we looked at the workouts in the sample week and it seemed quite complex. There were supersets etc. We are looking for something very simple to start, where you aren't bouncing through several different pieces of equipment at once. I may be missing something, but it seems this would be a great program for people who already know their way around a gym already?

If this isn't really practical for us to do at this time, is there someone else you think we should check out? Preferably a woman trainer, but one we could both train to, and one that is going to progress us through serious weight training over a period of time (squats, DL, bench etc). We are not looking for a ""Beachbody"" type of workout as we have done that sort of thing in the past. Now we want to lift heavy things and put them back down again lol!

Neutral,"What does failure/failed rep look like to you?  Hi all - long time lurker of this subreddit!

I’ve been on the GZCLP program for 2 months now. I’m not a novice to lifting, but Im not an intermediate - I hadn’t always been the most consistent in programs in the past as well past knee and wrist injuries. Love this program because it’s efficient but still a great work out.

I feel great and advancing through the progression accordingly (ie move on to 6x2 with slightly increased weight, if you fail 5x3). 

My concern is that now that I’m really approaching heavier weights, while I can complete the reps, my form is struggling (my butt going up too early on a squat to compensate for weight as an example - it’s beginning to become a weird “Good Morning” form). I don’t want to continue going up in weight if my form struggles, but at the same time, I understand that programs work best when you maintain the progression provided.

So these are some options and things I’ve been thinking/found…

1. Is this when one deloads? I feel I’m not necessarily stalling and I feel like it’s too early

2. Do I just “reset” and move my weights down a little back to where my form is better and work from there?

3. Is Tier 2 where I should be grounding good form and then tier 1 where I should be focusing on the weight? Or the other way?

4. Am I cuckoo and need to stop overthinking?

Any advice or ways people have approached this?

Deadlift | 145lbs

My general goal is to get into better shape, get stronger, and it wouldn’t hurt to lose a few pounds here and there.

Sending my biggest thanks in advance!

Edit: to clarify, not running 6x2 progression - was just using as example to show my understanding of the program’s progression sorry about that misunderstanding."

Due to some very unfortunate issues with ankle mobility - I broke both my ankles years ago when I was in HS playing on the tennis team - I've had a very slow progression with my training, but consistent ankle-targeted stretching and strengthening has noticeably helped. I still use heeled lifting shoes for any lifts outside of hip thrusts, but can otherwise squat and RDL just fine.

I only mention all of this because my ankle mobility/stability was so poor I had unbelievable difficulty keeping my balance to complete a lunge or BSS with bodyweight. I *finally* am able to do lunges mostly without any worry with losing my balance, including with weight, which is a huge milestone for me. 

I have wanted to try the BSS now that I feel confident and capable, but trying it with a bench as my support leaves me feeling like a weeble-wobble. I'm 5'9 with long-ish femurs?, and have heard that you can use plates under your feet instead of a bench for a more stable BSS, but I haven't actually seen any informative videos that show this. Has anyone here tried doing BSS this way? Or have any other tips, etc for doing them another way without a bench? Thanks!"

Disordered,"what gym upper body workout for an inverted triangle body shape ?  Hi guys,
I am a 175cm (5'9), 60 kgs 19year old who wants to get a stronger upper body but does not want to add mass to my arms, lats and shoulders especially, as I am rather looking to balance my proportions by gaining mass on the lower body. 
I am an inverted triangle (narrow hips, lean legs, broad shoulders and small chest), and I grow muscle quite easily even with low weights on my upper body, but that area is still weak af and I do want to get stronger, especially my back ( often get back pain and I want that strong back with a valley looking spine hehe).

I already got my lower body workout planned out and I am aiming to train it 2x-3x times per week max, but I am clueless about which exercises are the most important for my upper body, i.e. which are the most effective.

I would ideally train upper body once to twice MAX per week because I'm a busy (and lazy :) ) student. 

Do you have any recommendations or experience as an inverted triangle? 
Thanks for your help ☺️"
Disordered,"Help w/ Signing up for 1st powerlifting meet  So I want to sign up for my first powerlifting meet, but the signup form ([https://meets.revolutionpowerlifting.com/2022/11/12/autumn-apocalypse-newark-nj/](https://meets.revolutionpowerlifting.com/2022/11/12/autumn-apocalypse-newark-nj/))  got me kind of frazzled.

Bonus rule book for meet ([https://www.revolutionpowerlifting.com/rulebook/?page\_id=16](https://www.revolutionpowerlifting.com/rulebook/?page_id=16)) 

I have a few questions on what options I should pick when I sign up:

&#x200B;

1. If I want to compete in the squat, bench, and deadlift - would that fall under the ""Full Power"" event option? On the sign up sheet, it seems to allow you to select more than one ""event"" to sign up for. The ""Ironman"" event seems to just cover the dead and bench. If I also want to compete in this event, would they just take my best scores from my three attempts and use it for the ""Full Power"" and ""Ironman"" data?
2. Weight class - I hover at around 126 lbs at 5'2.5"" comfortably (I can cut to sub 123, but I am extremely lean at this weight | I can get to 132 easily, but I am uncomfortably fat at this weight) . I see for this meet they have women's weight classes at 123 and 132. I assume those are the max weights you can be for each class? If I want to complete around 126lbs, should I pick the 132 weight class?
3. Division - I see that this meet I want to sign up for has multiple ""divisions"" (  Multi-ply, Single-ply,  
Raw Classic without Knee Wraps or Sleeves, Raw Modern with Knee Wraps or Sleeves). I usually lift without any equipment. I assume I would pick the ""Raw classic w/out knee sleeves"" division.
4. Clothing - I see on the website rules, it says you need to wear a **One-piece lifting suit (singlet).** Where would you suggest buying one of these for a newbie lifter? Also, for footwear it says it is ""optional"".... So can I wear any shoes (like running sneakers) during the lifts? Also, what belts can you use/recommend for these competitions?

Disordered,"Article: The Drawbacks of Using Wearable Devices to Inform Nutrition Targets (MacroFactor website)  [Link to the article](https://macrofactorapp.com/wearables/)

&#x200B;

*A note up front: This is an article by Greg Nuckols, one of the creators of MacroFactor app, on the website for MacroFactor. Nuckols and the Stronger by Science crew are IMO some of the more intellectually rigorous folks in the fitness space, and I generally trust that they are not being dishonest about science to sell their product. But just for full transparency I do want to be clear about the fact that the framing of this article is primarily around why MacroFactor works the way it does, and obviously includes plenty of plugs for the product. I think there is a lot of value in the scientific content even if you have zero interest in MacroFactor, but it is totally understandable if product-associated content is something you'd rather skip.*

&#x200B;

I thought this would be of interest to the xxfit community since there are often discussions in the dailies about how to best use data from wearable fitness devices (FitBit, Apple Watch, etc), which devices are the best, etc. It's long, but very in depth.

Some highlights:

* Several systematic reviews and studies published over the last couple of years suggest that wearables have very high errors when estimating energy expenditures. A [2020 systematic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32897239/) found that ""in free-living settings, wearable devices result in average under- or  over-estimates of energy expenditure by more than 10% a whopping 82% of  the time""
* In a [2022 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957939/) of newer generation wearables, the best performing device/exercise combo was the Apple Watch 6 during running. But even that had a mean error of 14.9 ± 9.8%. And that was the absolute best case scenario for that particular study - other exercises with the Apple Watch 6, and other wearables performed worse.
* From a behavioral/mental health perspective, ""a system that allows you to “eat back” calories expended via exercise  has the potential to encourage an adversarial relationship with  exercise, or potentially even encourage disordered eating patterns.""
* The relationship between calories burned during exercise and TDEE is not purely additive. If your non-exercise TDEE is 2000 calories and you burn 500 calories on a long run, that doesn't necessarily mean your TDEE for the day is 2500. Your body might compensate by decreasing [NEAT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12468415/). One recent study linked in the article demonstrated that in some conditions, 100 calories burned in exercise translated into a 72 calorie change in TDEE, on average. So unless wearables are accounting for that (and we generally don't know one way or another, since the algorithms are not publicly available) even if they perfectly estimated calories burned they would not give you an accurate TDEE.
* When are wearables useful? They are pretty accurate in measuring step counts and heart rate. Many folks use step count for general health and measure heart rate for their cardio training. If that is you, rest assured that your device is probably doing a good job.
* One other way wearables could be useful: When determining if weight changes are are *random fluctuations* based on something like food in the gut or water retention, vs the beginning of a new trend (e.g. you just went from sedentary to running five days a week). A wearable will instantly know that your TDEE Is higher than it used to be. Whereas approaches such as what MacroFactor uses - looking backward at how your intake and weight have changed in the recent past - will take a week or two to ""catch up"" to the fact that your TDEE is now higher.

&#x200B;

xxfitness, I am curious about your thoughts on the article. I'm also curious about the role wearables play in your health/fitness/training. Have you found them helpful? If you also track weight + calories in pretty rigorously, do you find them accurate (if so: what is your primary form of exercise?).

Neutral,"Hormonal birth control and its impact on muscle creation/fat loss  Hello all, 

I've been lifting weights 4-5 days a week for three or so months now, and saw something on instagram regarding body fat percentage/calorie intake that immediately made me think of hormonal birth control. Essentially someone was training for a competition and was at very low caloric intake for the 3 weeks leading up to the event (1300 and then down to 1148 for the week of), where the trainer had  commented that the client's sex drive had not been affected during this period of time, and then had gotten her up to maintenance at 2200 calories and only a 0.8kg gain. 

ANYWAY this made me think of hormonal BC - I'm on Yaz and I wonder what kind of effect the suppression of testosterone is having on my overall progress. I'd like to stop taking it but also would like to not have a child. Thinking of a copper IUD but that sounds like a nightmare tbh based on several anecdotes I've both heard about and read. 

My primary question is: has anyone stopped taking hormonal BC and noticed a change in body composition/training?"
Disordered,"[FORM CHECK] Deadlift & squat  I posted this in the r/fitness weekly stupid questions thread but I'd like to get your feedback as well! How do my deadlifts and squats look? Feel free to nitpick every tiny little detail, I'm definitely into that shit. My apologies for the crooked angles, as you can see in one of the videos I had to put my phone in my shoe to film myself 😅

Two sets of conventional deadlifts with 50 kgs (110 lbs) which is a decent working weight for me, doesn't feel light but it's not a serious struggle either. I could go 2,5-5 kgs  (\~5-10 lbs) heavier but then my grip starts to fail (I'm doing overhand with no chalk or straps). With deadlifts I like to think I know what I'm doing and I feel confident lifting and increasing weight, but I'd like to hear if you guys think so too. [https://imgur.com/a/AQPujtM](https://imgur.com/a/AQPujtM)

And then two sets of high bar squats with 30 kgs (66 lbs), which is approximately as heavy as I dare to go because I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm still learning the technique and every rep is  accompanied by mental calculations and a thousand things to remember, lol. Also it always feels like I'm spending a looong time in the hole, does it look like that too? [https://imgur.com/a/A1DxhHs](https://imgur.com/a/A1DxhHs)"
Neutral,"CROSS TRAINING FOR POLE/AERIAL need help making my training efficient  Hi, I hope this post doesn't break any rules, I feel like I need my own post rather than ask a quick question in one of the weekly posts.

So I found a sport I love, which is aerials (pole, hoop and silks). I train pole at home when I feel like it, and do hoop once a week. My goals are to increase strength (especially back and core) and flexibility so that I can become a better aerial dancer.

I also have a gym membership. I have not been super consistent with my training and lack a proper plan. I tend to overthink my training a lot and switch plans or not doing anything at all because it's not the ""perfect plan"".

So basically I'm wondering how to train optimally (what splits, workouts, frequency etc.) at the gym to improve my performance doing aerials. I'm guessing calisthenics training would be good, and I've done a bit of the recommended routine in the past, but I prefer to train at the gym.

Perhaps some of you who do pole/aerials have a routine that you would like to share? Do you do a ""classic"" weight lifting program + your aerial training? Something else? How do you incorporate mobility/flexibility training in your routine?

Neutral,"17f, interested in building strength and I have a few questions  Firstly, I'm not sure how to go about it in terms of diet. My main focus is to build strength, not muscle mass. Obviously muscle mass would be a nice bonus, but since it's not my main priority as of right now, do I still need to do the whole cutting/bulking thing? Or can I stick to my current diet (which is 50% carbs, 20% protein, 30% fat). If so, should I eat at maintenance calories, or add some more to make up for the exercise?

Secondly, I'm also a runner. I run 4-6 times a week, usually interval training in preparation for cross country. Will this affect my strength training in any way? And again, should I add to my maintenance calories to make up for the calories burned? I don't know if weight loss will affect strength gain. 

And finally, does anyone have any recommendations for a good beginners bodyweight routine? Or should I learn the individual exercises (such as pushups, which I'm terrible at) first before jumping into a routine?

Any and all advice would be appreciated! Thanks!"
Neutral,"What are your favorite simple bodyweight exercises?  I'm hoping to build an easy morning workout routine into my days. I decided I wanted to try to build my own workouts rather than following along with a video, so I wanted to compile a list of exercises I can do either with nothing or just with dumbbells. 

The idea I have in mind is that I will have an extensive list of exercises that fall into upper body, lower body, and core, then pick three from each category to do a few sets of every day. Of course some exercises will fall into more than one category but that's fine! 

Some obvious ones I have down are squats, leg lifts, hip bridges, lunges, planks, planks with dumbbell curls, bicep/tricep curls

I am in real need of more for upper body especially (arms, back, chest), so I'd love to hear what your favorites are!

Edit: Thanks everyone for the amazing suggestions! So many of these I'd never even heard of, so I have quite a bit of learning to do haha. I am going to compile everything into a spreadsheet and can share it here if there's any interest. I'm always happy to hear more, y'all are truly awesome! :)"
Neutral,"Do you feel welcome at your gym?  In the beginning I was very heavily targeted for PT sessions by floor trainers and they all came with assumption that weight loss was my priority. This is a standard commercial gym I go to, so I understand that's what a big percentage of people are looking for, I still thought that the aggressive campaigning for ""you must be tired of being fat, you need us to help you with that"" was in bad taste. Considering that I specifically was NOT interested in weight loss at that time, I wanted to lift, that's it. They have a board with all the trainers in the lobby and indeed most of them specialise in weight loss and ""toning"", I checked.

I grew resenting most people working there because of how I was approached. I can't shake off the feeling that although I'm allowed to attend and use the equipment, I'm doing it ""against the gym policy"". They've made it very clear what they think I should be doing, and I feel that I'm being judged and looked down upon for not complying. I've been going for 2 years, so obviously it didn't deter me, but that feeling some people describe, gym being their meditative space, place where they go to relax - I don't have that. I march in like I'm about to fight for my rights to be there.

Lately I've been wondering if I need to find a different place. But if it's another commercial gym, wouldn't it be the same?

Disordered,"struggling with super low weight squat  I've been benching 75, deadlifting 115, but I can barely squat the bar. I've been doing 3x10 with a 30lb dumbbell, whereas with the other 2 I'm comfortable doing 5x5 or up to 5x7. I've been working just as hard on quads and leg exercises as with everything else


Some more backstory: I started lifting in late January, for the first 2 months or so I did more machines and body weight stuff to get ready for big lifts. My quads seem strong, like they're visibly chunky, and I can do 2x as much weight with leg extensions as with leg curls. When I do leg curls, it seems to strain my calves (which I do work sometimes and they're not unusually weak either). When I deadlift, I've been really trying to get my hips low and use my hamstrings, and they're always sore for the next few days but as a newbie I'm probably using my back more than I should. I mention this because when I squat, it feels like my hamstrings activate more than they should so my suspicion is that they're too weak. I do use a slightly wider stance because I have knock knees and I feel like I'm gonna fall over if I'm perfectly shoulder width. But it's only a couple inches difference.


I also had to take about 5 weeks off in late april/may due to getting covid and then immediately starting 12hr days at work. I'm back to about where I was before and my bench/deadlift seem to be progressing nicely, but squats are still so hard! I've collapsed twice now and been totally unable to get up with like, 50 lbs. Any advice or thoughts at all are welcome and appreciated 💓"

Disordered,"Stronglifts 5x5, lighter barbells, and incremental weights  I just started Stronglifts 5x5 this week (just trialing it before I officially start on Monday) and I've run into a few ""issues"" I need to troubleshoot, and I'm looking for suggestions/product recommendations  


To start, the app has me at:  
Squat- 35 lbs  
Bench Press: 25 lbs  
Barbell Row: 25 lbs  
Overhead press: 10 lbs  
Deadlift: 45 lbs.

With a 2 lb increase each session.

The first issue I have is that my gym doesn't offer anything smaller than 5 lb weight plates. Not a big deal. I can order some 1-lb plates and use those for the smaller increments.   


The bigger issue is that the empty bar weighs 45 lbs and there aren't lighter ones available. There are fixed barbells that start at 25 lbs, but those go up in 10-lb increments. I looked at Microgainz weight plates to add to those, but it would cost me about $150 to bridge the gap between the 25 and 35 and 35 and 45 lb barbells.  


Plus, that doesn't help me with overhead press. My gym does have dumbbells and between what I have at home and what the gym has (assuming I'd start with 5 lbs in each hand) I can do some of the increases. My gym has 5, 7.5, and 10 lb dumbbells. I own 6 and 8s that I can bring from home. (And if I'm starting out with 10 lbs in each hand, I have access to 10, 12, and 15 lb weights).   


It seems the most practical solution would be to use the closest dumbells or fixed barbell as possible and get some incremental weights that can be added to them (so, I'd add 1 lb to my 8 lb dumbbells when increasing to 9 lbs, and switch to the 25 lb barbell when I get there), but that seems costly.  


So, my quesiton is:   


What are some good, inexpensive options for increasing weights gradually using dumbbells or a fixed barbell while I build up my strength to the 45 lb bar? (Or would I be better off buying a 25 lb bar and bringing that in? I haven't been able to find a bar that weighs less than that that will still work with the plates)."

Disordered,"Switching from CrossFit to lifting?  I’ve been doing CrossFit for almost a year and a half about 4 times a week. I’ve put on about 10lbs of muscle and fat during this time and now I’d like to shed some of the fat. Historically, I’ve just been eating when I was hungry so I wouldn’t officially call it a bulk phase .. but it definitely wasn’t a maintenance or cutting phase.

I’ve tried to cut weight (cutting no more than 500 calories a day) and continue CrossFit but I’m seriously dragging with the HIIT/cardio part of our workouts - I’m also starting to loathe them, but that’s a different topic.

Anyway, would it be a good idea to switch over to strictly lifting and light cardio to cut weight or should I suck it up and continue with CrossFit?

Also, My current gripe with CrossFit is that we rarely do the same exercise twice in a week so I feel like I’m not progressing as much as I could during lifts - which is something I’d like to achieve. I’m certainly not destined for the CrossFit games but I’d like to deadlift 200lbs (5’4 female, 145 lbs)"

I generally benefit from accountability systems so I believe that a personal trainer would be great for me, including setting up a program and then having regular check-ins to see how the program is working in practice. However, I don’t relate to the vast majority of personal trainers who (in my impression) focus primarily on physique goals and on kind of “fighting yourself” approach, or pushing yourself towards your limit. I would like to have a more balanced, moderate relationship with exercise.

Disordered,"Form Check - Conventional Deadlift  Hello everyone,

I've filmed my conventional deadlift at two different angles (45degrees and from the side). Hopefully that allows everyone to see the lift properly. I think I'm not breathing properly through the lift but I'm sure there are other points that need working on. Are my hips starting too high? Does anyone have any tips for those of us with sweaty hands? I find I have to stop mid-set and wipe my hands on my leggings/towel.

Disordered,"RDL beginner - looking for tips on form, stories on progress  Hey all! I posted a little while back and got some great feedback, I read through the wiki and I was hoping to get some more feedback on my form. I will preface this by saying I know I need new shoes. I'm clearly rocking on my feet because of wearing cushiony running shoes, so any suggestions for good shoes are appreciated. Other than that I'd like to learn a little more about when to up the weight, how frequently should I be doing these, when can I upgrade to full deadlifts, etc. Link below for video I took this morning of my RDLs:

Disordered,"How to communicate with personal trainer without sounding pushy/Are the things I’m asking reasonable?  I bought a starter package with a trainer at my gym since I’m relatively new to weightlifting. I incorrectly assumed based off a prior experience, that all personal trainers have a similar approach. Now that I know what to expect from our sessions I wanted to check if the things I was going to ask for are reasonable? And how to communicate them without coming across as pushy or a backseat driver.


My main goal from this was to build a routine that I could follow, and learn enough to safely workout alone. I didn’t mention this during the assessment because I mistakenly thought it was implied. We only have a few sessions together which aren’t enough to see much improvement, so I thought it would be going over the basics and building a foundation for me to work off of.


I wasn’t given an overview or anything of what they were planning to do and currently I just show up and do what they tell me to. I tried to keep track myself, but it takes me the full session to get through all the exercises and the rests I’m given between sets are the amount of time it takes me to drink water. 


Is it rude to ask if that’s something we can make time to go over? Or to just give me a bit of time to jot things down before going right into another exercise? 


It also feels like they’re overestimating my level of fitness. Some of the exercises they have me doing feel a bit too intense for me right now and definitely not something I could do on my own with proper form. Like doing elevated split squats with a yoga ball and TRX machine with my terrible balance when I haven’t even done them on a solid surface before.


They have a boot camp/drill Sargent approach and have made jokes about me slacking because they weren’t watching (in actuality it was my first time doing the exercise and couldn’t see my form because we weren’t facing a mirror) so I feel like they’d just interpret the request as me complaining/whining and I’m not sure how to phrase it as otherwise.

Edit: Thank you for the advice! Bit of a hectic week so I’ve only been able to go through most of these now. I did ask about creating a routine and was given a but more time to write some of the stuff down.

I also asked to switch back to split workouts since they were less stressful on my body. She said that she upped the intensity of my past workouts because we don’t see each other very often so that explains that 😅"
Neutral,"Has anyone else experienced more hostility from people when you get more muscular?  I've recently gotten into better shape and due to my endometriosis and other chronic illnesses I have to follow a really restricted diet (I have so many food triggers and if I eat the wrong thing I am sick and unable to do much for days). Building more muscle and lowering my body fat has made me look really muscular, I got lucky with my broad shoulders and muscle building genetics and have big round shoulders now. I know I look kind of androgynous too, it is what it is, but I've come to like how I look after many years of struggling with my body image and PMDD-related dysphoria.

I have been receiving more hostility from people lately, directly related to how I look. Generally it's in the realm of dating, so I mostly assume the men sending me rude messages about how I look are more or less insecure about themselves. I don't let it get to me, but I've just been kind of puzzled about the reactions I'm getting from people regarding that I'm more muscular. I've had men send me messages saying they can't tell if I'm a man or woman and I just roll my eyes, laugh and block. 

But its made me curious if this is something that has happened to other buff looking women? Maybe I'm just having bad luck, maybe it's just because I look androgynous and I know that kind of thing can bother certain people. Anyone else experience anything like this?

Edit: Wow I can't believe how many people related to this or have otherwise experienced some type of body shaming. Humans are beautiful in all shapes, sizes and colors! Thank for all for the insight and encouragement, I had a killer work out today and my shoulders and lats are looking extra beefy 👌 I think we are all in agreement that this behavior stems from a place of deep insecurity and low self-esteem mixed with a good dose of misogyny, sprinkled in some other issues on top. And, we all agree that this stuff doesn't affect us and that we will continue to slay our work outs regardless. Much love to you all!"

I'm a newbie in my thirties, and I've been a member of a gym for a year, and I started doing squats on the smith machine (they don't have squat racks) about 4 months ago.

Since then, I have changed gyms for personal reasons. Now, I have squat racks and no smith machines. So I've started using the squat racks, and I can only squat confidently with very light weight. 

When I put more than 25s on, I feel like I'm going to fall. I almost did once, and my bf caught me. I left the gym with my head low and tears on my face. I have tremendous gym anxiety, and I just want to do well. But I cannot get over my fear of dropping the bar. It is also worth noting that it's highly male dominant and everyone is huge.

Heavy weight lifting, bootcamp classes, cycling, Pilates, kickboxing, etc. Still the fastest and most effective way for me to lose weight is from running. And not even a long run. I can do 10-20 minutes a day and it’s almost alarming how lean I get vs. 60 minutes of straight kickboxing or a targeted weight-lifting program. I don’t even mean weight-wise (I don’t often go by the scale but just how my clothes fit, measurements, etc.) - it’s just a nice toned/lean look that I can’t achieve otherwise.

I always use stoppers on the bar when I lift, even when it's easy to keep the bar horizontal, for example deadlifts. So I was just wondering what is everyone's take on plate stoppers? Do you use them?

Disordered,"How fast can you progress with squats when doing them once a week?  I started weight lifting about 7 months ago, first going to the gym 2 times a week, but since about a month I go 3 times a week. Since I started 7 months ago, I went from 80kg to 66kg. My height is 163cm. Not proud of it, but what certainly contributed to my weight loss as well was the fact that the last half year has been very stressful for me (I am currently in the progress of finishing my master's degree) and when I am stressed I barely eat. During most of the week days I would eat between 1000-1500 calories. I am aware that I will most likely gain a few kilo's when I go back to ""normal"" eating again when I'm not so stressed anymore. 

Since going 3 times a week I follow a 3 day split (one day Chest, Triceps, Shoulders, one day Quads, Glutes, Hamstrings, Calves, and the last day Biceps, Back, Traps, Forearms) where I squat once a week. For almost all exercises I do 3 sets 10 reps, but for squats I decided (as of last week) that I will do 4 sets of 10 reps, as I really want to get my bum back but this time in muscle instead of fat :) Today I managed 1 set 35kg and 3 sets 40kg, next week I will try 4 sets of 40kg. But I feel like I barely progressed, as I started this workout routine with being able to do 1 set of 30kg and 2 sets of 35kg. 

I set a goal for myself, that I want to be able to squat my old bodyweight, so 80kg. But I have no clue how realistic this is and in what time frame. Can I reach that goal in a decent timeframe while sticking to this 3 day split? Or is it advised to try something else? Before doing this split, I did 5x5 which I'm not really a fan of."
Disordered,"How consistent does my training schedule need to be?  And thoughts on having big gaps between strength training days? I'm a beginner working on a 3 days/week program but it's a little hard for me to pick a consistent schedule. I just moved to an area with little sunshine so when the sun does come out, I'll usually go for a long walk and then I won't have time to also do my training day... there's not that many exercises each day but it's taking me an entire hour to finish the workout, including warm up, making sure to keep form in check, etc.

So based on the weather and my work schedule, sometimes I won't train for two/three days and end up taking 1.5 weeks to get through a week of the designated program. Is this bad? I think doing two consecutive days of training would be worse because no rest time, but sometimes my schedule is just really unpredictable and I'm not sure what to do. Should I be doing some small 20 minute strength workouts at home when I don't get to the gym? I have some resistance bands; I'd really prefer to workout at the gym but some days I just don't have time to finish my whole workout.

I already have a tapered belt or however it's called when it has a different width in the front vs back. In the front it's about 6-8 cm, which is around 3 inches I believe and 15 cm in the back.

4 inch belts seem to be the standard for most people training for strength, so I wonder if 3 inch belts are just as good. I am quite pear shaped. My hips are wider than my ribcage, and waist is smaller than both. My torso is average in size for my height.

But what's the point of comparing my times or lifts to anyone else's if I don't fit into either category (weaker than cis men, stronger than cis women.) Even if that happens to *not* actually be true, and my athletic performance is statistically indistinguishable from cis women's, what's the point of competing when people are just going to yell at me and call me names for even trying?

Disordered,"Building muscle while on anti-androgenic birth control (e.g., Yasmin, Yaz, Natazia/Qlaira, Diane 35). Experiences?  Hi folks, are any of you taking anti-androgenic birth control, or took it previously, and trying to re-shape your body through strength and resistance training?

I'm currently taking Natazia (Qlaira in Europe), which contains estrogen and a progestin called Dienogest, which has significant anti-androgenic properties. I've struggled with acne, hirsutism, painful periods, and high LDL cholesterol for most of my life (and spent a lot of money on laser hair removal!), so I went on this pill to combat those issues and it's agreed with me for the past 6 months, knock on wood. I probably have undiagnosed PCOS, but I was never examined for it because I always had regular periods and my weight was low-to-average (I'd never heard of ""lean PCOS"" until recently).

Testosterone and androgen derivatives are obviously critical to building muscle. Estrogen is helpful as well: [here's a study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25610174/) on postmenopausal women, muscle and bone loss, and HRT, but it's just one study and there are risks associated with HRT.

But yes, have any of you been on anti-androgenic birth control pills like Yasmin, Yaz, Natazia, Diane-35, Zoely, etc., and still been able to make significant muscle and strength gains? I've been doing heavy lifting (hip thrusts with 140 lbs of resistance, weighted back squats, clamshells with multiple resistance bands) for about 2 weeks now, so it's too soon to see any results, but I don't feel like my power has diminished that much. I should have less testosterone, but not *none*.

This study - [Antiandrogens in hormonal contraception limit muscle strength gain in strength training: comparison study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12590431/) \- indicates that the answer is ""yes"", antiandrogenic birth control does limit muscle gains, but I was hoping to hear people's real-life experiences.

If that's what this pill does, then that's what I'm going to have to accept, because I don't want to deal with all of the issues I dealt with before (plus, pregnancy prevention!).

Disordered,"Semi private personal training worth it?  I’m looking into hiring a trainer (I want to get into lifting and unfortunately have osteopenia at 33 so need to be careful with my bones!). I went to a local studio, did the assessment and liked the trainer, so asked about pricing. 

The owner quoted me $60 a session for semi private training (4-5 people). He said nutrition counseling would be extra. 

Is that a standard rate? That rate seems high to me, even living in a HCOL area (I’m just outside NYC). From my first session, the trainer was monitoring his clients but there wasn’t that much individualized attention. The studio was small and equipment seemed typical, nothing super fancy. 

Am I better off just doing my own research or is it worth going for accountability/proper training? Would it be rude if I asked about a lower rate or sliding scale? Are there other things I could ask to be included, such as weekly programming for me to do on my own outside the session? 

Thank you so much for any guidance, and I’m sorry if the q is obvious—I just truly have no frame of reference, having never worked with a trainer."

Initially nothing very structured, but started following a dumbbell program 12 ish months ago, followed by a military style barbell one, then SL for 2 months (last Dec to Feb) and back to the military barbell one (4x week 45-60 minutes sessions) until last month. 
Have since started 531 BB/beefcake (just finished week 2 of first cycle).

Initial gains were great, but I started stalling and getting frustrated in the second half of SL and hence I went back to the military bb program I really liked. Although more enjoyable to me, I really struggle with resting/deloading and felt like I was getting burned out so I thought I'd try the 531 and actually try to stick with the programmed deloading. So far, I am definitely liking it more than SL.

Now back to my actual question. While browsing on some posts here, I started to wonder if what I'm currently lifting is too arm heavy (pun intended 😄) and what, if anything I should be doing about it? More leg work? Or just continue with a balanced program as I have been doing so far? I actually cycle (and prefer climbs/heavy resistance work) for my cardio/conditioning so I don't really perceive leg strength as a problem for me.

Recap: home lifter since last year, no professional assistance, free weights only, currently doing 531 BB/beefcake. Feel like my DL/squat are lower in relation to the presses than most others seem to report.

39 y/o, 5,1"", 120-125 lbs

Deadlift 154

Squat 146

Bench press 115

Overhead press 73

(These are 5 rep maxes as that is what I work with, don't really care about single rep records)"

I apologize for the long post! You can scroll down to the bottom to see what exactly I need help with! Thank you ☺️

Story:
In fall 2019 and into the beginning of the pandemic, I was seriously active. While the gyms were open, I was doing cycling classes, barre classes, body pump style classes, and barbell workout sessions. I was in the gym 6 days a week, with one rest day. When I started working from home in Mar 2020, I kept all of this up with free at-home workout classes. I became incredibly lean, got down to 128lbs (58kg) and bought new clothes that would fit my lean frame.

Over the past two years, my lifestyle completely changed. I got a new profession, I moved more than 3,000 miles away, and I got a lot busier. And in the adjustment and new way of life, I stopped working out regularly and started eating more. Gaining about 15 lbs. 

In the middle of May this year still in the foreign country, I joined a gym, I read all of the FAQs on this page, and I started the 5x5 program as a simple, easy to follow program. I could do a warm up, follow the lifts, then cool down and go home. So I started from the beginning, following 5x5 3 times a week plus one cardio day. 

I did the 5x5 for 5 weeks and this was my progress on the lifts:
Squats: 20kg to 40kg
Overhead press: 20kg to 25kg
Deadlift: 30kg to 40kg
Bench press: 20kg to 30kg
Barbell row: 20kg to 25kg

Review of the program:
I LOVED my time in the gym. I loved staying in the power rack and just focusing on my program. I loved being able to listen to podcasts, rest between sets, and see that I’m lifting more now than I was before. 

However… 
I started at 140lbs and today I weighed 145lbs.
My clothes fit tighter. 
I travel for at least one week every month, staying with friends most of the time without access to a gym, so my progress gets set back bc I have to deload after I get back from my trips. 

My SO says the weight gain and tighter clothes is what I can expect from “power lifting” (is 5x5 power lifting?) so I’m thinking I want to change programs, but I don’t know where to go. I also think I need a program that’s more flexible with my traveling. Lighter weight, maybe more agility exercises, maybe use bands I can take with me, etc 

I just moved back to my home country,  and I’m taking about 3 weeks off from the gym as I transition back and take a couple trips (weddings, conference, seeing family I haven’t seen for two years, etc). But in August, I want to start a new program. In September, I have a two week training out of town. But in September 2023 I’m moving back overseas so I want to try to find a routine that I can take with me there too! 

I figured I’d seek advice from this group!

Goal:
Get back to where I was before moving overseas. Lose weight so my clothes fit again and become more muscular and lean. 

What I want in the program: 
I loved 5x5 in every way but I don’t think it fits my goals. So I want something else that is similar and is:
(X) Self guided - I loved classes but right now I like the “me time” from working out alone 
(X) Tracks weights - I want to “progress” and see I started with x but now I’m at y
(X) 30-45 min sessions plus extra for cardio 

But I want it to:
(X) not require a power rack 
(X) use equipment available in most basic gyms. Like hotel gyms, apartment gyms, etc. 
(X) bonus if it gives alternative workouts for traveling

Thanks in advance for your help!"
Neutral,"What are some realistic expectations if you're inactive during the whole day (minus exercising) ?  Background:
I don't want to make this a health related post, but I've spent the past year in bed/sofa due to fatuege and stress related issues. I started ""running"" (slowly) 3 times/week about 2 months ago but I still spend most of my day in a rest state. I've noticed a big improvement in my running although my overall strength and physique is the same. Exercise does a lot of good to my mental health so it's definitely worth it (and recommended by my doctor).

I've now been on a 1 week break due to traveling and as a way to 'get started' again I've decided that I would like to incorporate some basic strength training as well. That said, I probably still have to spend most of my day inactive/resting. I do my best to go on daily 20 minute walks but that's not always happening.

Now to my question: 
I wonder if it's possible to build any muscles/strength when you're basically not active for 22-23 hours each day. I know that it's a lot more that nothing, but I would like to hear if it can make a significant improvement strength wise. I would also like to hear if anyone has ever been in a similar situation and if you noticed an improvement. 🙏"

Neutral,"I keep getting a raging rug burn (also called a butt berry) with sit ups  The rug burn (or ""butt berry"") happens when there is too much friction on your tailbone or the top of your asscrack, usually from not engaging your core properly.

Surely I can't be the only one who deals with this?

Every time I do sit ups (required for military functions), I keep getting rug burned no matter how I try to engage my core. It started cherry red with the skin rubbed off, and swollen under the skin. And I keep re-rubbing it every time I do sit ups on a hard surface (no choice on the surface).

Would putting tape over my tailbone help? I used to bring a towel to sit on but they don't allow that anymore.

My muscles and core is fine during workouts but my poor ass lol. I also have another job where I figure model for artists, so it's infuriating knowing that hipster art students are noticing my rug burn (or the bandaid right on top of my asscrack)."
Disordered,"Best Program for Masculine/Androgynous Aesthetics?  Hey all!

&#x200B;

33 AFAB, 5'3 human here who's been lifting for about two years. For most of those two years, I ran the MoMoMuscle Program and saw a ton of gains there. I wanted something a little more polished/interactive, so I switched over to SBTD. I've gotten stronger (the MMFP doesn't focus as much on the ""big"" lifts), but I'm not sure my aesthetic goals are being hit. I think I'm starting to look a little less masculine / my back is shrinking a little.

I want to balance out my hourglass, DD-having body so I have a broader back and more masculine physique. I really think MMFP helped me, in this respect. I am concerned that SBTD isn't focused as much on my back / aesthetics, and is moreso geared toward strength specifically  instead of aesthetics.

For me, the perks of SBTD is the interactive app (which can track your weights), the awesome discord community, and how fresh the exercises are. The downside is the lack (I think?) of focus on aesthetics so my body is looking a little more feminine again.

The MMFP perks are obviously the tailored training for masc AFAB folks. The downside is the app isn't awesome / can't track weights, and the PDFs are expensive (I do have three of them). 

Anyone else in a similar boat? What programs do you run? Or, can anybody using SBTD who's masc-presenting or has similar aesthetic goals chime in?"

Disordered,"New to lifting -- advice on rest day soreness?  I'm naturally very athletic, but haven't had a dedicated strength regimen for years... and now I'm about a month into lifting weights and a strength program. I have a few questions for you about rest and recovery!

1. Should I be taking cues from my body re: soreness in order to know when to go back for another session, or is 24-48h a good rule regardless of my soreness? How do you deal with this, especially as a beginner?
2. What do you do for yourself between sessions and on your recovery days? I know for me, it will include some combination of rolling/self-massage, hot bath, drinking a ton more water than I normally do, higher calorie load (focus on protein), and extra sleep. What are your tips? Any flags here?

I know the importance of rest days and recovery to build strength and avoid injury, however most of my fitness experience is in training for endurance sports, which of course is a very different recovery focus given the very different nature of training. Would love to learn your best practices as I trial and error here.

Neutral,"Omitting BB squats  Does anyone omit heavy barbell squats from their lifting routine/leg days?

Several years ago, I suffered a lower back/piriformis injury during a lift up while performing a barbell squat, and it still haunts me to this day every time I think about adding a plate to my barbell. That old injury was very painful to the point I couldn't walk and had to crawl up stairs.

I do other leg/glute exercises like DLs, hip thrusts, lunges, cable work, etc. My primary focus to gain is glutes, and I am quad dominant. I realize that BB squats are a compound movement and that that is one of the beneficial aspects of this exercise. However, they scare the crap out of me from wanting to progress heavier even though I have no problems progressing in the other exercises. Also, I feel nothing in my glutes during BB squats whereas when performing other types of squats (goblet for example), I feel it much more in my glutes.

I feel fine when I'm doing other kinds of squats though., i.e., kettblebell, DBs, lighter bb. It's so ingrained in the lifting world to do these heavy ass bb squats, and I just want to feel like it's OKAY to not do them.

Neutral,"Area above knee bigger on one leg than other  Hello! So I’m an 18F and it’s come to my attention my left leg is a bit skinnier and narrower than my right leg, including my glute. I was thinking that doing unilateral leg workouts as well as gluten imbalance workouts would help bring the other leg to par. I usually use my right leg dominantly, such as driving, etc. 

I’ve noticed my left leg to be weaker than my right when working out as well, so I’m pretty sure it’s an imbalance from just preferring my right leg in daily tasks. I wanted to know if this is an issue I can fix on my own, what workouts I can do, how long it should take, etc. Any advice is appreciated!

Neutral,"I have virtually no core strenght, and exercising abs is overwhelmingly hard  Background info: 24, F, reasonably active (I walk a lot!), have been doing some very chill strenght exercises for a bit, especially to develop my upper body. I had to start at basically zero and am just now able to do exercises with a pair 4,4lbs/2kgs dumbbells. Insanely low but it's real progress for me!

Upper and lower body are okay, but it feels like I cannot work out my core, and am afraid I will get hurt if I do harder exercises without core strength. Virtually every ""beginner"" exercise is too hard for me, I can't get into and hold the position. I cannot flatten my back to the ground at all, it keeps having a big arch in the lower back, and a lot of exercises where I need to lie down hurt my lower back. (I went to an orthopedic, but he was extremely unhelpful - noticed a lot of tension in lower back but told me it's nothing to worry about, he checked my spine and it's reasonably okay).

What I think I figured out is that, my abs are severely underworked because I tend to put all the strain on my lower back. It will hurt when I try to lift up some household objects - but engaging my measily core removes the pain. Recently I've been struggling with lower back pain more and more and figured I really need to find a way to get my core into shape! But where to start?

Things I found out I can sorta manage to do: Dead Bug (with a lot of discomfort because of the lower back not laying flat, extremely hard), Bird Dog (but I can only do a pair before I start to topple over), some crunches with my knees raised & feet on the floor (again lower back pain after a bit).

Is there anything else I can throw into the mix? Is that much discomfort in the lower back normal to experience while lying flat on the floor? Should I seek out a second medical opinion? How do I stay motivated while doing the same two basic exercises over and over and over? How consistent do I need to be with them, and in how much time will I see some improvements? I really struggle with being consistent, and not knowing what to look for is a big factor for it, but I struggle to find resources for people like me who start with toddler level core strength! :')"

Disordered,"Creating a plan  I'm trying to start a fitness routine. I've been at a bit of a loss because my goals have been ""be healthier"" and ""have more energy"", which are obviously not specific enough to guide my work outs. I spent some time pondering and also realized that I want to trust my body more (building body awareness). I started thinking about how I could achieve that and realized my goal. I want to be able to do bouldering. So a goal of completing a V0 path by the end of the year. Yay! Of course, there's no climbing gyms near me, but I can travel out of town at least twice by the end of the year (including a trip made specifically to attempt my goal).

In the meantime, I need to build up my ability to climb. The last time I attempted (like 15 years ago), I couldn't even get off the ground onto the holds.....

I'm 29 and currently 5'2 1/2"" and 240lbs. I can hang from a pull up bar and do a few shoulder shrugs. I can do less than 10 knee push ups if I only go about halfway down. I can squat for days though! I've previously attempted C2 5k, but had to stop because it was too high impact. I've done Stronglifts. I really enjoyed it initially but got stalled and frustrated. I was getting ready to reevaluate my program choice when we lost the gym membership (uni gym and my hubs graduated).

Disordered,"I Finally LOVE Fitness! - But is it too much Cardio and not enough Weights for my Goals?  So I (29F, 5ft tall, 135lbs) have been going to this really fun cardio class for about a year and a half now and absolutely love it. Its the first physical activity I've been able to stick with in my life and I've gone from a couch potato 20-something who could only run about two blocks downhill to a much more active and energetic person who rocks it out 3x per week in 1 hr cardio classes with some sparse weight training afterwards. Last time I checked I could easily run 2 miles to the gym and back and could go for more! Not a super impressive distance but woo, progress!

Sometimes the classes have boot camp activities or different weight routines thrown in too, but its mostly aerobic routines set-to music which target different muscle groups and emphasize good form, body weight holds, and an anaerobic ending followed by 10 mins of abs and stretches. The community here is also amazing to boot; its an all women's gym full of goofy, dedicated badasses with some D&D loving nerds like me scattered among them too, wonderful owners/instructors, and a very supportive environment.

Problem is, I feel like I have plateaued in a few areas and I'm not sure quite how to most effectively move forwards or if I'm doing something wrong. I worry that my goals are getting in the way of one another. My original primary goal was weight loss when I first joined, however, that fixation was sort of kicked down the road for a greater emphasis on improving my endurance, energy, strength and capability. My goals in order of importance are:

1 - Continually improve endurance and form

2 - Build muscle for strength and metabolism

3 - Lose fat, with the help of a diet structured around TDEE (not sure if I should aim for recomp, bulk, or cut?)

4 - Become able to do things I've always wanted to do, like pullups, multitudes of pushups, walking handstand, climbing a rope, hanging from and traversing bars with more ease

Question is can I realistically do all of this at once or are my goals conflicting with one another?

I've seen great improvements in my endurance and form, but less so on muscle gain, and much less so on fat loss. I don't want to put down my endurance goals, but I can't help but notice the other two are hardly budging.

I've been reading a lot lately that too much cardio can be detrimental for both fat loss and muscle gain, especially for shorter women, and I'm wondering if its at play here. From what I've heard, too much cardio can actually break down muscle gains and make you hungrier, causing you to want to want to eat more. I've heard that getting more muscle on your body is a great way to actually also lose body fat because it raises your metabolism, which for a shorter woman is especially helpful since we naturally have less muscle due to shorter limbs, thus a naturally slower metabolism, so kicking this up is great to do.

But, a healthy caloric deficit for weight loss is harder to maintain for short women due to a smaller window of allowance. Most online calculators tell me I need to eat less than 900-1100 calories per day on rest days to lose weight, meanwhile other sources tell me to never go below 1300 for metabolic health. A 500 cal deficit from my maintenance cals puts me in a metabolic danger zone, and I can tell you from experience trying to do 1300 or less leaves me incredibly hungry. For the last few weeks I've been sticking to a TDEE diet plan with 1800 cals, high protein, high carb, and low fat on training days, with a 1400 cal high protein, low carb, with a bit higher fat on rest days. It feels really good and healthy, and I like it a lot so far, but with no observable results yet.

So is all of this true? Is my amount of cardio per week potentially hindering me here? Or do I stay the course and just see what happens with the new TDEE, higher protein diet?

Or should I take some time away from cardio class to shift my focus and energy more heavily on weight training and my ability goals for a while to target muscle gain, strength, and fat loss before jumping back into my beloved 3x per week cardio? If so, any tips to spice up gym time to make it more fun?

Thanks for reading!"
Disordered,"How important is learning how to brace for beginner lifters?  Hi, been lifting for about 2-3 months and dabbling with machines and compound movements.
I hear a lot about breathing/bracing properly, especially for the squat. As I've increased weight for compound movements, I've tried to incorporate bracing. However, I find it very difficult to perform the lifts with bracing while simultaneously focusing on proper form, actually targeting certain muscles and tracking how close to failure I am. There's just too much to focus on during lifting and it's hard for me to concentrate anyway. It all feels very overwhelming.
Now, my question is: How much should beginners focus on bracing anyway? Is learning how to brace properly at the very beginning advisable? Do I risk developing bad (breathing) habits if I neglect bracing at this point? 
(I also tend to have issues with my lower back during squats and RDLs... Is it even more important for people like me to learn how to brace properly, in order to prevent unnecessary stress on the spine?) 

Thanks so much!"

Disordered,"Beating all-or-nothing thinking  I was a competitive powerlifter for years and now I'm not.  Due to the pandemic and moving, I didn't belong to a gym, didn't have a coach and didn't have a program and so I just kind of did  . . .nothing. I built a really good home gym and ended up working out for 90 minutes per day 6 days a week for a year and then  . . .nothing. 

How have you beaten all-or-nothing thinking when it comes to working out? Because I no longer can do 90 minutes a day all out (I have kids and a more demanding job and I just don't want to) but I also can't seem to make myself go work out for ""just"" 30 minutes. Any tips for getting over this?  Has anyone found a minimum viable workout? I want to be consistent, but so far I've just been consistent at ping pong-ing between all out and nothing.\* Any thoughts on how I can get to just doing something?

\*I shouldn't say nothing, because I still walk and hike with my dogs. I just mean formal exercise (lifting, running, rowing)"
Disordered,"Average Weight Progression for Barbell Back Squats  I know that this will vary from person to person based on a ton of different factors, but I’m wondering what the average progression for squats is for people who strength train regularly. For context, I’m 25, 5’2, and 160lbs, and I train my legs twice a week. 

I’ve been squatting at 165lbs for the past couple of weeks and am planning to up to 170 for my next session, and have decided to set a goal of being able to squat 200lbs by the end of the year. This time last year, my squat was at 95 lbs. This was about six months into taking up weight lifting - I’ve now been at it for a year and a half. 

**EDIT: As someone pointed out, I forgot to include set/rep range and load increase frequency! I usually do 3 sets of 10 reps, sometimes 8 reps if I’ve just increased the weight and can’t do the full 10 yet. I’d say on average I increase the weight every 2-3 weeks in 5 lb increments, but I definitely just go on when I feel like I’m ready to add more weight**

If I keep with that general rate of increasing this lift 70lbs in a year, I think I should be able to just make it to a 200lb squat by December. I am curious, though, if this seems like a normal rate of progression, or if any of that progress could have been due to ‘newbie gains.’ I don’t know a ton about that phenomenon and its duration. 

This all to say, I would love any input you all have on what’s normal/feasible in terms of progression with this lift, and I would love to hear about your progress and experiences, as well! Thanks!"

I have tried track, distance running, cycling, swimming, triathlons, soccer, paddleboarding, weightlifting, hiking, yoga, etc etc

I can't not compare myself. I try to compare myself to where I personally was before but it never lasts. I also feel like I either get burnt out or injured all the time. I just want to feel like I am doing a good job at something. It doesn't have to be great. I would like to have fun and feel strong.

Disordered,"Advice for training for my first half-marathon  Hey all, long-time lurker but first-time poster to the sub... Basically, every year I go to support friends doing the half marathon in the city where we live and I thought this year might be a good time to put myself up to the challenge. I'm just looking for a spot of advice on making sure I don't injure myself or go too hard on the training.

I have been running pretty regularly once or twice a week (occasionally three) for almost four years now. If it matters, I'm 27, 5""7 and around 68kg. My current routine is a 5km parkrun on a Saturday morning, as well as running once or twice in the week if I can - this is usually 3km. A year or so ago I used to do 5km on a Saturday and then 7-10km one evening during the week so that's what I had intended to bump it up to, and then eventually push my distances further as I got into the swing of the routine.

Yesterday I looked up a 12-week half marathon training guide and it suggested I do something more similar to a longer weekend run and two smaller runs during the week. I'm happy to do either strategy but I'm a bit worried that with so much running, my shins and ankles will be really sad about it! I've always struggled with shin pain (which I sort of gently pushed through and that usually works) but recently my ankles have been feeling under pressure from all the running and I was wondering if you peeps had any advice on how to deal with that and make sure I don't actually injure my ankles? Something like physio-style exercises to strengthen my ankles during rest days would work well, if anyone has any experience or suggestions? 

Many thanks in advance!! :)"

I'd like to get fitter by the end of September so to make the most out of my trip.

I'm not sure I can tell how intense an exercise the biking and jumping are but I do sweat a lot and I'm quite exhausted by the end of it, which is why I've been only doing 30 minutes.

Disordered,"""How many sets?"" (Rant)  It's not really a big issue, but a really subtle one. My fitness studio has a pretty big free weight area (at least in my opinion, haha) with three racks. One of them includes padding (right term?) for deadlifts. So, today I was doing at this particular rack my deadlifts (200 lbs at max). The free weight area got fuller and fuller while I was doing my lifts. The two other racks were used by two men. Guess who was asked two times consecutively whether I would be done soon? Right, me. They didn't bother to ask the two other rack users at all. This was definitely not the first time that happened, and does not have anything to do with observations of how long I was using the rack already: both guys just arrived in the free weight lift area and didn't knew how long each of us were at the rack, respectively. 

I'm just a little frustrated, because in these situations I get the feeling that I do not have the same right to be there than the guys. Did that happen to you too? Did you say something?

Disordered,"Anyone here 250+ lbs and able to do unassisted pullups?  I am a 43 year old woman just shy of 300 lbs and I have been training for the past couple months to achieve and unassisted pull up. I know it's a bit of a tall order but my upper body strength is pretty good and I have great coaches helping me train. 

However, I cannot find any videos of any other heavy women doing a pullup! Anyone have any leads? I will be sure to post once I achieve this milestone!

Editing for post length: My training plan is to work on pull ups for about 10 minutes a day, 5 days a week. My gym has daily classes for strength and endurance, and I usually blend my training into whatever their WOD is. The strategy is a different approach every day:

1. Concentric pulls (either seated and pulling up onto rings, or using a box under the pullup bar)
2. Ring Rows or Bent over Rows
3. Isometric holds at various levels of the pullup, currently with a box as assist
4. Ring rows or bent over rows
5. Slooooooooow negatives

I've been doing this for a month with one week off due to life. The immediate effect: Greatly improved push ups, feeling the development of my back muscles (and feeling them engage in my training), fast improvement on ring rows and the stated pulls onto the rings. 

The lead up to all this is my strength class did a ton of focus on engaging lats for various movements. Tons of rows. So it set a foundation for me.

It's so nice to have a challenging goal like this. I am a retired roller derby skater and this has reinvigorated my.... life, really. I love a good long shot goal. This has also piqued my interest in powerlifting.

Thank you for your encouragement and comments. I am not big on videos of myself, but I definitely want to record some examples of my training. Have a great weekend, all!"
Neutral,Breaking into fitness  I have never really been able to get into the habit of exercise. Most of my physical activity was from my school’s soccer season. I feel like I can’t relate to all the encouraging fitness people. I don’t get runners high my legs just hurt. I don’t feel refreshed and confident after excise just tired and sweaty. It’s never a good time which is really discouraging. My main motivation is to lose weight in my chest because I hate how disproportionate my breasts are to my body. I know you can’t spot reduce but I looked up exercises to help with that area and one that kept coming up was called “prayer pulses.” Whoever is recommending this to women with larger breasts is cruel. It is not friendly to my shape because I can’t complete the motion with arms in front of me like that. When exercises that should be common and universal don’t work for my body it feels othering.

I’m thinking of joining my local LA Fitness, mainly because it’s two minutes from where I live and I really love the variety of equipment and classes it offers compared to other chain gyms in my area. They have boxing equipment and a pool, which is great for me, as not many places near me do, and they’re the only forms of cardio I can usually stick with and fully enjoy.

I’ve never been “fit,” am overweight, asthmatic, and inexperienced with working out in general, and I’ve decided I want to make some meaningful changes for my health and happiness and want to take it seriously. So I’m very interested in the idea of getting a personal trainer that can help me tailor my gym experience to my goals, keep me on track, and direct me on how to approach my diet.

I’ve unfortunately seen a LOT of negative talk about LA Fitness’s PTs on Reddit though, and lots of people seem to post about it essentially being a cash grab and overpriced for essentially getting inexperienced trainers. I’m obviously hesitant about this, but a lot of the responses I’ve seen to these posts recommend investing in much, much more expensive personal trainers locally. I’m not sure I could afford that, would know how to find one that’s a good fit without spending a lot first, and I’d hate to pay for both my gym membership and a separate membership at a more expensive personal training place as well to manage both.

I suppose what I’m asking is, is a gym-affiliated personal trainer ever really worth it, and if not, how do you go about getting one? I use the JeFit app currently and am wondering if I should even seek out a PT at all or just continue with the app."

Especially for my lower body I often still feel a bit sore 3 days after my training. Not sure if it’s because my body doesn’t recover very fast or because I do other non-weight exercises in between. I do pole fitness and aerial hoop and do conditioning class at my studio ( it’s a lot of functional body weight training like lunges, hamstring curls in lunges etc), plus sometimes I do cardio on the stationary bike which also uses my legs. But even before I started doing all these other exercises outside of the gym I never felt completely “unsore ” 2/3 days after training a muscle group.

So my question is, can I train  again when my muscles are still a little bit sore despite it’s been a few days after training heavily with weights?"
Neutral,"Workouts using only machines?  Hi, to start off with i'm a guy (5'10, 158lbs) so maybe answers can vary compared to women, but i'm posting here because y'all on this subreddit seem way nicer than on the other fitness subreddits.

I've been trying to gather the motivation to go to the gym for weeks now, but when i actually go, the coach there has given me a 8 week workout program with just machines (and the lat pull down thingy but idk if that counts as a machine?) and my main reason for going to the gym is because i hate the way i look & i feel too weak. I've always read that machines are bad and all, but how true is that actually and how much effect will a 8 week machine only workout have on my strength and aesthetic, obviously providing my diet is in check?

10 minute cardio

Seated Leg Press (3x15)

Lat pull (3x15)

Seated Chest Press (3x15)

Sitting Shoulder Press (3x15)

10 minute cardio

A machine for your back where you basically go up and down but idk the name lol (3x15 too)"

Neutral,"Purchasing programs: your experiences, red flags, and the positives and negatives  Hello friends, I am reaching out to ask if you have had any experience when it comes to running lifting programs you have purchased in the past, and if you have ever purchased since.


After a year into my fitness journey, I have run GZCLP, Jacked & Tanned 2.0, nSuns, Layne Norton’s PHUL and PHAT, have seen incredible gains, and have decided to take it a step further.


I wanted to make sure that the person I bought the program from was knowledgeable when it came to training, so I took a long time debating on purchasing the right one. 


I decided to run Ana Katic’s 16 Week BUILD Program, and I’m honestly ecstatic that I finally made the investment, I was tired of following programs that were not very specific regarding tempo, exercise variations, etc. 


 I thought I would ask you all what subscriptions/programs you have purchased, and what you wish you knew before purchasing. 


Did you ever run a program that you really disliked? Or perhaps you bought, but didn’t follow correctly?

Anything you really enjoyed and felt confident with? Feats of strength or gains? Would love to know!"
Neutral,"can i turn from fat to muscular?  some things about me that may help in answering my question : i am 17, afab, im 169cm (5’7 i believe) , 97-100kg(213lbs,it depends because i deal with BEd), i dont know my body fat percentage but my biceps/triceps/quads are visible when flexed. 

my main goal is for my muscles to be visible without me flexing(especially my arms and quads lol). and im in doubt because for womens weight loss transformation pics  i see that the woman is not fat anymore and ive never seen a transformation where the woman turns from obese to muscular. 

so , when i do lose weight , will i end up not being muscular and that i have to bulk up when i am skinny to gain muscle? or is there any way i can turn from obese to muscular?

i lift weights 3-5times a week (schools been kicking me in the ass lately and usually i lift only 3 times and my workout intensity is not that high because i took a 2 month break) and i eat intuitively right now because i want to solve my BEd issues but i am aware of calories and i will sub out full plate of rice with half a plate and a lot of veges.

Neutral,"Cable Squat vs Barbell Squat - Weight Difference  Clarifying that I'm not looking for info on whether the barbell squat is a better exercise than a cable squat. My current gym does not have any barbells or barbell related equipment so I only have access to dumbbells and a cable machine.

I hit a plateau with db squats since my arms give out before my legs. It started to turn into a cardio workout with very high reps and minimal to none weight increase. 
I recently switched to cables and my lower body is finally feeling the workout at the increased weights. Specially glutes and hamstring (cable rdls). 

For people who do both squats what's the difference in weights you can squat using a barbell vs cable? I'm trying to figure out how much of the increased weight is due to the cable vs my ability to handle a higher weight.

Disordered,"Women's sports have different goals  I care a lot more about women's athletics than men's, and I have been wary of how people who don't care about women's athletics (both on right and left) enter into conversations about it when people like Lia Thomas come up. I think trans women in elite women's athletics is complex, though, and don't really want to talk about it here.

Instead, I've been thinking a lot about it, and I think that the goals of men's and women's athletics is just... different, a lot of the time, and I think people who don't care about it don't get it. It's not always super obvious - women are very, very competitive, love to win, train hard, etc. just like in men's athletics.

BUT STILL - I think there are subtle and incredibly important differences. Most notably, I think a big aspect of women's sport is the idea that our competition doesn't just raise the ceiling on ability, but that our competition raises the floor for all women. There's a collaborativeness to women's sports, a comradery. We do want to be the fastest and the strongest - but we also want to lift everyone up.

I think it shows up really well in women's running. If you don't already know, women's running (at least in the US, where I am most familiar) has made leaps and bounds in the last few years. I think Lindsay Crouse's journalism for the NYT has documented this the best, especially when it comes to 35+ aged women marathoners.

I think the difference is highlighted really well in her article on the Boston Marathon. This year, with freezing rain, women dropped out at a much, much lower rate than men: [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/opinion/boston-marathon-women-nurse.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/opinion/boston-marathon-women-nurse.html)  


All of this points to my title - that I believe that women want a lot of the same thing as men in sports, but also that the culture and the deepest desire of athletics is different between men and women. Women don't want just want to win - we also want competition that lifts everyone, seek out the endurance and journey of sport, and builds community. I think this is also why we have so many women who do endurance sports really well, and things like backpacking have a better gender ratio.

What do you think? I don't do much lifting - only enough to support my running. Do you see this in your sport, whatever it might be?"
Disordered,"once a week weightlifting routine help?  hi all! i’m wondering if anyone has advice for how to modify my routine to accommodate one weight lifting session a week? i’m in a bit of a weight lifting rut and want to prioritize running/walking/cardio over weight lifting for the summer, but i’m concerned about losing strength and potentially getting injured while i’m running. i’ve settled on committing to one day a week of weight lifting, and 3+ days of cardio, but i don’t know how to figure out what exercises to do.

previously, i was doing 2 sessions a week: session A (DB RDLs - single leg and standard variations, DB bench press, step ups, and DB rows) and session B (lat pulldown, DB incline shoulder press, some form of squat, lunges, and push-ups). i would also occasionally throw in a tricep-specific exercise or some ab work, but for the most part i think this gave me pretty decent coverage of the major muscle groups. i can’t fit all of those exercises into one day though. 

my question is, if i rotate each week (week 1 do session A, week 2 do session B, etc.) will i be able to maintain my current level of strength and prevent injuries, so when i’m ready to focus on weight lifting again i will be at the same level? if not, should i design a one-day full body plan somehow? any advice on this would definitely be helpful."
Disordered,"How do you know how hard to push/when to take a break?  This is something that I've struggled with for a while. When I was a kid, I did gymnastics and the mindset there was very much that your body is capable of anything and it's your mind holding you back. And that you should just push through pain to get better. Since then, I've been through over training and then recovering from that. 

So it usually switches between two things for me: either pushing through and going all out no matter what or taking it too easy because I ""deserve"" it. Whether or not I actually need the break or just want it, is what I find difficult to distinguish. 
So the main things are:
1. When do you stop working out in a session, for example, if you are feeling pain, lightheadedness, etc. Do you just take a short break and then continue when you feel a bit better or do you stop?
2. How can you know whether your body actually needs a break or whether you're just feeling lazy?
3. How do you decide between working out and getting more sleep when you usually just feel like sleeping more?
4. Should you push your body past what your mind feels like is enough?
For context, I sleep about 7.5 hours per night. Workout first thing in the morning for a hour Monday to Friday (at home) and the workouts vary from HIIT or weights most days. Weekend is rest days and I eat at maintenance. Main goal is just to be fitter at the moment. 

Also, sorry for any spelling mistakes, bad writing or lack of detail, I'm in a hurry and tired. Just let me know and I'll fix it.  
Thanks for all your help"
Disordered,"Understanding strength vs hypertrophy and aesthetics  I (f30) have been using entry level weights on and off for a couple of years but now lifting seriously for two month. My deadlift 1RM is only 80% of my body weight (body weight is 60kg, height 161cm) so far which I believe puts me firmly in the beginner category. During this time I have read up so much about fitness but somehow had missed the fact that there is a difference in training between gaining muscle vs gaining strength.

My questions are:

1. Does it matter for a beginner like me?
2. While I know that muscle building is gradual and not easy, especially for women, how much % of your body weight needs to be lifted to see some visible change or bulking up?
3. I also want to look good and toned but not bulk. Does that mean I should stay away from hypertrophy related workout plans where there is high volume? I was following nsuns workout which has high volume. 
4. I have fat stored in my upper arms (and thighs too but I am okay with that so far). So if I gain biceps and triceps it would look even bulkier without looking toned. But I also don’t want to do workouts which focuses only on glutes like strong curves (or is that not true?) Is there any workout plans that focuses on strength not hypertrophy? In fact I am not sure if I am even asking the right questions. And yes, I am trying to stay within 1300-1400 calories daily which kind of is a very slow long term cutting plan for me. 
5. I have a natural hourglass figure which gets lost whenever I gain weight and appears when I lose some via dieting. But I have also seen female trainers with toned bodies online and they all have somehow developed prominent oblique muscles that diminishes the narrowness of waist regions. Is there a way to preserve that while getting toned? Are there some exercises that I should not do?

I introduced my husband to gym and lifting (never worked out in his life and now loving it). So for now I am following the same routine as him. But I understand at some point we would need to diverge and he is already lifting more than I do even though we started at pretty much same time. Do suggest me workout plans for my goals. I am happy to add more details if necessary.

Update: someone aptly pointed out that bulking and being bulky are different not to mention it is subjective. What I meant here really in point 4 is just my arms looking disproportionately bigger compared to my body. Due to fat storage it already looks that way and it’s not just in my head because it’s been pointed out to me by a few friends too. And by toning I mean low fat %. Not too low but at least I should lose some thigh and arm fat so the faint curvy outline of muscle underneath shows."
Disordered,"Gaining muscle doing Caroline Girvan?  Thought I'd ask you lovely stronk women for some advice as a gal whose looking to get SWOLE.

At the moment I do 1 Caroline Girvan video 5 to 6 days a week whilst trying to progressively overload and lifting heavy. Due to my pretty inconsistent schedule I tend to just choose a video rather than following a specific program and as I'm trying to gain muscle mass I often do not do the cardio based ones and stick to the dumbell strength training.

However, I was wondering if this is really enough to make gains or if I should transition to a more so traditional weightlifting program that you'd find on fitness wikis? I workout from home but I've got a home gym with a squat rack + bar so I am able to perform most non-machine gym routines.

Also a quick side question: Would going on a bulk whilst doing the aforementioned vids be good for muscle gain or is the training simply not intense enough for it to be beneficial?"

I'd really like to increase my muscle mass, but I'm not sure what a realistic target is. At my age, does gaining 10 pounds of muscle over the next year seem like a good goal? (It would be nice to lose some of that fat too, but that's not my main focus at the moment.)

For the past month or so I've been following a dumbbell lifting program, and I'm hoping to ""outgrow"" my small weights soon and move to an adjustable set.

Disordered,"Race report - Grandma’s Marathon, Duluth, MN  So.. I thought I’d write this up here, rather than r/running. It’s currently 4am, the day after the race. My body did not want to sleep, so coffee+Reddit before I drive home :) First part will be about the race itself, then it will be about how I did at the bottom….

I ran Grandma’s Marathon yesterday, it’s a very popular race, this was race #43, it’s been going on since 1979. It’s very scenic, it’s run almost entirely along Lake Superior, from start until about mile 16-17  is lake side and it finishes in Duluth. Duluth itself is on the border of Wisconsin (Superior, WI is the sister city) and Minnesota and is a stunning town - very vintage industrial, gorgeous mansions, with a revived and lively lakefront recreational/shopping area. Tons of breweries, great food, lively and friendly locals.

There are 10,000 half marathon participants and 9,000 marathon runners. The evening before is a 5k as well, seemed to be popular, but not huge. The town itself expected 1MM visitors this weekend for race events - Duluth itself has less than 100,000 residents.

The half marathon is run before the marathon, both finish in downtown Duluth. The marathon starts at 7:45 am, busses or the TRAIN (yes, passenger train cars!) leave starting at 5:30am or so. The ride to the start was orderly, plenty of busses and efficient. The race start had TONS of portapotties. So many. Still there were lines. We had the singing of the national anthem, two F16s flew over, and we were off.

Aid stations every 2 miles to start, every mile at the end. TONS of local support and cheering. Lots of fruit (a friend got strawberries at an aid station, she said it was the best strawberry she’s every had), and tons of volunteers - I can’t understate the volunteer work that went into this. There were medic tents regularly, Vaseline stations, mobile medics, etc. On course gels were actually maple syrup - wild. 

Race was rolling hills, scenic and beautiful. No shade, very exposed, we had a nice breeze and it was warm enough to run in a tank and shorts (60F). The finish going into downtown Duluth was raucous. The temps started dropping fast and it was getting cold. Spectators were wearing hoodies and puffer jackets at this point. The last six miles felt pretty rough - I’m a trail runner and 20+ miles of pavement is hard on the body.

Finish was amazing. Tons of support, very organized. Lots of snacks- fruit, yogurt, bagels, milk, cookies, dill pickle potato chips (YES!). There was a blister tent. Mylar wraps (it was SO COLD at this point), shirts, and medals handed out. Downside - the shirts are lame and ill fitting. 

For post race - Duluth has tons of food options. We ate at Smokehaus. Pizza from Green Mill looked so good, and there are tons of breweries and pubs. The most pleasant part is that all seemed fully staffed, no waits, food was fast, it was kinda of amazing. 

So… my race. I was really hopping for a 3:50 marathon, 8:46 pace. I was pretty sure I could do 3:55 based on my training paces and miles and I KNEW I could do sub 4 hours. So much for that. I think I had a few things against me… 

1. I ran an ultra five weeks ago. Probably minor impact.
2. I have an ankle issue - I keep rolling it and it hurts. I also think I might have a stress fracture that is related. I’ll go to the doctor this week.
3. Covid. I had Covid, with symptoms (fever, chills, muscle aches, respiratory, etc), between races. I am not sure I’m fully recovered. I had a LOT of issues with pace in this race. I kept having to slow down to recover. I didn’t need to walk, but I definitely wasn’t at the pace I wanted or felt I should have been able to hold. 
4. Temps. the temperature and weather was perfect, almost deceivingly so. I think the cool temp and the breeze dehydrated me way more than I realized. My fellow runners felt the same. We were never sweaty, but I think the breeze kept us dry.

My end results… 4:20. 9:53 pace. Not what I wanted, but glad I had the experience and got it done."

you might just recognize me from, well, being on this sub all the time. i just finished up a major cut (with a major break in between). i wrote a little bit about it [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/rul3oa/sbs_hypertrophy_review_a_squatless_bastardization/) when I finished the first part of it at the beginning of 2022. 

as i mentioned in a previous post, i got a nasty wake up call re: my weight when i went camping last summer. i baked in the heat and i was super de-conditioned and struggled on mostly flat hikes.

##tl;dr

* total length of cut including breaks: 8.5 months (September 2021 - June 2022)
* weight lost: (as of this morning) 40 lbs 
* (flexed) progress pics: [before](https://imgur.com/a/mwS85r5) / [after](https://imgur.com/a/5ZTnw3k)
* goal: cut to 135 lbs ([graph](https://imgur.com/a/8u21wrd))

## About Me

cis lady. 29.5 years old. i competed in an endurance sport for 15 years through college (swimming). in college i was introduced to the weight room which sparked my lifting curiosity. when i hung up my goggles and became a ""swammer,"" i got more interested in lifting as a way to achieve my new aesthetic goals. (previously adding too much muscle was a concern since i was a distance swimmer). our lifting program while i was swimming wasn't very good. it essentially was linear progression the entire season which would gas me out for my later swim practice (we did two a days).

now i just lift. i went to law school with a solid gym and ended up working there while in school/while studying for the bar. i really started to get into lifting then. now i'm a tired attorney that built a home gym in my building's garage. at some point i'd like to compete in some sort of powerlifting comp, but i still don't feel safe yet going to comps while covid is still happening. i am also super fortunate in the fact that (thanks to union protections) i am still working from home. my job requires me to answer the phone and give confidential legal advice. i cannot be walking anywhere and talking calls for work. thus my job has me very sedentary.

thanks to doing a mostly non-contact sport i have a lot less injuries than most athletes. i have some hip issues and some rotator cuff tendinitis but otherwise it's pretty chill.

aesthetically, i want to look fucking jacked. i am not worried about looking ""too muscular"". i don't think the level of muscle i want is typical of most women want, so that might be something to keep in mind in terms of how i approached this cut.

## Methodology

in the past i've used RP templates and just straight up MyFitnessPal (MFP). i have cut as low as 1200 calories per day (don't do this) while still also lifting. last time i did a major cut i got down to as low as 120 lbs but was overall a bit dissatisfied with my physique. i was wondering where the definition i was expecting to have went. did i need to cut even lower? NO! 

i had cut too hard and lost some muscle mass in the process. some muscle loss during a cut is likely unavoidable but i had cut too fast :(.

i decided to give MacroFactor (MF) a try because i found that when i put myself in charge of my calories i would tend to overreact to losses/gains and swing my calories in an extreme direction. i decided it was worth it to me to pay for something that could handle all of that as long as i fed it info. i was a bit worried that weighing myself every day would make me obsess over my weight but it actually de-stigmatized weighing in for me. this will obviously vary depending on who you are, but i thought that was an interesting anecdote.

to be safe i set my goal rate to a bit below 1%/week of weight loss. i would have certainly hit my goal weight faster had i not taken nearly 2 months off during the winter holidays (Dec 2022 and Jan 2022), but not having to stress about it was worth it to me.

i'll admit that i was not always the best about giving MF data. that being said, i still got a lot of super useful and actionable information (for my diet) about my TDEE and my weight loss trends.

### Reflections

#### Choosing MacroFactor

i'll be honest, i went into this cut absolutely DREADING it. i have cut about this much weight before and i had gone too fast and lost a lot of strength/muscle in the process. also, last time i cut this much weight i was hungry ALL THE TIME. additionally, i was feeling a lot of regret because my weight got to this point due to a reckless dreamer bulk powered by work/covid stress. i was not looking forward to eating less.

i was already a fan of the guys at the Stronger By Science podcast and so when they mentioned that they were developing a food logger that also took a neutral approach to weight changes--i knew i was going to be interested. i did the 2 week first trial, ended up really liking the interface and its 'coaching' to adjust my calories as needed. i bought it for a year. it took a lot of the friction of doing a cut (crunching numbers, trying to change TDEE based on weekly data, etc) out of my hands and did it for me. i really initially underestimated how hard this part of cutting was for me until i didn't have to worry about it anymore. 

#### Diet & Hunger

i can count on one hand the number of times i felt really hungry and didn't have calories left. i certainly was not compliant every day or even every (i took a week long vacation where i didn't track and also took off nearly two months in the winter). i made some small changes to how i eat (less oil/fats in general when cooking), but i didn't feel like i had to meal prep to make sure i hit my calories/macros like i felt compelled to in the past. this was great for my household as my lovely girlfriend has no interest in cutting weight or really even lifting for the matter. i was able to cook ""real"" (i.e. not super weirdly healthy versions of) dishes that satisfied us both from a taste and nutrient perspective. i didn't want to have to only cook my own separate meals, and it was really important to me that we could still share the 'burden' of cooking.

my diet is pretty omnivorous although i am cursed with taste buds/a sense of smell that absolutely HATES eggs. if i hide eggs in things like fried rice, its fine. can i eat scrambled eggs straight up? nope. can i eat softboiled eggs? nah. can i stomach a simple sunny side up? no. how do i know? i have repeatedly forced myself to try different variations of eggs and sauces to try and choke them down. my mom and sister also have a similar aversion to eggs.

outside of the holidays and a few special occasions, i noticed that my drinking has gone down a ton. i am a BIG craft beer and bourbon gal. however, i noticed that even though i (still for now) don't get hangovers it still affects my sleep which ultimately affects my work/lifting performance. i wasn't a fan of that and so i cut down my drinking quite a bit. sometimes i would take the occasional THC/CBD edible to help me get to sleep if i was having issues winding down for the night. i'm not a great sleeper so this was huge for me. that being said, i certainly haven't cut out alcohol entirely. 

i did employ some strategies/tricks to help regulate any hunger that i had:

* don't eat in the morning until i'm actually hungry or about 10:30 AM (during my first break at work)
* if i'm choosing between alcohol and food calorie-wise always choose food
* don't drink your calories if you can help it! obviously this includes alcohol, but i think i only had 2 protein shakes in the last 8.5 months total. i feel way more full when i actually chew my food.
* try to sleep more. this is purely anecdotal, but i found on days were my sleep was less than great i would get hungrier faster.
* this is more for if you drink alcohol: if you find there are times where you habitually like to drink, it might be worth examining if drinking is really *that* integral to the experience. for me, later in the evening i like to play video games with my friends. i used to have a few beers or glasses of bourbon while doing so. did this really enhance the experience? not really, but i did just like having something other than flat water to drink. we ended up getting a sodastream thing and we make sparkling water with it now. i generally end up drinking sparkling water now instead of booze.
* have a large amount of veggies or fruits on hand in case you get hungry/snacky. might be a difficult adjustment if you're used to satisfying those cravings with other foods but i have no problems just quickly washing some strawberries or some spinach and chowing down on that if i'm hungry.
* on days where i know that i'm not going to be able to track well (e.g. i am eating someone else's cooking, going out to eat, etc) i'll try to keep my eating beforehand minimal but also still eat something. i'm the type that tends to overeat if i get to a certain degree of hunger.
* caffeine is probably also helpful for appetite suppression, but i use my morning latte as a nice thing i do for myself before work or as pre-workout for a lift. i tried to avoid relying on it for that purpose. sometimes i'll have a second decaf coffee depending on the day.

#### Lifting & Running

i also started running sometime in April. i haven't been super consistent with it because i took a break from running to save my legs for testing maxes at the end of SBS RTF. also i'm trying to figure out how to incorporate running into my new lifting schedule as for the last year i've been lifting 3x/week but now with The Rippler I'm lifting 4x/week. i lift on weekends and weekdays. on my week day lifts i try to lift during my one hour lunch that i take which has been working well so far. i've been unintentionally getting more conditioning here because i need to fit my entire lift in this time frame.

i somehow was able to make progress in some of my lifts. i hit a 7 lb PR in OHP and a 5 lb PR in my DL. bench unsurprisingly wasn't as successful but being in a cut seems to always tank my bench strength. i'm pretty confident i'll get back to one plate after a bit more training. running also (unsurprisingly) got easier when i started to weigh less, as there was less of me to move. lifting did certainly get increasingly more difficult as the cut progressed. i could begin to really feel the calorie deficit towards the end.

---

## Conclusions

i gain absolutely nothing from saying this, but if you're considering doing a cut i would strongly recommend considering using MF. it took a lot of the ""thinking"" out of doing the cut and i could just focus on inputting my data and going about the rest of my life. i'm very excited to keep using MF even as i begin to transition into maintenance (and eventually another shorter cut before the end of the year). i'm no longer afraid that i'm going to go off the rails and bulk like crazy like i did previously. i'm already planning out my next bulk and i'm actually excited for it.

i'm very happy with how i look and am looking forward to what i look like at 125 lbs with this level of muscle. i think i look better at 135 lbs now than i did at 120/125 lbs previously. i give a lot of credit to MF for not dropping my calories like crazy like RP and MFP did. i don't think my calories ever really dropped below 1400. the app got confused for a while and slashed my calories after i weighed myself post vacation but it did eventually recover to an extent. my TDEE is still trending back up towards ~2,000 calories a day. due to the life i've had previously about 85% of my weight training has been done while in a calorie deficit. due to the stresses of school/life transitions i would cut down to a low weight and then gain a ton of weight back and have to start again from nearly square one with my weight and lifting. i am beyond excited to see what i can do in the weight room while not training in a calorie deficit. my next major goal is a 2 plate pull (225 lbs) for deadlift and i'm somewhat confident i'll be able to add the last 20 lbs to that lift before the end of this year.

special thanks to the folks in the sub for being such a good resource/sounding board for all things related to fitness. being able to talk about my cut and lifting progress with y'all really kept me engaged in the process (a lot of my IRL friends are not interested in lifting/aesthetics)! i really appreciate this community and hope this write up gave something of value back :)"

Neutral,"Working out in the heat  Does anyone know how working out in the heat affects calorie burn or just working out in General? I live in Germany and it’s 90degrees F today/32 degrees Celsius. I worked out in the weight room of our workplace, and it was slightly cooler because it’s in the basement, but still HOT. I had to cut it 5 minutes short because I was feeling too fatigued from the heat. There’s no fan, no AC because much of the German population doesn’t generally have/use those things. Heading into a potentially hot summer, I’m thinking about how progress will look in the coming months if I can’t get through my workouts due to the heat. 

Is it better to do shorter workouts when it’s really hot? I obviously am trying to keep crazy hydrated. Does working out in the heat boost calorie burn so for something such as a HIIT workout its as effective as doing a longer one on a cooler day? Or do I just need to push through and get used to it?"
Neutral,"Heavy lifting in the morning?  
I really enjoy lifting in the afternoon after my body has been moving around throughout the day. Plus it’s a great after work stress releaser. However, I’m running out of time! I’ve got priorities that need tending to first so if those take too long my workouts suffer. 

I’m thinking about swapping my lifting to the morning. For those of you who swapped your afternoon lift sessions to the morning did you notice any differences? For some reason I’m nervous I won’t be able to pull as much weight. 

Also any tips for morning workouts is appreciated! I haven’t been an early bird to the gym in YEARS."
Neutral,"Does amount of sleep importance?  How much difference does the amount of sleep you get really make to your physical fitness journey?

Does more sleep mean you see better or faster results?

I am currently working on myself. I am doing my best to workout 5 days a week, drink 80oz of water (I used to MAYBE drink a glass a day) and get in lots of steps. 

I am curious to know how large of a role hours of sleep plays into my results. The maximum number of hours of sleep I can get a night is 5 and that is on a good night. Going to bed earlier or sleeping in later really is not an option at all at this point. 

Of course I know that it is still worth it to exercise, drink water and eat healthy, I just wonder if sleeping more really does get you to your end goal quicker.

I don’t just mean not losing weight - I’m not trying to lose. People say exercise helps with things like managing stress or sleeping better, and I don’t notice any difference in myself at all whether I’m working out or not. I’m sure I’m getting benefits (like cardiovascular health), which is why I want to keep it up, but it’s hard to be motivated when I don’t feel any different!

Neutral,"glute hypertrophy day added to general strength program  my current program is one of barbell medicine's 3-day ""low fatigue"" strength programs, with an extra day of my own design thrown in for some glute hypertrophy.  the low fatigue program is structured like: perform 5 reps at RPE 7, then do 21 more reps with the same weight- maintaining RPE 7 for each set.""  i really like this, and find that i'm more compliant with my program when i'm not doing sets in the 8+ RPE range most of the time.  the problem with the low fatigue program is that i also want to achieve some glute hypertrophy.  so the day i have added in to the program looks like this:

**barbell hip thrusts (or a hip thrust variation):**

10 reps at RPE 7, followed by 50 more reps- maintaining RPE 7 for each set

**banded hip thrust isoholds:**

6 isoholds, each held until RPE reaches 8+

**banded glute walks (or similar):**

5 minutes, timed

**banded hip abductions:**

5 minutes, timed

this day was designed taking inspiration from barbell medicine's bodybuilding program (the 60 reps of main barbell movement), barbell medicine's low fatigue template (the RPE and do x many reps part), and various glute programs i've read about and watched youtube videos on (exercise selection and isohold method).  the low fatigue program was designed with strength gains in mind, and i am not sure about the science of hypertrophy and the low fatigue programming concepts.  i realize that by adding in a hypertrophy day to a strength program i am likely increasing my accrued fatigue and somewhat limiting my strength gains, but i do have more than the strength goal in mind.

is there anything you would change about my self-designed fourth programming day?  i am 34 years old and 155lbs.  currently i'm trying to eat \~150g protein per day, while eating at a slight kcal deficit.  there will come a time when i eat at a slight calorie surplus, likely running a very similar program with the same goals.  i have been lifting weights for about 6 years now.  along with my lifting program, i also do 30 minutes of LISS cardio (just maintaining a heart rate around 130), followed by 30 minutes of yin yoga after each lifting session.  please, please allow me to post here- i re-wrote my post and tried to format it into paragraphs, and i really just want to discuss fitness.

thanks!"

Disordered,"Did my deadlift get weaker or was I just doing it wrong?  Well, actually I wouldn't say I was doing it wrong, but rather I was doing it in a way that wasn't optimal for my goals(strength).

After going through an overtraining period my squat suddenly got better. I managed to add 5 kg (90kgx4) to my previous record(85kg 5RM), but this time I left a few reps in reserve. Now, deadlift day comes and I try 5 kg extra to the weight I did last week for 3(95kgx3), So I try to pull 100kg, it felt really heavy, I could barely do 1 rep, so it's my 1RM. The interesting thing is that last month before I became overtrained I did 100kgx5, but it was touch and go and I did it sumo(even though I never noticed a difference between my sumo and conventional). Still, based on that you would expect I should be able to do at least 2 reps when pausing at the bottom.

Also, in the past I was able to add about 5kg to my deadlift every week, but I was doing more volume then. I was doing about 2-3 working sets and I was deadlifting 2x per week. I switched to 1 time a week because I wanted to focus on my squat more which I was only doing once per week. I also played around with working sets. First time I tried 1x5, then 2x3 as many sources claim that should be enough for deadlift if you do enough squats sessions.

Right now it looks like my squat and deadlift are the same(100kg tested 1RM deadlift and 100kg estimated for squats) which wouldn't be that surprising, because in the past they were about the same. It's just that recently it looked like my deadlift was maybe 15 kg more than my squat. Should I do more deadlift volume? Is it normal for the weight to fluctuate like this when switching from touch and go to stop and reset at the bottom?

Edit: I didn't come here to be judged for following my own program. I didn't say I am surprised for hitting a wall either. I just asked if more volume would be a good idea because some sources claim 1 hard set is enough. The fact I am asking doesn't make me clueless. Not everything is black and white."

Disordered,"Post-DEXA scan - need advice on my new regime and workout split  Hi team, 34f Aussie here (72kg, 170cm). I had my first DEXA scan last week and it came back with some interesting results. Namely that my bone density is on the drop and I need to get more calcium in, I’m pretty high in body fat (42%, which I expected) and my muscle density is quite low (this was a bit surprising to me).

Used to lift pretty regularly and got bored essentially and life and grief from a parent’s death got in the way and I really struggled for a while to get back to a routine. I’ve not really been able to shift the weight - I love food and admittedly I do drink too much. I know what I need to do from a calories in-out perspective but I’m a bit stuck on a workout split. 

When I was coming back to myself I tried a bunch of different things and for the last year I’ve been crushing spin classes - often in excess of 7 a week. I adore it. Which is why I guess I’m surprised there wasn’t more muscle under that fat as while I know it’s cardio it’s a fair muscle work out for me too, at least for lower body.

In the review of my scans I was told I really needed to focus on getting back to lifting - ideally the heavy compound lifts. I’ve also recently started pole dancing which I adore. I guess I’m trying to find the balance between doing what I enjoy and doing what works for me and I’m having trouble finding a sustainable split between my workouts. I’ll happily work out every day or multiple times a day if I need to and while I’d love to work in some yoga or Pilates every now and again too (though pole is good for stretch) I guess I’m conscious that everything I do that isn’t a heavy lifting session in the gym (which admittedly really bore me) is taking away from that muscle building and conditioning goal I really need to focus on.

I guess my question is, if I want to continue with pole (2x a week) and spin (minimum 3x a week), how reasonable is it to strength train 3x a week? Will it make much of a difference or am I going to be spinning my wheels (pun intended) and not progressing on muscle building with only three sessions? I don’t want to overload myself - I’m considering a PT once a week or so to keep myself focussed when I’m actually there and for confidence during those big compound lifts so I can go to failure, but I’m wondering if three sessions is going to be enough to have a decent benefit? Should I drop the spin entirely? Any advice welcome! :)"
Neutral,"What is a “significantly stressful” full body workout?  I’ve just began working out regularly a couple of months ago and am loving a mix of 45 min bodypump classes and my own lifting upper lower body split. Because of my weird schedule I often have to workout on days back to back (but always have 2-4 rest days a week). I saw the FAQ say that you should always rest for a day after doing “significantly stressful full body workouts” but my question is whether bodypump counts? I’ve seen lots of people saying it’s a lot more cardio/endurance due to low weights high reps. If so, can I train arms with heavyweights the day after doing bodypump despite having used my arms in the class the day before? I do get some muscle soreness still after bodypump but it’s not unbearable by any means, I just don’t want to negate any progress especially when I’m so new.

Neutral,"alternatives to walking?  this is a dumb post but what else can i do that is similar to walking. i used to try to go the gym and run 4 miles a day to get all my steps in but usually i would give up after at most 2 weeks. now im only doing 2 miles a day and it's a lot easier for me so i don't see myself stopping anytime soon.

however, otherwise im only getting around 2k steps. i like walking for 1-2 hours since it burns a good amount of calories for me, gets me to 10k steps, clears my mind, and is not too intense that i want to give up. however im not allowed to leave the house alone to walk because my parents think i'll be kidnapped (im going into 11th grade and we live in a very safe area).

what are low intensity activities like walking that i can do for 1-2 hours per day without getting bored and without leaving the house? should i just suck it up and run/walk 4 miles in the gym instead? my current goal is losing fat so i want to hold off on weightlifting for a few months."

Neutral,"Running just on weekends?  TL;DR: is it possible to build any kind of base, ~1-3 miles, by running just on the weekends?

I’m sure this has been asked before, but searching didn’t pop up anything obvious so here goes! The long version of everything is basically that the last few years have sucked. I used to run 10ks happily, but I got a desk job, COVID happened, 4 family members and my dog died, my current job is very stressful, and oh whoops now I’m fat. When I used to run, the first 2 miles always sucked no matter how fit I was. I want to get back into running, but I’d prefer to not be trapped forever in <2 miles and never getting to the good parts. I also don’t want to make this another expectation for myself—I’m not ashamed to say I’m on an emotional rollercoaster these days so I don’t need to make running a Thing(tm).

So does anyone have any thoughts/stories/experience with getting back into running but without having a training plan and just kind of winging it on weekends and trying to kind of “vibe” your way back into it?"
Neutral,"Help with Intermediate program  I'm not a beginner and probably not a novice either. I guess intermediate? Everything I look at makes me think it's geared towards beginners, which isn't terrible. This post was removed once, it was my first time posting here - I'm unsure of why I added more information and I think my post meets the requirements.

I've been lifting 4.5 years.

I'm 34, 5'0"", 125lbs.  I currently eat non-dairy and try to average between 1350 and 1500 calories per day.

I've read the FAQ and I don't see how my question is address there. I've looked through the recommended programs and I've tried most of them, except TLS, which is one I'm considering.

I've done:

NROL Strong (10 months) - loved this but I've tried to redo it over and over again and it just doesn't click

Stronglifts 5x5 - did what I needed, I need something with more ""other"" lifts, more deadlifts

Texas Method - worked okay

Strong Curves - did the advanced program, too lower body centric/not enough upper body

Jeff Nippards fundamentals of hypertrophy - did this before and doing again now, working well for me - looking at next.

I've tried but didn't stick with GZCLP and Nuckols 28 day. Didn't mesh well with me.

I have looked at Stephanie Buttermore's advanced programs, I have looked at Thinner, Leaner, Stronger, etc - I just don't know what to do next.

I can't do 5-6 days a week, which is holding me off on the Buttermore programs. I've heard great things about TLS. I currently do 4 days a week, I'd love to do 5-6 but with the economy and gas prices driving to the gym just isn't feasible.

Something else I should be considering?

EDIT: My goals are to continue lifting, Right now I'm doing hypertrophy and I'm enjoying the lighter loads. I am not pursuing powerlifting or bodybuilding at this time. I use exercise for my mental and physical health, doing something I enjoy that increases my strength and fitness is what I'm looking for.

Neutral,"What do you look for in a Personal Trainer?  I’ve recently joined a new gym that has a plethora of personal trainers I can choose to work with. 
Reading through all their profiles, I realized that I don’t really know what to look for in a PT.

On one hand, there’s their concentrations:

Behavior modification & motivation, bodybuilding, bodyweight training, circuit training, core & balance, corrective exercise & posture, cross training, flexibility & mobility, functional movement, injury prevention, injury rehab, kettlebell training, muscle gain, muscle definition, nutrition, olympic weightlifting, pilates, pre & post- natal, powerlifting, sports performance training, sports specific training, strength training, weight loss, wellness.

Their qualifications:

- American Council of Exercise
- National Academy of Sports Medicine
- National Strength & Conditioning Association 
- American College of Sports Medicine

And all the expertise levels, like KBA2 / Pn1 / FMS1.

On the other hand, there’s their “vibe”, or their personality, which is of course easier to evaluate after your first session than it is from flipping through the PT book or talking to a gym rep.

For a beginner, it can be quite overwhelming to figure out how to prioritize my own fitness goals in order to get some clarity on what I’d benefit from the most in personal training. 

What are some heuristics that you go by, and what has your experience with personal trainers taught you?

Neutral,"Should I join a gym or continue working out from home?  Hi ladies! 
I’m currently very conflicted on whether or not I should continue working out at home, or if I should join a gym. 

I primarily run outside and do free weights (I have a half rack, barbell and 350 lbs of weights at home) but would like the ability to access some weight machines (such as assisted pull-ups/dips, weighted crunches, torso rotations) and a nice treadmill when it’s too hot to run outside. Also, I’m finding I need a new routine - it’s often hard for me to workout daily when I’m at home. When I had a gym membership before I bought my free weight set, I’d go early morning and sometimes after work as well! 

Here are some pros of joining a gym for me:

- get ideas for new exercises and see correct form with the potential for feedback on my form
- access to weight machines that I don’t have at home (unless you know of substitutes with free weights, I’m all for hearing it!)
- more discipline in my routine 
- free fitness classes (I’m interested in yoga, Pilates, some cardio/weight)

Cons:
- the gym I’d join is quite warm (I did a free pass yesterday). I’m a big baby when it comes to heat lol 
- waiting for machines 
- inconvenience of dragging along gym bags, shower stuff 
- possibility of not even going and wasting money

So, if you’ve also been in this position and decided to exclusively do gym or home workouts, what did you decide and why? Thanks so much for your input!

UPDATE: decided to join a gym thanks to everyone’s advice! It’s been a week and I’ve been twice, and have done home workouts 3 other days!"
Neutral,"UPDATE: Fixing lopsided pecs  Hi gals and pals,

It's been over a year so I thought I'd make an update to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/ml8z3g/fixing_lopsided_pecs/).

**TL;DR: My pecs aren't really lopsided anymore.**

---

For context - I'm a trans man, I've been lifting heavy for over a year and a half. At the time of writing that first post, I'd been lifting for 5 months, was 10 months post top surgery and 8 months on testosterone, and I noticed that my chest was lopsided. The left pec was noticeably bigger than the right and it bothered me, so I asked the community how to fix it.

I got a whole lot of suggestions, here and on r/FTMFitness, which I'll summarise here:

(1) add unilateral exercises on the side that's lagging, like one-arm cable or dumbbell flys

(2) add additional single-arm burnout sets to my lagging side after I've finished my main sets with both arms

(3) do a warm-up/activation set on the weaker side

(4) use dumbbells instead of barbells

(5) check if it's really a difference in muscle vs left over breast tissue or fat

I was already doing (4) and my physio confirmed (5), so I had (1), (2) and (3) left to try.

(3) made no difference after a couple of months, and I found (2) impossible to do in practice (I'd have like 3 reps left in the tank after my main sets on my smaller side, even with lower weights, so I thought it wasn't going to make much of a difference), so I stuck with (1) for about 6 months. This did make some difference, and I eventually started doing the cable flys with both arms.

---

But the piece of advice I received that was the most spot-on was actually this, courtesy of u/Scrambledme:

> More broadly, just keep on working out and building your pecs as much as  you can with whatever exercises you like - if you focus too much on  imbalances (that are often not as perceptible to others as they are to  you!) and limiting work in your strong side to help your weaker side  “catch up” then it is quite likely that you’ll end up with less overall  growth than you would have had otherwise, and when your muscles are  generally bigger then small differences tend to work themselves out.

As my chest grew on both sides, the imbalance became a lot less obvious. It's now hardly noticeable - I've got recent pics on my profile if you're curious.

---

So, that's it for the update! Turns out that, sometimes, you don't actually need to do much to solve a problem.

Thanks again to this wonderful community, take care and keep lifting."

Neutral,"Adding Glutes to Thinner Leaner Stronger 1 year plan?  Hey lovely ladies,

I'm a newbie lifter (lifted for a few months a few years ago and got really into it but had to stop due to a complex twin pregnancy)  I've recently got back into lifting heavy and after dithering over Strong Curves (SC) or Thinner Leaner Stronger (TLS) I decided to go with the TLS One Year plan as I felt SC lacked upper body. TLS seemed like a more rounded plan, however I (like many) dream of building a big, round dump truck of a butt. Is there anyone who has done TLS 1 yr and modified it for better glute building?

So far I'm adding Hip Thrusts to the two lower body days and trying to add one or two glute accessories to any day I can fit them in.  Ttime allowing I try to do one or two of mostly either cable pull throughs, abduction machine or glute focused back extensions (although I'm looking at adding cable kickbacks and reverse hypers too).

I'm concerned with 

- A) Hitting glutes enough


& 


- B) Getting a rounded (pun intended) glute work out to hit and perk that underbutt, grow that shelf and shape those hips.

My current 3 day split (modified) is as follows:


**Monday** (Glute & Leg Day):

* 3 × Squat (Barbell)  
* 3 × Leg Press  
* 3 × Romanian Deadlift (Barbell)  
* 3 × Hip Thrust (Barbell)  
* 3 x Glute Accessories (various)




**Wednesday** (Upper Body & Core)

* 3 × Bench Press (Barbell)  
* 3 × Overhead Press (Barbell)  
* 3 × Lateral Raise (Dumbbell)  
* 3 × Seated Triceps Press  
* 3 × Hanging Leg Raises
* 3 x Glute Accessories (various)




**Friday** (Lower Body & Pull - Legs & Back))

* 3 × Squat (Barbell)  
* 3 × Deadlift (Barbell)  
* 3 × Bent Over One Arm Row (Dumbbell)  
* 3 × Lat Pulldown - Wide Grip (Cable)    
* 3 × Hip Thrust (Barbell)  
* 3 x Glute Accessories (various)

Squats are my nemesis, I struggle with achieving deoth and forward lean.  Thry just feel completely unnatural *as opposed to deadlifts and bench where my body just gets it?) . I'm forcing myself to just squat the bar at the moment until I feel more comfortable, I'm better with a very wide stance, feet turned out and plates under my heels but it doesn't feel good even if my form looks fine.  If I'm still not comfortable I may switch to Bulgarian Split Squats, can I still get glute gains with these?"

Neutral,"Help with modified PPL Routine for (restarting) beginner  Hi guys! I've started going to the gym about 2 months ago. I worked with routines set up by the trainers working at the gym I go to, as well as checking existing programs online. 

Largely everything was fine, however no trainer helped me address two main issues: *lack of mobility* because I'm inflexible but working on it (I can't properly squat, I've asked to be shown elevated goblet squats and was told it's cheating and to not bother), *position issues* (because of mental health reasons I can't do exercises where I'm lying completely horizontal on a bench).

**Me:** 24, F, 5'5 (167cm), \~198lbs (90kg), main goal is overall fitness and losing weight. Started C25K three weeks ago, going well!

**Experience:** I've gone to the gym on and off for about 6 years, but was never able to stick to a plan because I didn't like the exercises. I've now discovered how much more fun free weights are than machines, and I think this was my issue!

I'm not completely clueless, however I'm not secure enough to just yeet out a plan and follow it, so I'd love to know some advice! I made this PPL plan with the help of a few online ones.

**Concerns/Wishes:** I would like to only use dumbbells right now, since I don't find any flexibility issues in dumbbell exercises, and I feel a lot more secure and confident doing those. Also, I know that programs like GZCLP are great and include everything, but I've struggled a lot with those compound movements (because of the issues I mentioned earlier) and would like to work my way up.

Here's my plan (I would usually do \~3x8-10):

**PUSH**

Arnold Press 

Incline Bench Press 

Tricep Kickbacks

Lateral Raises

(Cable crossover, though have never used this before!)

**PULL** 

Bicep Curls

Hammer Curls

Bent over single arm rows 

Struggling with this day most, as a lot of exercises are on the back. :/

**LEGS**

Leg Press

Romanian DL

Hip Thrust

Elevated Goblet Squat (or a different variation of squats? I lack depth and ankle mobility)

Back extension (with a rounded back to target Glutes)

**Questions:** Which chest and back exercises with dumbbells can you suggest? Or something else entirely to target these? Do I have enough exercises? I read beginners often do too many.

So I've been lifting weights since 2017, will varying programs and aims. Since 2020 I kinda stepped down from 6 days a week body building split and just went probably 3 times a week and mostly did lower body stuff. It was nice to take a step back to be honest. 

I'm at the point now where I don't really enjoy the gym anymore and I'm not flush with money at the moment. I would love to just spend my membership money and time on another sport such as climbing and pole dancing, which I'm not doing for any aesthetic body gains, but that I really enjoy and I feel I'm good at. 

however the thing that I'm worrying about is that I'll lose my butt. My glutes have taken me years to build (they are by no means huge! Just normal I suppose), and I want them to stick around! I know it seems shallow, but I'm not prepared to give them up!

I am considering buying a sexond hand barbell and a few plates for my home so I can just do hip thrusts at home and am free to spend my time on other sports.

Do you think that hip thrusts alone (I do a few variations/ rep ranges etc) would be enough to keep growing my glutes or at least keep them sticking around?

Neutral,"Suggestions for transforming a sagging, pancake style butt  Hey everyone! As the title suggests, I'm interested in hearing your tips, suggestions, tricks, anything really - for transforming my butt. My weight does fluctuate a little over time, but generally I'm at a normal/healthy body weight for my height. I'm 36F, 5'2"", 112lbs currently. No matter how active I am, if I've been regularly doing cardio and/or weight lifting (including deadlifts, squats) - my butt has never really changed much in terms of shape and I'm just looking for some advice. It has always been (even since I was young!) sort of flat and sags - even when I've had strong and visible muscle definition elsewhere. I do have a history of knee issues (""runners knee"" - I've done physio for it, but apparently will always be a problem because of the angle of my hips to knees) which have limited how much progress I could make with lower body exercises, and rules out cardio options like running which have too much impact for me. 

For a little more context, the last few years I went through some awful mental health issues and because of it I was very, very sedentary during that time. I'm very out of shape and weak currently, and I know I will have to sort of start from scratch to build strength and avoid hurting myself by jumping in too quickly! I saw the Strong Curves plan mentioned in the FAQ of the subreddit, I guess I'm not certain what exactly I'm looking for (be it a routine/plan, or guidance on which exercises would specifically target the butt shape most efficiently).

I can't run anymore because my shins and joints hurt, and I'm too short to use my family's bicycles.

Disordered,"Nutrition for all day exercise?  I'm trying to figure out the right nutrition strategy for my workouts. Two days a week I lift and burn about 200 calories. Two other days a week, I play ultimate frisbee which burns 800 to 1600 calories depending on if it's a couple games or a whole day. All of this is tracked on my Fitbit with an HR monitor

I find that exercise suppresses my appetite, so I unintentionally eat at a huge deficit on tournament days and then am starving the next two days. This can't be good for my energy while playing or for my recovery

Disordered,"I never believed that exercise helped with anxiety...  I've struggled with anxiety my whole life. I started exercising regularly (lifitng, bouldering, running) about 4 years ago and in the most recent years, I've definitely felt that I've gotten better at managing my anxiety. I never attributed it to exercise though because I didn't ""feel"" different - I still overthink, worry alot and futurize so much. 

However, I've been sedentary for the last 6 weeks due to Covid, then tendonitis, then travel for a family wedding. And my anxiety has been SO much worse recently. Nothing else has changed in my life - no new cause to worry or no major life events. But yet I am waking up and going to bed with constant worry and a feeling of impending doom
 So the only thing I can attribute this to is the fact that I'm not exercising. 

I guess this is just to say that I have never realized until now that even though my anxiety didn't disappear with exercise, I was subconsciously dealing with it alot better, and there were less intrusive thoughts, and I was more peaceful. Exercise won't cure any mental health issue, but it certainly makes it easier to manage, no matter how subtle the difference might be."
Disordered,"Should you really not stretch at all before workouts?  I know it's recommended to do it after workouts, but I have noticed for me it's better to stretch before. Why? 

During conventional deadlifts I often have stiff quads or I am not sure how to call it. Basically, when I am lowering the weight I have a ripping sensation in my quads. Stretching my quads before deadlifts helps eliminate that problem for me. And yes, I do like 4-5 warm up sets for deadlifts, plus 5 min of cardio sometimes and it still happens that my quads are stiff.

I also noticed it may help during squats. I had some nagging pain in my hip joint, some stretching before squats helped alleviate the pain. My joint now feels better than before the workout. But for this one it may not be the stretching that made the difference.

Disordered,"How to improve lifting form when you’re overweight?  Hi everyone! I’m a beginner to weightlifting and I’d say I’m naturally pretty strong, so I love lifting. I know all the basics already (read through this wiki and others.) 

However, I’m having a hard time being able to improve my form, especially since I’m heavier and can’t get good visuals as much (f.e engaging my core is hard to see in the mirror or camera.) I also end up with some lower back pain so I know I’m not doing it right.

Those of you who currently are or were bigger, how did you improve your form within the limitations of your body shape? What resources should I use? What lifts or routines did you start with and how long did you stick to them? YouTube hasn’t helped as much as others have said it did for them because I can’t see it in myself.

Strength and stamina aren’t my issues here I don’t think, just the forms and picking exercises!

Edited to clarify I’m not looking for recs for more “beginner friendly” exercises like walking or body weight exercises, I’m past that point so I’d like to start working towards lifting specifically :)

Disordered,"5 months of working out and i still can’t see my abs  i’ve looked around on this and other subreddits but every “solution” to this question that i’ve found is something that i’ve already been doing which led to more confusion why its not working out

i’m 5’3 130lbs F. i started working out in january and gained 10lbs since then, even though i was eating in the caloric deficit the whole time. i don’t look like i’ve gained that much weight, i look leaner than before so i assume i gained some muscle, but my problem is that i don’t really see it. i’ve been lifting weights 3 times a week and i’ve been doing cardio 2 times a week (after every session i did like 8-10min of abs) but i still can’t see my abs. i was really in shape at the beginning and thought that like 5 months of working out and eating healthy (i try to eat 100g protein everyday) would be enough to get some musle definiton on my stomach but nope. my measurements are 33-25-39 if it helps anything 

am i doing something wrong? should i have done bulk first? what can i do better to overcome this?"

Disordered,"I am answering all your questions about what a WOMEN'S BARBELL is (and why most women do not need them)  Hey everyone! I'm a woman who trains regularly with both a women's bar and with ""men's"" barbells and I'm here to answer all your questions about what women's bars are, why they exist, who needs one, and the pros and cons of these bars. I will also discuss what women's bars are NOT (there are some myths floating around that we need to bust). If your question isn't answered here, please feel free to ask in the comments.

**TL;DR: Women's bars are specialty equipment for the sport of Olympic weightlifting (snatch and clean and jerk) and are also used in Crossfit for these lifts. If you don't train or compete in the women's divisions of these specific sports, a standard 20kg/45lb power bar is probably going to be more useful to you. This includes you if you're into powerlifting or just plain old noncompetitive strength training.**

## What a women's bar is

A women's bar, invented in the 1990s for women's Olympic weightlifting competition, is a bar that is:

* 15kg (33 pounds)
* 25mm in diameter on the grip portion (this is slightly thinner than power bars and men's Olympic bars)
* not knurled in the very center (knurling is that sort of diamond pattern of scratch marks that gives the bar some roughness to help with grip) 
* The same distance between the collars as power bars and men's Olympic bars, and thus fits just fine on standard squat racks
* Shorter in the sleeves, making it shorter overall
* *Very whippy*, meaning it bends and bounces more easily than power bars and men's Olympic bars

[Here is the IWF specification for women's bars](https://imgur.com/a/U8Fnd79), complete with measurements.

(Technically the sport of the snatch and clean and jerk is called ""weightlifting"", but here I'll be calling it Olympic or Olympic style weightlifting to try to keep things clear.)

## What are the other kinds of barbells?

* **Power bars** are a general purpose bar used in powerlifting and strength training. ([example](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-45lb-ohio-power-bar-black-zinc?gclid=CjwKCAjwtIaVBhBkEiwAsr7-cxGJAwzLypQRT0TmI0RWHVIwGa73sfm0e5fhxG-VAhPVnMoFoPTgsxoCkSoQAvD_BwE).) They weigh either 45lb or 20kg and the grip portion is  usually 29mm in diameter, but this may vary. They are suitable for squat, bench press, and deadlift for people of all genders. Some powerlifting organizations, like USAPL, use this type of bar for all lifts in competition. If you want a general purpose bar for your home gym, get one of these.

* **Men's Olympic bars** are similar to power bars, but designed specifically for the men's division of Olympic weightlifting competition. ([IWF specifications here](https://imgur.com/a/OykMRXe).) They weigh 20kg and are fairly whippy. (Not as whippy as a women's bar, but more whippy than most power bars). The grip portion is 28mm in diameter. If you see one of these at your local gym you will probably not be able to tell it apart from a power bar, and that's fine.

* **Deadlift bars** are used specifically for deadlifts. They are usually 20kg and the grip portion is 27mm (thinner than a power bar, thicker than a women's bar). They are usually longer than power bars and are quite bendy. The knurling is so aggressive it hurts.

* **Squat bars** are the opposite of a deadlift bar. They are extra thick and extra stiff and usually weigh 25kg/55lbs.

* **Curl bars and other small bars** are like mini barbells and usually have the same grip diameter as a power bar. Some are 25 pounds, some are 35, others may be different nonstandard sizes.

* **Miscellaneous** There are bazillions of other specialty bars (trap bars, SSBs, etc) not relevant to this discussion.

In a commercial gym, the kind with cardio machines and personal trainers, you'll typically find power bars for use in squat and bench racks, and shorter bars like curl bars that are used for accessories. Women's bars are not a typical offering.

In a powerlifting gym you will probably find power bars, deadlift bars, squat bars, and like a million different specialty bars. Again, women's bars aren't usually available, because they're for a different sport.

In a weightlifting gym or crossfit box you will typically find men's and women's Olympic bars.

## Who normally uses women's bars?

Olympic style weightlifters and Crossfitters who either compete in the women's divisions of these sports or who prefer a women's bar. It's common for women in these sports to use a women's bar for all their training. So if you walk into a weightlifting gym for a snatch lesson, and you look like a girl, you'll probably be handed a women's bar.

Personally, I use a women's bar for all my snatches, cleans, jerks, and related lifts, because I compete. I do most other lifts with a men's bar, unless I already have the women's bar out and then it's just a matter of convenience. Squats can go either way. If I did not compete in weightlifting I would not bother with a women's bar at all.

## Why do women in these sports use a women's bar? 


The main reason this bar exists is the whippiness. The bars used in Olympic weightlifting bend and bounce when they're loaded heavy enough, and competitors can [make use of the way the bar moves](https://www.catalystathletics.com/video/1406/Learn-Train-The-Bounce-In-The-Clean-For-Better-Recoveries/) to execute lifts better. A women's bar bounces at lower weights than an Olympic men's bar, allowing women to enjoy/use the advantages of bar whip at weights that are more typical in women's lifting. 

A secondary reason for the women's bar is the thinner grip. At 25mm, it allows for a more comfortable and secure hook grip by lifters with very small hands. Most lifters, including most women, can grip effectively on either bar--but we're getting to that.

Even if you don't care about the whip or the grip, you'll want to train on the bar you compete with. If you sign up for a weightlifting meet and you're in the women's division, the bar that's waiting for you on the platform when they call your name will be a women's bar. 

## Let's talk about grip

It's true that a women's bar has the thinnest diameter grip of any of the common types of barbells discussed here. 

And it's true that thinner bars are easier to grip for *pulling* lifts. (The same is not true for pushing lifts like bench press, where thicker bars are often considered more comfortable in the hands.) It's massively harder to double overhand an axle deadlift (50mm) than a deadlift on a power or deadlift bar (27-30mm).

So should you use a women's bar for your deadlifts and rows? I wouldn't seek one out for this purpose, but I'll be honest: I use my women's Olympic bar for deadlifts in my home gym because of the whip. It's like a poor (wo)man's deadlift bar.

But actual deadlift contests are not done with women's bars. USAPL uses a power bar for the deadlift. USPA uses a deadlift bar. Strongman competitions typically use a deadlift bar, power bar, or axle. I'm not aware of any organization outside of weightlifting or Crossfit that uses different bars for men and women in competition.

So if you want to get good at deadlifts, *practice on the bar(s) you will use in competition*. If you don't compete in the deadlift, or if you just like to fuck around, you can use whatever the hell bar you want.

## You don't NEED a women's bar for deadlifts

Ok, here's a pet peeve of mine. If a woman says they have trouble with their grip on deadlifts or other exercises, or especially if they have trouble hook gripping, somebody will suggest they use a women's bar. I don't think it's a good idea to seek out or recommend a women's bar for this reason. **Mainly because it can lead to an incorrect belief that other bars are ""men's bars"" and inappropriate for women's hands.**

Remember that most strength sports use the same bar for men and women. Yes, you can use the same bar as the bros. Also, the only bar properly called ""men's"" is the Olympic weightlifting one. Power bars and deadlift bars are gender neutral.

The thin grip on women's bars is specifically to allow more people to *hook grip* the bar. Hook grip, where the thumb is tucked (somewhat painfully) underneath the fingers, is genuinely *slightly* more difficult for *some* people with *very small* hands.

[Here is an article discussing the specific question of how small your hands have to be to be unable to effectively hook grip a men's Olympic bar](https://chineseweightlifting.com/hook-grip/#small-hands). The smallest thumbs in their sample of champion male Chinese weightlifters were 5.5 centimeters. I measured my own thumbs and if I'm measuring correctly (tbh I'm not 100% sure), mine are about 6 cm. My large husband's thumbs are almost 7 cm. My nine year old child has thumbs that are 5 cm, so we did some tests.

[Here is a photo of each of our hands gripping a men's and a women's Olympic bar](https://imgur.com/a/rCYlSPn). And [here is the same set of photos but with hook grip](https://imgur.com/a/k0n6tUW). He had never hook gripped before, but was game to try. These photos were taken with bars in a rack, hence the weird wrist positions. But you can see that we can both comfortably grip the bar. To make sure that this wasn't just wishful thinking, [I had him actually lift the men's bar, with both hook grip and no-hook mixed grip](https://imgur.com/a/iSV5mpx). He lifted the bar no problem and said his grip felt fine. (He has, in the past, done an over-bodyweight deadlift on a men's bar. He was younger then and his hands were even smaller. Grip was not an issue then either.)

So what about that 5.5cm benchmark? That was for weightlifters doing snatches. Snatches require a wide grip, making it harder to hook grip a heavy snatch than a plain ol deadlift. The link to the hand size article gets into a lot of detail about how to make the most of your small thumbs when hook gripping a snatch. Things like the position of your shoulders can make a difference and give you more room to play with. 

**Importantly, hook grip is a skill that must be learned.** I used to think I ""couldn't"" hook grip on a men's bar. Then I went to a weightlifting gym and learned to hook grip on a women's bar. Later--get this--it turned out I could hook grip just fine on a men's bar. The problem wasn't the size of the bar at all, but simply the fact that I hadn't figured it out yet.

## What to do if you have small hands and your grip sucks

Let's assume you just want to do normal deadlifts, rows, etc. You don't care about hook grip. But you have a hard time holding on. What else can you do besides switch to a women's bar? 

* Use chalk. Chalk dries up moisture on your skin (from sweat, for example) and gives a more secure grip.
* Use mixed grip. This means one hand has the palm toward you, and one has the palm facing away. 
* Consider practicing with a women's bar or deadlift bar to get a better sense of how to use your hands, then go back to your regular bar and try to grip it the same way.
* Use straps. Don't listen to people who say they're bad or cheating or whatever. They're a tool and this is an appropriate use. If your lifts don't feel as strong or as comfortable with straps, [you're probably using them wrong](http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2014/08/deadlifting-with-straps-secrets-and.html).
* TRAIN YOUR GRIP. This is especially important if you use straps. Straps and grip training complement each other really well. With these two you will be unstoppable. 

There is a really good deadlift grip routine at r/griptraining, as well as a basic routine that covers multiple types of grip. If you aren't training your grip, you should, and it's really easy to work into your regular workout routine. 

* In addition, if you do use hook grip, consider thumb tape.

## Myths about women's bars: lightning round

**Myth: Women's bars are good for beginners because they're lighter**. False: they don't exist for this reason and they're only 5kg (11 pounds) lighter. If you can lift a women's bar but not a men's bar, that is a temporary situation. In probably a few weeks you will be able to lift the men's bar. If your gym has a 25lb curl bar, a 33lb women's bar, and a bunch of 45lb power bars, then sure, work your way up. But if you're outfitting a home gym, do not buy a women's bar just because you're not ready for a power bar. You'll outgrow it immediately. 

**Myth: Women's bars are 35 pounds**. Nope, they're 33. You can round that to 35 in your training journal, but I want you to know the truth.

**Myth: Any 35lb bar is a women's bar.** No! There are 35lb bars that have the same grip thickness as a power bar and are usually shorter and stiffer than a women's bar. These are a different thing entirely.

**Myth: women's bars don't fit in a standard rack, or they are annoyingly short.** Nope, that's not a women's bar! Women's bars have the same distance between the collars as a men's or power bar and fit on the same racks. The difference in length is only on the sleeves (the part where you load the plates).

**Myth: this bar at my gym that's a little thinner than the others is a women's bar.** Women's bars are not only thinner, they are shorter overall. Instead of being about 7 feet long (220 cm), they are about 6.5 feet (201 cm). If you aren't sure if you're looking at a women's bar, put it next to a power bar or men's bar. It will be obviously shorter. (Another quick tip: if it has center knurling, it's not a women's bar.) If it's not a women's bar, chances are, you're looking at a 28mm power or Olympic bar and comparing it to a 30mm power bar. Or maybe you've found a deadlift bar. 

**Myth: I have small hands so I should use a women's bar**. See above: I really, truly would like you to rethink your assumptions here. 

**Myth: Women's bars are dumb and unnecessary, we can lift the same bar as men**. This is true if you're talking about powerlifting or general strength training, but that's not what women's bars are for. They're for weightlifting and they are a standard item in that specific sport. [When Mattie Rogers puts 300+ pounds over her head](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CeMvE7eAYSw/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=), the barbell she has in her hands is a women's bar.

## A final note

While I have argued that most of us do not need a women's bar, I must admit: there's nothing *wrong* with using a women's bar. If you don't compete and you don't mind that the plate math is more annoying (in pounds, anyway), you do you."
Disordered,"Feeling a bit frustrated  Been lifting heavy for a while now, pretty close to 2 years or more and have seen significant strength gains which is awesome and am super proud of. However, I started eating in a deficit mid-March and am down 13 pounds but am kind of disappointed in how much fat there still seems to be in my glutes. I haven't even taken too many pics cause I don't want to get discouraged and be so focused on how I look but it feels like it won't change. Should I just keep at the deficit?  Was thinking of ending it late June but now I'm thinking to just keep digging deeper to lose more fat. Fat leaves my upper body soooo much quicker. Not sure how lean I will have to get to really see a difference. I am 5'9 and weigh 148.

I love the idea of pilates and what it can do for your body, especially balance and mobility as I age. But I also want to get into ST (not heavy like a lot of you lift, but building up to a decent weight). I've read mixed things about combing the two, however.

Some people say doing pilates on your non ST days can lead to overtraining. I wanted to work towards something like full body ST 2-3x a week and pilates 2-3x a week, on different days, but I'm not sure if that's ideal or if I'm setting myself for goals that are unrealistic.

Neutral,"Morning Workout, Afternoon Sluggishness  Sorry if this has been discussed before—I’ve seen threads on fitting workouts into a busy schedule but haven’t seen this specific issue.

I work a busy job (think: investment banking/lawyer) with lots of fire drills throughout the day and an unpredictable end time.  On top of that, my commute is close to 45 mins each way. 

I would prefer to work out in the evenings after work, but with my schedule I don’t get back home in time for any of my gym’s later workout classes (My gym is 5 mins walking from my house). I also can’t really take long breaks during the day for a lunch workout.

So, I started going in the mornings to classes that start at 6:15 and end at 7.  Ideally I would do these classes (BODYPUMP, a circuit, or spin depending on the day) 3x during the week but some weeks it just feels impossible to get out of bed at 5:45 so I skip to sleep in (for a $5 penalty fee). I’ve also noticed that I’m much more sluggish on days I workout and find myself drinking several cups of coffee in the afternoons to stay awake.

Will waking up get easier over time? Will my body get used to the new schedule? Can I change something in my diet to give me more energy through the day?

I’ve considered just doing free weights/cardio machines on my own so I can have a little more control over my start and end time but can’t find a good 30-45 minute routine I like.

I’ve also considered switching to at home workouts but I’m locked into my gym membership for another 6 months.

Summer dawning on the Northern Hemisphere and my gym does not have AC. We have a couple large fans and open garage style doors. I'm usually very sweaty by the end of a class or session but now that it's warming up it's getting worse. I usually wear a tank top and some leggings and my go to to fight off the sweat has been a towel to wipe off with as I go and a headband to combat face sweat.

Disordered,"Is too much cardio bad for muscles?  I’ve spent several hours reading different websites and posts and I STILL don’t understand whether it’s bad or not 😭

If I understood it correctly, it’s mostly bad for those trying to put on muscles who do strength training if they don’t eat enough and are in a deficit. A lot of the fitness posts are also written by guys and for guys. So my goals don’t match anyways, since they’re talking about gains?

Does it mean that for girls who are skinny fat and just want ~~to become more lean and fit (not muscled, just toned like yoga/pilates folks)~~ **more definition** it’s ok to do a lot of cardio? If I eat enough to compensate (especially protein) and sleep enough to recover.

It doesn’t make sense to my brain that exercising more is bad if the exercise is gentle. I understand that lifting or running excessively can bring on injuries. But light cardio like elliptical and stair-treadmill ergometer is ok right? 

I do 2-3 hours of light cardio in chunks of 1h, because I have a lot of gym anxiety so this helps me burn calories in a non scary way for the first weeks while I’m getting used to my gym.

PS: I wasn’t trying to imply that I don’t want muscles because that’s manly or something, I was trying to ask whether excessive cardio is ok for me since I’m not working on building musculature right now. I’m sorry if I offended anyone!

Disordered,"On alcohol  Here's one kinda out of left field.  I've got a VERY coherent lifting and cardio program, and I've been seeing progress on it for years.  I also enjoy a glass of scotch or rum a few nights a week.  Certainly nothing even in the neighborhood of ""I'm a drinker,"" but yeah, alcohol is part of my routine.  I'm wondering if I can tweak my results by being more picky with when I drink.

Context: I do an 4-day split: upper horizontal A/B, legs A/B, upper vertical A/B, endurance cardio, repeat.  I wonder if placing my drinking on nights before my leg training, or after it, would make a difference?  Maybe not in such moderation, but as a thought experiment?

Disordered,"Balancing Marathon Training and Lifting?  Hi all! Has anyone ever maintained a regular lifting schedule while also training for a marathon? I’ve always prioritized lifting and really enjoy doing it/don’t want to lose all of my gains, but I’ve gotten it into my head that I want to run a Marathon in 2023. 

I ran my first half in April of this year, and found that I struggled to evenly balance lifting and running, I would always let one or the other fall to the wayside (and it was usually running, until the last two weeks of training when I basically cut out lifting completely). 

This time around, I really want to try to balance it better so that I can stay on top of both, and I’m trying to figure out the best split. During half marathon training i was trying to lift 5-6 days a week for about 1-1.5 hours a day, which just wasn’t do-able towards the end. I’m thinking maybe 4 days a week running, 4 days a week lifting, staggered so I do my heaviest leg day on a non-running day, light recovery run and upper body the next day, mid length run and maybe some kind of lower body the 3rd day, upper body and lighter run the 4th day, and then long run but no lifting on the 5th day? Or something along those lines? I know myself and have just accepted the fact that i struggle to get workouts in if i plan them for the weekend, so I’d like to do the bulk of it during the week if possible, but willing to make it work if I need to!

Has anyone ever managed to balance both, and if so would you be willing to share an example of your split/workout schedule? 

I have a while before the heavy training would even need to start (marathon wouldn’t be until November 2023 but i do have a half marathon in February and a few 5-15k’s scattered throughout the year) but I want to try to get into a rhythm early so by the time the heavy training starts I have my schedule down and am used to it!

Thanks in advance!"

Disordered,"Beginner runner, sudden race tomorrow, how to prepare?  Hi everyone,

I suddenly get to participate in a 5.6 km race tomorrow (an institute in my network paid for spots and some people couldn't make it). I used to run a lot a very long time ago. but only participates in races a couple of times. These days I mostly do Crossfit. I picked up running again about two months ago using the guided runs from the Nike run app. I do two runs a week, an easy run and either a speedwork run or a long run (long being like, 45 minutes). The guided runs really focus on running e-e-easy, which means I'm also generally slow, about 9 minutes per kilometer. I can do 8 min/km, but not for 6 km.

&#x200B;

I would like all and any advice y'all have on how to approach the race tomorrow! So far my mindset is on having fun first and foremost, but it's a corporate race, and I've never participated in those, plus I'm going to be together with people I don't really know, so I'm anxious, especially about being slow. In terms of specific questions I have:

1. Should I run today? My normal training plan included a speedwork run today, but I'm not sure if I should still do it
2. Should I try to run the race with the same effort as my easy runs? Or is it normal to try and exert more effort for a race? I'm afraid of being the last one to finish, and I like the idea of challenging myself a bit, but I don't want to crash halfway through the run...
3. In corporate races, is it expected that everyone from the same 'team' will run together?
4. Any little life hacks to make the race smoother?

&#x200B;

P.S. I would never be a person who signs up for a race on a day's notice without xxfitness, so I just wanted to state how thankful I am for this community <3

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I did it! I ran the whole time and finished in about 44 minutes, which was faster than I expected. I was partially motivated by the fact that my phone was dying and I needed it to find my colleagues after the race, but I'll take it :D We didn't run together as a group, thankfully, and it makes sense, two of the guys in my group finished at 21-22 minutes, so...

&#x200B;

Most importantly, I had a lot of fun! I enjoyed myself, challenged myself, and met cool new people :) I'm definitely going to do it again next year!

&#x200B;

The most helpful tip, I think, was to start slow and run faster if I feel like it later on. It was very tempting to try and match everyone's speed at the beginning, even though that's not a sustainable speed for me, and avoiding it let me speed up a bit at the end and, most importantly, not crash during the run. Thank you for your help, xxfitness!"

I am talking about men deciding they should give unrequested advice, which also turns out to be bad quite often. 

For example:
- A guy cam to me telling me I should wear gloves during deadlifts. I didn't talk to him prior to that. 

- Or a guy told me my sumo stance wasn't wide enough because he saw online that people usually keep their feet at x point of the bar(he did have some good advice about the shoes, but I only said I was ok with advice when he asked about giving me advice about the shoes) without considering that your stance depends on your proportions and height. 

- Or another guy came to correct the machine's position when I was doing chest flyes even though I was using the position the personal trainer recommended. 

- Or a guy who admitted not reading anything about exercising and doing his own experiments in the gym was trying to lecture me about my goals and what I will actually achieve with my current training style and proceeded to recommend another training style which would not be good for all my goals long term. And that wasn't the first time someone who was clueless about exercise tried to lecture me about growing too much muscle as a woman or what my goals are."

Disordered,"Trying to add weightlifting into schedule  I’m already pretty active. I’d like to add weightlifting into my schedule because I’d love a more muscular build. For reference, I’m 30 years old and last time I weighed myself I was 127. (Also not sure if it’s relevant but I’ve been eating around 2000 calories a day, give or take, with a protein goal of 100g) My schedule right now looks like this:
M: Pole class (usually leaves my upper body kind of sore)
T: Low intensity dance class 
W: Rest 
Th: Boxing 
F: Low intensity dance class 
S: Pole class and an active stretching class 
Su: Boxing 

I’ve been thinking about trying out strong curves, since it’s lower body focused and all of my current activities are pretty upper body heavy. But it’s also 4 days a week, and I’m not sure how I’d fit it in, especially since I’m usually pretty sore from the Saturday- Monday classes. My goal would be to get up early and work out so I can continue with my current schedule. I love my current set of activities because they make me feel much more present in my body than I usually am, but I’m pretty skinny/lanky with a bit of a stomach pooch that won’t go away(partially due to IBD). So I’d really like to start focusing on strength. But I genuinely have no idea where I’d add the training that wouldn’t wear myself out."
Disordered,"How to find time to exercise with demanding job?  I am a young teacher in a title 1 school. I used to love fitness, but now dread working out and literally force myself to do intense workouts during the week since I’m so exhausted after school each day. I get up around 5 am already to commute 45 minutes to my job, so morning workouts are out. After long days at school, I would often rather walk or nap than (for example) do a hiit class. However, my exercise guilt usually leads me to working out regardless and being exhausted afterwards.

My job will not get less intense in the near future, so I’m looking for advice for how to stay relatively fit while not feeling the guilt and pressure I so often associate with working out. I have no goals other than general health and maintaining my current body. 

Does anyone have any advice? 

Thank you :)"

Neutral,"Programs for handstands  Hi there. 

I would like to work more on my core and arms and be able, as a personal challenge, to do hand stands for exemple and other figures. I am a bit afraid of doing this and wondering how it’s even possible to do it since I have 0 experience in it. 

On the other hand I’ve been practicing yoga on a daily basis for 3 years but much more intensive since the last 2 months. Today I would say that I do yoga every morning during at least 40 min. I am really flexible now and already have a good general strength but I would like to go further. I guess there is some point where you don’t really know how to keep improving. I am also doing boxing once a week. 
Also, if I want to be persistent I like to have a « plan » in mind. Does someone ever tried the Core Play from Karin Dimitrovova? Looks really cool but I am a bit afraid it’s just bullsh**. If anyone has any other programs or advice I’d love to hear them.

Neutral,"Progressive overload limbo  I’ve been going to the gym for about 2 months now. I go 2-3 times a week mainly focusing on glutes and legs (I do Pilates & bodyweight for upper body). 

When I started, I was hip thrusting 4x12 at 50 lbs. I found it was getting easier for me so I increased my weights by 10 every 2ish sessions. Now I can comfortably do 90 lbs, 4x12 as well but I don’t feel it as much. So I lower my weights to about 70 lbs so I can focus on form but then it’s not as challenging. 

I’m constantly adjusting weight bc the 70-80 range isn’t challenging for me but when I go 90+ I find I start getting aches in my back, I don’t feel it as much, etc. I just feel like quality of the sets aren’t as good as lower weight. 

BUT I do want to do build muscle so I’m not sure what to do in this limbo. Any advice?"
Neutral,"PowerBuilding program for beginners?  Hello.
I've been messing around in the gym for some 3-4 months but I still consider myself a novice, since I've never followed a structured program so far and I still struggle with quite a few things (can't do deadlifts, for example).
Now, I've recently been thinking about finally getting on a proper program. However, I feel that most programs for beginners are either targeted at just gaining strength (SS, SL...) or training for aesthetics - my goal however is to both develop strength and grow muscle. I neither want a massive ass (not that anything is wrong with that) nor am I really keen on training in the 3-5 rep range 90% of my workouts. I have dabbled with Starting Strength type training and I found it mentally very taxing. Lifting heavy is daunting imo. Higher rep/volume training just feels more enjoyable to me, so I'd prefer  to incorporate a fair amount of training in the 8-12 rep zone. I also enjoy doing accessories, even if some of the training I do might be superfluous, lol.

An ideal training program for me would:
1. have heavier sets for Squat/Bench/OHP/Deadlift
2. have higher reps for most other exercises
3. incorporate a variety of exercises, not just the main lifts
4. ideally, help me improve my form or even guide me towards exercises I cannot do yet (OHP/Deadlift) 

Are there any programs like that out there? It doesn't have to be something designed by a woman or geared at women. I would be fine with anything as long as it is legit. 


Thanks a bunch!"

Hi, I'm about to start TLS program next week and I have done quite some readings and calculations to best prepare myself for the new journey.

Current Status:  
Age: 32F  
Height: 5'3  
Weight: 119 lbs

Goal:  
Reach about 110 lbs and BFR of \~20-22%.  
Get used weight training 4x per week.

Nutrition:  
I've used lots of online TDEE calculators including the adaptive spreadsheet and tracked my caloric intake. All the calculations seem to converge to TDEE = 1600 cal/day. Since I'm not overweight and also not looking for a bit cut, my goal is to eat about 1400-1500 cal/day. Regarding macros, I usually eat 85-100g of protein per day, and keep a 40/30/30 ration between Carb/Protein/Fat.

Training:  
As of now I don't have access to gym, but I do have a pair of dumbbells (max. 33lbs each) and a bunch of resistance bands. I've replaced BB exercises with DB, and the lat pulls with resistance bands. I've also replaced one leg exercises per week with glute centric exercise.

That's basically it, I'm excited to start the program. Please advice! Thank you."
Neutral,"is working out as a family a thing?  Before we had our son my husband and I used to work out together all the time. we’d go to kickboxing classes and lift weights together. I miss it. Our son is only 2.5 years old and most of our free time he’s around. Basically, we’re either working or parenting every waking moment. 

I’d love to get a good workout with my husband while my son is also around (obviously i don’t need my son to work out - his entire life is a workout, he basically never stops running around). But on the other hand i think it could be a wonderful influence for him, to see his parents break a sweat. 

we go on walks and do dance breaks but i want something more intense and more strength training. we don’t have a home gym or anything like that. So i’m really stuck and not sure it’s possible.

What sort of things helped you all out when you first started? Did you have a gym buddy to support you, or did you do it alone? What was a moment that really made fitness kind of “click” for you, that made you feel strong, or got you “addicted” to going to the gym?

I’ve been back at the gym after a while off for the past four months. I started weight training two months ago and I seem to be getting worse! 

Squatting is a prime example. I started doing 15kg (just the bar) with a PT to check my form. Two months on and I’m lucky is I can do 25kg! If I have two days off I can just about manage 20kg. My forms been checked, I’m eating well and I’m sleeping well.. any advice? I usually do 4x12. 

Protein is another issue. I’m aiming for 100g of protein but I’m vegetarian and have IBS. I’ve tried the supplements and they give me major cramps and bloating so I’m trying to do it with diet alone but on some days I can only hit 80g. Is 80g enough to see/feel a difference?

EDIT: I actually just tested positive for Covid today (symptoms started last night) so although I wasn’t feeling unwell, that might have been why I’ve been feeling particularly weak! 
Thank you everyone for the recommendations though - super helpful! I’m going to reduce my reps and try to slowly increase my weights. I might try upping my calories and see if that helps aesthetically as well! Thank you for all the diet suggestions; I need to up my tofu game!"
Disordered,"Can’t progress on squats from anatomy and mobility issues, any advice?  I’m relatively new to the weight room ( less than 6 months) and following TLS. I’ve been improving on all of my lifts (not just weight but also form) except for squats. I’m stuck because of my long femurs and ankle mobility. The only way for me to properly squat is to elevate my heels. But when I watch the videos back, I’m either not reaching parallel, or have a butt wink. So I’ve tried other things like low bar squatting, front squats, I’ve been doing ankle mobility exercises, stretching.. etc Nothing seems to help.

So I heard that low bar squatting was great for people with long femurs, I have tried it multiple times. The biggest problem is I have to lean so far forward for me to even try to get down to a real squat. Leaning forward literally at an 80 degree angle. Front squats really hurt my wrists, so I’m back to high bar squatting with plates underneath my heels. But my form isn’t the best doing those. And for anyone who says to try a different exercise, my gym doesn’t have a hack squat machine or anything like that. I also live overseas and the only trainers I could see would be at the American gym I go to, so I don’t have a lot of options and I’m not sure just the general trainers there would know how to fix my mobility issues. Please let me know on anyway I could possibly proceed, thanks!"

Neutral,"Met with my gym's trainer and I'm not sure how I feel about it.  This morning I had my first meeting with my gym's personal trainer, going through paperwork and doing a quick fitness test.

My goal with hiring a personal trainer is to strengthen my back to fix my bad posture. When I told him this while doing the paperwork, he kept on asking very specific questions, like ""which muscles in particular do you want to grow?"" and ""what is your specific goal? When do you know you'll have achieved this goal?"" and I didn't know how to answer, because, I don't know? That's why I'm here talking to you?

He then asked me to go through what I eat in a day. I told him I normally skip breakfast because I'm not hungry until closer to 11, at which point I'll drink a protein shake. Lunch is generally a chickpea salad. yogurt or fruit as a snack in the afternoon. Something more heavy for dinner, like chicken or spiced lentils with rice and veg or something similar. Then another snack an hour before bed.

He then told me I need more fibre in my lunch, and to add whole grain bread or lentils to it... It's chickpeas... it already has a lot of fibre? I rarely ever hit below the recommended daily fibre intake.

He also told me I absolutely need to learn to eat breakfast, because I need to reprogram my metabolism to work more efficiently. I feel like that is such an old-school mentality? I thought it was widely accepted that whether you eat breakfast or not doesn't really matter, so long as the rest of your diet is healthy. idk maybe I'm wrong.

The rest of the meeting went fine I think. He had me do some squats and push-ups and a plank. Tried to get me to do a pull-up, but I was like, bro, come on, you know I can't do that. He looked at my posture and had me move my arms around to check my mobility.

I guess I was just taken aback by him asking me what muscles specifically I wanted to work on. Shouldn't he be able to help me with that? I also wasn't crazy about his diet recommendations, but I may have just taken that more personally than I needed to.

What are your thoughts on this? I'm feeling a little bit inclined to not see him any further, but maybe I just wasn't prepared for what hiring a trainer entails?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments, I’ve read them all and will be going through to respond throughout the day. I’ve decided to dump this guy and get on the wait list for a physiotherapist. In the meantime I’ll be working on some of the exercises that were posted in the comments."
Neutral,"Least intimidating group fitness classes?  I am a runner, but want to start incorporating other activities for cross training and strength training purposes. I run solo and have always been a bit socially anxious, so I was curious what types of classes you would recommend for someone new to working out with a group. 

I’m fortunate enough to live in a city with several nearby choices: yoga, rock climbing, barre, Orange Theory, spin, etc. Are there any specific types of classes where both the instructors and fellow participants tend to be most supportive? Thank you!

For fellow socially anxious people, has doing group classes helped you overcome or reduce that in your life?"
Neutral,"40 minute 3-day program recommendations?  I’m a working mom and the only consistent time I’m able to workout is over lunch, three days a week. I drive to the gym and need to be back in not much longer than an hour.  This leaves about 40 minutes total for my workout (I do a small warm up before my first set and then continue to warm up during rest periods to maximize my time).

Does anyone know any strength/hypertrophy programs that I can modify to this length and frequency?  My goals are to grow my glutes in size and increase overall upper body strength.

Edit to add more detail:  I have been lifting weights for the last ~3 months, getting back into it after taking two big breaks having kids.  I’m 13mo postpartum so not needing any modifications at this point.  My current routine includes hip thrust, squats, leg press and deadlifts in a 8-12 rep range (usually) and push up/pull up variations in a 3-8 rep range + vertical press and horizontal pull for balance.  I’m not able to do all of these during 40 minutes, however, so I just kind of spread things out over the three sessions the best I can."
Neutral,"First rowing class today was not a success- what am I doing wrong?  As the title suggests I attended my first rowing workout today at Row House which I was super excited about. It was a 45 min class and the instructor went over proper form with me for about 10 mins prior which I felt pretty comfortable with. I also looked it up the night before to familiarize myself. It was a full class and half way though everyone was absolutely drenched with sweat except me. I barely felt any sort of cardio action despite keeping to the targets- it felt more like a muscle burn than anything. 

Now I do Peloton multiple times a week but I am by no means a superstar athlete or anywhere close and these folks were pretty fit so it leads me to believe I was doing something totally wrong.  Anyone have any tips for rowing they can share? I don’t know if I simply wasn’t pushing hard enough or I am missing something more subtle in the movements/execution. I seem to have the form down to some degree as the instructor commented a few times it looked good but I must be doing something else incorrectly. Appreciate any tips you have as I heard it’s a great low impact workout and I want to keep trying!"
Neutral,"advice on my program Shift  Hi, all! I hope it’s okay to ask this question this way.

I’ve been lifting for four years, and I’m wondering if any of you have had success with recomposition. I don’t really want to mess with my metabolism, strength, or gains. I love my curves, and I’m happy.

I am feeling a little less motivated since I’m at this happy weight and happy with this shape. I need a solid goal and some advice. I just finished a 6x per week program without cardio.

My plan right now is to continue eating high protein, intuitively, and to switch to a heavier lift schedule with fewer reps, and I am adding 10-15 minutes on the Stair Climber for cardio/strength on those six days, along with yoga nightly for peace. I’m also going to just write down my food and track macros to see where I am.

I don’t like looking at the scale, but I have this past week. I’m 5’5”, 152 lbs, and about 24% body fat. 

I’d like to lower the fat percentage, lean out my midsection, and keep my curves. 

Do you all see any problems with these minor changes? Any suggestions? I am looking for motivation and any advice. 

Update: I’m hoping to grow my muscles and stay about the same weight, also hoping that with a relatively low carb and high protein diet I’ll be able to lose a little fat while staying about the
same weight.
Thank you, xxfitness!"
Neutral,"Marathon Training + Lifting Write-Up: Jan - June 2022  Hi everyone! At the beginning of my journey I was scouring the web for advice on how to lift and train for a marathon at the same time but couldn’t find much. I’ve seen a few questions about it pop up on this sub so figured my experience could be useful for those who love the gym but want to run a marathon!

Background: I have been lifting consistently for over a year  (I got back into the gym after getting vaccinated last April), but lifted somewhat frequently but without training plans before COVID. I detailed some of that in my [last program review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/qah9sx/program_review_jacked_tan_20/)! I have been running on and off since high school cross country (\~10 years) but have always been very slow— I’ve done two full marathons in the last 10 years but both came in around 5:30. A lot of marathon training plans “encourage” strength training on off days but don’t give you much suggestion around it and they typically don’t even include compound lifts. I also don’t like running enough to run more than 3 times a week (if I could have trained for a marathon on 1 day running a week I would have 🤪) and I LOVE going to the gym to lift, so I decided to try to do a 3/3 split of running and lifting. The lift days were trial-and-errored until I found what worked, but ended up looking something like:

* Monday - Gym (Squat and Bench)
* Tuesday - Speed Work (training program linked below)
* Wednesday - Gym (Deadlift and Press)
* Thursday - Tempo Run
* Friday - Gym (Bench and Squat)
* Saturday - Long Run
* Sunday - Yoga (I like hot yoga) or walking

No notes on diet; didn’t track, probably ate too much, try to eat my veggies but sometimes I eat pretty unhealthy haha… although I do make sure I get enough protein. I don’t drink very often, though, and enjoyed being able to use my Saturday long runs as an excuse to leave early and not drink on Friday nights. I probably weigh around 160lb/72.5kg right now (at 5’ 9”/175cm) and probably did around January as well.

[**Marathon Training Plan**](https://www.marathon-training-program.com/three-day-program-finish/)

* Training started on January 25 for a June 4 marathon.  My half-marathon PR is \~1:55, and my marathon goal was 4:30, but I wasn’t sure how realistic that was so I set my “Key Run” pace goals for the above linked training plan to:  
   * Key Run #1 (Speed): 8:30 min/mi; 5:15 min/km
   * Key Run #2 (Tempo): 9:30 min/mi; 5:50 min/km
   * Key Run #3 (Long): Planned Marathon Pace: 10:30 min/mi, 6:30 min/km
* COVID: Tested Positive March 14. It was pretty bad for me, I was stuck in bed for at least three days.  
   * First workout after testing positive was on the 21st, ran on the 22nd
   * Was able to do a long run on the 26th but it was a bit slower than normal. No significant “long COVID” effects.
* Feedback on and Alterations to Training Plan: I thought it was generally a pretty great training plan-- I think that the speed and tempo runs were key to being able to push myself during the actual race. I ended up running the 20-miler/32k a week earlier than I was supposed to because I was travelling the week of it and didn't want to do such a long run in an unfamiliar place. 
* *Results/Race Report:*  
   * Came in at about 4:25, so I hit my goal! Maybe the next time I decide to do one I’ll put more effort into the running training and try to break 4 lol.  
      * Splits: 5k/31:49, 10k/31:12, 15k/30:20, 20k/29:59, Half/7:00, 25k/24:57, 30k/32:32, 35k/32:09, 40k/31:32, Finish 14:02
   * Weather: It was pretty warm throughout the race for a Nordic marathon— The stadium thermometer was reading 22C at \~11am before a 12:10pm start. I’ve been training in the Netherlands so the hot and sunny days are new to me. There were stretches that were right out in the sun, but typically once they started getting a little daunting we’d finally be under some good tree cover for a few kilometers.
   * The Race: I decided to stick with the 4:30 pace group. We started off pretty slow but between 10k and half started running some faster kilometers. I decided pretty early on that I would just try and stick with them as long as I could and then figured I might fall back to the next pace group. There were stretches where I pulled ahead of them, and in the last kilometer or so I fell behind and couldn’t catch up, but I finished within the same minute of some of the people I started with (including some young military guys!) which was an amazing feeling. Did not stop to walk (unless you count bumper cars at the water stations or my toilet break)!
   * The Course: not hilly as far as some races go, but for someone who trained in the Netherlands, there were some killer hills haha! There were some… weird hydration stations (coffee, Red Bull, cola, SOUP?!?!?!). I actually really enjoyed a salted gherkin I think a little over halfway? The Swedes are not as energetic as the Dutch when it comes to crowd enthusiasm, but the course was pretty packed the full way and we ran through nice and lively parts of the city which was key for keeping energy high.

**Strength Training**

* Ran classic 5/3/1 from January until the end of February but noticed I wasn’t gaining strength like I had been in the previous \~9 months, so I wanted to see if I could find something that would push me harder.
* I tried Boring But Strong— it was WAYY TOO MUCH with the running. I realized that, yeah, actually strength gains are going to be somewhat limited during marathon training and I needed to chill out and find a good balance between both.
* I switched to 1000% Awesome after I got COVID— I’m honestly not sure if I “ran it” correctly as I was just playing around with the KeyLifts app and saw this program was 3x a week and not insane on volume. I think the supplementary lift is supposed to be 85% but I typically lowered it to 65-75%  to save my legs for runs.
   * Monday: Squat/Bench + Triceps/Pulldowns/Kettlebell Cleans
   * Wednesday: Dead/Press + DB Press/Rows/BB Lunges
   * Friday: Bench/Squat + Flys/Pull-up Work/Single Leg DLs
* Results:
   * January 1RMs: Squat 1x75kg / Bench 1x 45kg / DL 4x100kg (I was nervous about tweaking my back so didn’t go for a 1RM).
   * Mid-May Maxes: Squat 5x72.5kg (probably around \~80 kg 1RM), Bench 5x42.5 (I think I could probably hit 50kg for one), DL 7x100kg. So, no crazy gains but steady progress considering I PRed my marathon by over an hour. I also didn't push myself on the deadlifts because I didn't want to risk messing up my running with a sore back.  I was considering testing my 1RMs next week but I think I might just wait until it comes up in my new program.

**What’s next?**

* Time for my annual summer “get your shit/diet together” cut where I finally have no travel plans for more than a month and can eat a bit healthier/meal prep. Hoping to lose 5-10 pounds between now and mid-August.
* Strength Training: Going to give Stronger by the Day a try. I know training plans are genderless but I’m looking forward to trying one created by a woman (and not having to play around with my programs/accessories at all). I just downloaded the app— it’s a bit slower and more buggy than KeyLifts but I like all the demo videos and how it has separate pages for supersets.
   * Hoping to hit 1 plate bench/2 plate squat/3 plate deadlift and 5 pullups in the next year or two.
* Cardio: Signed up for a sprint tri in September so going to focus on swimming. Will probably lift 4 days a week, swim once or twice, bike or run once or twice. After I finish the tri I think I'll give up on cardio for the rest of the year and focus on my strength goals lol"
Neutral,"Trying to switch up my routine for better success at consistency.  I haven't been consistent with exercise, despite trying to get back into it after a long hiatus. I used to be an evening workout person, so I defaulted to that, but I've just been too tired after work to do anything but a walk around my neighborhood or maybe so some stretching, if anything at all. I'll do a full body compound workout maybe 2 days and then skip the rest of the week because \*insert excuse/burn-out/fatigue here\*. Which, I suppose, is better that what I *had* been doing - nothing.

I thought about trying to work out in the mornings instead. Maybe if I just get up and do it and get it out of the way, I won't blow it off later. I know this will require an adjustment period and changing my sleep schedule, but I have the advantage of a basement gym, an ""office"" where I have enough room to do do yoga, and live within 25 minutes of both offices I work at.

I also have somewhat of a sinking feeling that maybe I'm just bored with my go-to workout - the aforementioned compound barbell stuff. I thought about trading it in for alternating body weight workouts (save some time breaking down/setting up/cleaning up my gym and I've been lifting for five years and still can't do a regular push up or pull up) with ashtanga yoga four days per week. I've been meaning to do more yoga anyway because I really enjoy it and I've read that it goes together with strength training like peanut butter and jelly. I usually avoid cardio, but plan to use my AirDyne bike more for rainy/crappy weather days and walk, hike, or bike on the nice ones. Gotta' be more kind to my ticker.

Did you cats who switched to morning workouts for accountability and time saving find that it helped?

Does my plan seem okay for my goals? Would you recommend anything else if I am, in fact, just bored and that's why I'm dodging my workouts?"

Neutral,"Non weight fitness goals  I've been going to the gym for the last 15 months with the ""hope"" of loosing weight. I know weight is mostly diet related so I am trying to find some good non weight related goals for working out. Working out is good for my mental health and stress levels. 

For my strength goal I think I want to do a pull up. I'm 30 years old and I've never been strong. How realistic is this? How long does it take to go from almost no strength to being able to do a pull up? 

I've got some money set aside to hire a personal trainer so I can make sure I have good form.

Can I get strong enough to do a pull up in a year? 

If it matters my current weight is 224. Gw is 150. But that's going to take a while. 

I'd also love to hear any other specific fitness goals!"
Neutral,"Seeking new program - Strong Curves, Lift with Sohee, Stronger by the Day, any others?  I'm not new to fitness but I'd like to get into heavier lifting (with some caveats, discussed below). My fitness journey consists of starting on gym workouts about 4 years ago with 3 days/week at the gym using mostly dumbbells and machine cardio, then with the pandemic I transitioned to home workouts doing 6 days/week using dumbbells for bootcamp style workouts or metabolic style lifting - Cathe Friedrich or Caroline Girvan, mostly. However, these types of workouts are not suiting me as well anymore, I find them too taxing on my adrenal system. As such, I'd like to start doing weight programs that allow me to set the pace and rest periods. 

Though I'm ready to move on from follow-along workouts, I will still be working out at home. My 'gym' is all stuff that can be set up and then tucked away during the day, so no barbell rack, but still quite a decent amount of stuff including:

- dumbbells ranging from 3kg-17.5kg

- a 120cm (4 foot) barbell that can take up to 110kg, with around 80kg in plates 

- weighted vest that can go up to 20kg (though to safely get it on I need to keep it around 12kg at the moment) - this could allow me to squat a bit more than whatever I can get over my head, though granted, not as much as if I had a barbell rack. 

- two adjustable kettle bells 

- door frame pull-up bar

- aerobic step to use for hip thrusts or step ups 

- stability ball

- lots of resistance bands/loops 

I'm considering Strong Curves, Lift with Sohee, Stronger by the Day, or any other suggestions? As a lady in midlife, I exercise to keep myself fit and healthy, maintain my weight, look good, feel good. So I don't have specific aesthetic goals per se. 

Any thoughts or advice would be welcome. For those that have done any/all of these programs, would they be worthwhile without a barbell rack? Are there other programs that might be more suited to the equipment I have? 

TIA!"
Neutral,"How to stay motivated to exercise for struggling exercise begginers?  I started working out at the gym this week with a personal trainer after not exercising at all for 3yrs and being just a lazy coach potato

My first session was supposed to last 1hour but the trainer stopped me at around 15mins in because he said I looked way too pale and I also felt I was about to pass out anytime. I had to sit about 30mins at the gym just resting afterwards before I felt okay enough to stand again and head home. The trainer ended up saying that this first session would be free of charge because I think he felt bad that it was so short.

My second session was earlier today where I felt dizy halfway through and ended up throwing up my breakfast in the middle of the session- luckily I was quick enough to run to the restroom just in time. I think I ended up only working out for about 25mins this time. The trainer asked me if I was pregnant but no I'm not, just incredibly weak lol

The trainer is incredibly accomodating and he lets me rest and slow down anytime I need to but I feel so bad though because I want to be better and push myself more because these first two sessions have been very discouraging and I don't know how I can continue if I'm this incapable with my body being so unused to any physical activity

Is there any advice you can give me to last longer to continue this and gain more stamina for working out? Thanks so much in advance

Edit: Thank you so much for everyone's input!! I'm still very clueless about fitness and working out so everyone's responses has been very helpful to me! 

I'll get a blood test done and go at a slower pace and start with some low impact stuff first to slowly ease myself into it. I'll also try to skip eating anything heavy before working out and see if that will help me not feel sick. Thanks so much everyone!!"
Neutral,"Bodyweight skill training vs general weight training?  Hi! I hope this is appropriate for a seperate thread, sorry for the lengthy post. I'd like to hear your experiences with this.

I'm 22f, 155lb/70kg and 5'8/173cm. I've been weightlifting for abt half a year now. I'm wondering about the approach to doing pull ups, dips etc., which seems to be commonly ""do negatives/do the skill more to get good"".

Some context: before I started I couldn't do a push up, then one day I tried and discovered I can do a push up with some effort, yesterday I tried again and turns out I can do five pushups chest to floor with no effort whatsoever (feels like doing bodyweight squats aka like nothing). I have not trained specifically for pushups, but I have been consistently progressing on my bench (34kg/74lbs for 5x3reps right now, so about half my bodyweight). I tried to progress from elevated pushups before (years ago) and it didn't work for me.

Now my question: I've always wanted to do pull ups. I train negatives, scap pullups, banded pullups etc, I'm now at half pull up (cant do the top half) so yeah it is progress. But I'm wondering, would it be better to just focus on lat pulldowns, barbell rows and deadlifts, get stronger and the pull ups will come along just like the pushups did? Or is it different because there isn't really an exercise thats as similar to pull ups in terms of mechanics as bench is for push ups. The bodyweight progressions seem to be geared more towards dudes, and while I know it CAN be done, is it optimal for the typical AFAB natural lifter?

Tl;dr: does skill training/bodyweight progression make sense for upper body (pull ups, dips, push up) for women, or is it better to gain foundational strength from lifting (where it is easier to increase the weight slowly)?

Edit: just to be clear - i do both pullup progressions and regular exercises like rows, lat pulldowns etc. lots of good encouraging advice in the comments! thank u <3"

Neutral,"combining classes with solo lifting program to see results?  I am 30F/5’6/142. Been lifting for 10 years with pt, solo weights, and classes mixed in. 

As much as i try to stick to a lifting program, i always catch fuckarounditis and lose motivation. Instead, strength-based cross training classes 3x a week keep me consistent mixed along with 1 reformer pilates and 1 hiit class. i’ll also throw in 1 solid gym lifting day for good measure (it’s all i can muster on my own). So that’s 6 days of workouts and 1 rest day. 

I am struggling because i go through varying levels of exhaustion. i’m not seeing leanness over time. is this a good way to see progress? i’m not a fitness professional so it feels like i’m “winging it” by combining these at random, but it’s the most feasible and consistent habit for my lifestyle. The strength based classes are on 4 week cycles and utilize progressive overload so i figured i’d see progress."
Neutral,"Burnt the heck out. How long did it take you to find your mojo again?  I find it ironic I'm posting this a few days after kicking off a discussion about rest *days*. Now I'm wondering about rest weeks. Consistency is not something I struggle with; I have worked out 6+ days a week (with the occasional 5 day/week) pretty much every week...forever.

I've mixed up my routines a ton for both physical and mental benefits (former elite athlete retired from competition in 2017...since then I've had a strong aversion to one specific goal, and I'm fine with that. I'm training to feel good and say yes to anything. I run, mountain bike, lift, do the occasional class like Barry's, and climb. Depending on the volume of each I'm around 8-12 hours/week (running more = less volume, but higher intensity).

I've found over the past several months I am feeling burnt out far more often than I ever did before. I never felt that way for more than \~2 days and would always get back to it (often feeling mentally fresh, but honestly never had that physical freshness people talk about from taking rest days...).

Now I'm finding this is happening much more frequently. Before my period, during my period...and I'm just starting to think it's cumulative burnout. I'm still going for long walks, stretching/foam rolling, etc but it's been legit impossible to imagine going to the gym, running, going to a class, doing any real exercise. I'm also very hungry, so I've stopped eating in a deficit to see if that will help but I'm still just tired. This is so foreign to me. I've never taken an extended period of time off except for breaking my shoulder \~9 years ago...

I guess all of this to say, how have other lifelong athletes/fitness enthusiasts dealt with this? Should I lean into the fact that I want to do absolutely nothing but lay around, eat more, walk the dog or just workout but reduce the intensity? Lastly, have you found some benefits from doing a reset (eg: endorphin reset)? I'm noticeably more depressed from not working out, but I also think it's important to not rely on *one* thing to feel better.

Ya'll are awesome, TIA.

EDIT: totally overwhelmed by the comments, advice, and support. This is the most positive experience I've had on this sub and it has helped a ton. I really hope others can glean something from this too. So much to think about and implement. THANK YOU ALL!"

Neutral,"Tips for pistol squats?  I used to be able to do pistol squats after doing zercher squats and hack squats at 180lbs. I stopped doing them because when I do hack squats I feel like I’m arching my back improperly and I stopped doing zercher squats because the crease on my elbows had the veins scarring.

I now do press squats on the machine and leg curls. I can do 200lbs but I still can’t do a pistol squat. Can you give me any tips on how to scale it so I can start doing this awesome leg exercise. 

Also when I stand my legs are straight and not bent. I think it’s not good and I want my legs to be more loose. I also have flat feet too. Is there ways to improve my leg posture?

Neutral,"are flexibility and mobility the same thing?  I do Olympic weightlifting and my coach told me my biggest limiting factor in his opinion is my mobility (I have the classic office worker hunch and tight hips)

He recommended I focus on mobility and recommended two programs called mobility WOD and ROMWOD. 

I go to a nice gym with yoga and Pilates classes (have only done the yoga ones - I like hot yoga) and wondered if that would help me with my mobility? Since I already pay for them and there's more accountability showing up to a class, I'd prefer that. 

Everywhere I read about yoga and Pilates, improved flexibility is what is emphasised and I'm confused - are flexibility and mobility the same thing in this case?  Anyone have suggestion on if yoga or Pilates it better for improving mobility (particularly tspine and hips)?

Plus still to shy to use the barbell at the gym. So I decided to buy one instead. However, I still need the gym for other workouts I need such as the machines. 

For instance, the cable kickback, hyper extension, lat pull down, seated row, leg press, leg extension, standing calf raise, chin up., and assisted tricep dip. 

So my question is, is it bad to split my workouts up into two? Doing my barbell and dumbell workouts  at home then going to the gym later in the day to do one or two machines I’m missing out plus fast-walk on the treadmill?"
Neutral,"going every day to the gym to get into the habit?  so, i went to the gym irregularly in the last years and by that i mean that i went every few months or something like this. i run every now and then, but i also can't mantain the habit to do so. :/ i know that my mental health benefits a lot from it, but it is a struggle to do it.

i am currently loosing weight. i've been on the upper end of the overweight bmi range, now want to get into the normal range and then getting fit and lean. i understand that i can lose muscle while being in a calorie deficit and i want to mantain them and optimal would be body recomposition.

the main problem for me seems to be turning going to the gym or excercise in general from something i do when pumped up or emotional or whatever to something i do regularly. the last time i mantained a running habit i went every morning. so i would like to go to the gym in the morning every day i have classes.

would it be possible to go 4 days in a row?i would like to do it monday to thursday, so those days would be structured the same and then don't go from friday to sunday. i totally understand that it would make more sense to spread it out but i feel like it would be easier to build the habit this way. one idea i had was that i could do some days where i only run on the treadmill and don't lift weights, maybe taking turns.

Neutral,"Working out haphazardly—no programs/routines  I’ve always hated “working out” (ie, the gym/working out outside of an activity like skiing, hiking), but this year found consistent enjoyment in VR; the Supernatural game has been incredibly helpful for me to keep me consistently moving (highly recommend for other cardio haters!). 

With the help of the consistency from Supernatural, I’ve also recently started up some at home strength routines using dumbbells/easy home equipment. Stacking habits, I guess!

Well my question about the strength training: I have tried and failed to follow full on programs like Sydney Cummings. I enjoy popping one of her / others’ videos up depending on what I’m feeling any given day. But following a day to day program is impossible for my lifestyle.  

I see a lot of you talk about following a program and being more diligent about things like tracking progress, progressive overloading, etc. and honestly that is just more than I want to handle!

So, is it fine to just randomly choose workouts without these details? Will I have poor results (my goal is to lose fat and sleekly tone up) or more critically am I risking injury? Any advice you have for how to do this less structured approach and still get good results?

I recently started working 10 hour shifts at work from 7:30-6:30 with rotating days off during the week. I’ve been to the gym a couple times after 6pm and it was so packed it was just not enjoyable so I started going before work at 5:30am but I HATE IT. 

I like that the gym is quiet and if I need a squat rack there’s probably one available but I am just so low on energy early in the mornings and I hate trying to make myself go to sleep by 10pm so I can get a decent amount of sleep. I’m also dead by about 10am which sucks because I work a boring desk job so it’s easy to just doze off. 

Yesterday was my day off so I had time to make some coffee, eat a banana and relax before my gym workout and I had such a great workout compared to today where I just wanted it to be over. 

Early birds, am I missing something here? Do you wake up early enough to eat something before a early morning workout?

Neutral,"Not sure how to improve “oomph”  I generally enjoy workouts. I’m plump, but not too much, and it’s obvious I have muscles under a little layer of fat.  I guess I am fat fit.  

I do cardio most days and strength training 5 days a week. I have a sedentary job, so I have to sit all day. 

When I workout, I have the strength to do the exercises.  I choose the proper weight to challenge me while still maintaining proper form.  I have the mental motivation. I just don’t have that physical push.   Some people call it “oomph.”  Maybe it’s power or just plain energy.  I don’t know how to improve it since I really don’t know how to define it.  

An example, I can’t make my body do box jumps. Or really any kind of jumping.  Kickboxing is another thing I struggle with.  I can do the punches and kicks, but I am really just doing the motions.  There’s nothing behind them.

Disordered,"""Where are all the Female Participants in Strength, Hypertrophy, and Supplement Research?"" - new article at SBS  [Link to the article](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/representation/)

Greg Nuckols at Stronger By Science recently published at analysis primarily looking to assess two things:

1. Are female lifters underrepresented in resistance training research?
2. In general, do studies with female lifters systematically differ from studies with just male lifters?

Some interesting takeaways include:

* Yes, female lifters are underrepresented in studies. This was **particularly** true of the most practical/everyday types of questions about things like training volume and frequency, as opposed to more niche topics.
* The trend appears to be getting worse, not better
* In general, there don't seem to be systematic differences in studies that include female lifters. This leads Nuckols to conclude that for many research questions, scientists should recruit mixed-sex cohorts rather than restricting their study population to one sex.

There's a bit of an interesting line to walk here - it's *probably* true that most results from studies done exclusively in men apply to women as well, so when making decision making about programming/supplements we shouldn't assume we need to train/consume differently. But the lack of inclusion of women means that any differences that do exist may go undetected. And of course, ""in general"" doesn't mean there won't be specific areas where important differences do exist. 

I'd love to hear general reactions on the analysis from the community, but in particular I'm curious about a few things:

1. Are there any specific research topics with little to no research on female lifters that you think very well could show important differences?
2. Are you a consumer of science-based fitness content (whether you are digging through PubMed yourself or following particular writers or influencers who discuss training-related research), and if so, how do you decide when to incorporate something into your training/eating/etc?
3. In your own experience, do you feel like trainers/fellow gym-goers/content creators make un-founded assumptions about how you should train based on sex/gender?

Yesterday I tried using it for the first time and realized it is seriously tilted. I’m not talking a slight incline on the edges. I literally have to be super careful climbing down from the top of a corner where I set my water bottle, for fear of falling and hitting the railing (it is suspended over a basketball court). Like I’m tempted to use my hands as well as my feet to get down from the edge.


Can someone tell me why it is tilted so steeply and if it is okay to use for walking/jogging as a novice? I woke up today with my whole body weirdly sore and I’m assuming it’s fro my body not being used to correcting for the steep curves.


TLDR: Why is my gym’s running track deeply tilted and is it okay to use for a casual runner/walker?

Disordered,"How to structure 3 runs/wk without any particular goal?  I am only able to run 3 days per week due to my schedule and I don't have any particular goals now that I've hit a sub-30 5k. My priority through this summer is to focus on lifting and building muscle, but I'd like to still make my runs count for *something*. 

I've been running for about a year and I usually do two easy runs (one 3-4mi, one 6-8mi) and an interval session (1 mi warm up and cool down without about 1ish mi of speed work). I hate intervals and I think I'm going to remove them from my schedule - I dread them and they discourage me, making me more likely to skip the run altogether. However, I don't want all my runs to just be easy runs.

Could I add a 2-3 mile ""comfortably hard"" run and still be somewhat improving? I know I'll plateau if I don't increase my workload, but upping my mileage isn't really feasible right now, so I need some kind of challenging day to make up that 20% hard of training.

If my 5k PR is 28:14 and my easy pace hovers around 11:00-11:30, would running 2-3 miles at 9:15-10:00 once a week be effective in seeing some improvement (even if it's slow) or is it a waste of time?"

Starting weight: 160lbs 

The first pic on the left is from March 16, 2022 and the last is from April 27, so about 6 weeks. 

I got back in to working out through a program at the YMCA called coach approach, which is really motivating to keep me on track. I started meeting with a physical therapist for some back pain which got me in to lifting. I’m currently 22 days in to the Female Training Bible. Those exercises + strengthening my glutes and core with PT exercises have been life changing for my back pain and posture. I know it’s not a huge change but I can def see a difference in my posture, plus I feel great! 

Diet:
I eat relatively healthy. Whole grains, plenty of veggies, no soda, or junk foods. I cook at home a lot. I start my most of my mornings with a protein shake (currently using TopBit) However, I eat socially & love cooking for others so I’m pretty unwilling to cut calories or avoid foods while I’m out just to watch my weight. 

Workouts:
My PT started me out doing banded glute bridges, rear foot elevated Romanian dead lifts and pallof presses with a band. I’m now doing heel elevated squats with a kettle bell, banded Russian twists for my core and goblet Cossack squats. Cossack squats are very challenging for me. 
After 3 weeks of these, my back pain has significantly reduced. I mix those exercises in with the workouts in the female training Bible on the lower body days and try to do them at least 2x a week. Along with that Im also doing 20 mins of moderate cardio 4 days a week after lifting. 1 day a week I do 45 mins of cardio. My cardio of choice is usually the ERG or a spin class if I’m really feeling up to it.

I want to continue to get stronger to help offset damage I’ve done by having an office job where I sit all day long lol.

I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/u84sq1/squat_form_check_please/) here about a month ago asking for a squat form check, and I got a lot of helpful advice. Since then I feel like I've made a lot of progress in my squat form and depth, but I thought it might still be a good idea to post again and see if anyone else has any additional tips. My current program calls for a day of low rep heavy squats and a day of high rep lighter heel-supported squats, so I wanted to include both since it seems to me like my depth is not always quite as good on the heavier squats, even thought it has improved quite a bit over the past month. Please let me know if you have any recommendations or advice, or if there's not much  I need to change at this point!

Disordered,"When are glute band exercises no longer useful?  Background: 5'4"" 16F, relatively new to lifting, maxes are S: 62.5 kg, B: 27 kg, D: 80 kg

Before I started lifting, I would do 3 Bailey Brown YouTube videos with a resistance band every day: [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yODhAdefv8&ab_channel=BaileyBrown), [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6ZXoZwRrY&ab_channel=BaileyBrown), and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdpRRafYsaI&ab_channel=BaileyBrown). They're pretty much just banded glute activation exercises: donkey kicks, lying hip abductions, and quadruped hip extensions. When I started lifting, I just never took them out of my routine, but I do them in the morning and I lift in the afternoon, so I don't know if they actually work as activation. All 3 videos take about 30 minutes.

Since I've been doing them for a year now and can no longer progress in terms of resistance, are they no longer useful? I'm hesitant to cut them out in case they've helped prevent injuries or led to increased glute activation while lifting, and because [Bret Contreras](https://bretcontreras.com/your-optimal-training-frequency-for-the-glutes-part-i-exercise-type/) found that banded ""pumper"" exercises 6 days a week led to substantial functional muscle size.

Mid-Follicular - cardio, interval training - use a kettle bell

I try to front-load my hydration during the days so I don't have to bee during the night (damn you, bladder), so I do drink quite a bit early on.

I’ve found a handful of exercises I like in addition to the 3 power lifts, and I do a similar number of sets each session, but the weight varies depending on how I’m feeling.

I know I’d get better results if I were more consistent, but none of the professional programs I’ve looked at have the right mix of strength for competition and glute hypertrophy. Strong Curves was too high-rep and doesn’t target the main lifts enough, but all the other tried-and-true programs seem to be designed for men, neglect glute exercises, and don’t take into account that we have higher stamina and can benefit from higher reps.

Another issue is that I have a hard time sticking to the progression. Sometimes my energy is higher or lower and I don’t feel capable of lifting as heavy. I don’t want to waste my time at the gym, though, so I try to do a lot of sets at a lighter weight. I’d rather just get in the set volume at a weight I know I can lift than fail and have to cut the set short. Is this working against my goals?"

I am an 18-year-old 5'4"" 150 lbs female. I have always been on the squishier side and I've been ready for a really long time to start changing my lifestyle. I am trying to do research about the best ways to go about losing fat and gaining muscle, and everything I find is highly confusing. It's frustrating because I have been trying to incorporate cardio into my routine several times a week and am eating around 1600 calories a day, eating higher amounts of protein than carbs and fats. Yet nothing is coming off and there are no changes in my measurements.

Some recent research I've done suggests that the best way to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time is to minimize cardio to a few times a week, eat at a maintenance caloric intake, and start a progressive strength training program.

Does anyone have advice or tips for me? I am trying to do this on my own with no professional intervention and I know little to nothing about fitness, but am wanting to make big changes! What is a ""progressive strength training"" routine? How do I make one suited to me? Do I need to continually buy new and heavier weight sets?"
Neutral,"Overcame the weights section fear for the second time in my life - and you can too!  Ten years ago I bought The New Rules of Lifting for Women and spent about four weeks psyching myself up to step into the free weights section of the gym. When I did, I loved it. I stuck to the program for a good while and really noticed improvements.  


And the story of my life - it fell away. Over the following years, I dabbled in running, yoga, bits of strength training (with machines and kettlebells), put weight on, lost it again, etc.  


This year I got back into running and working out. Although I'm still overweight, the focus this time has been on long-term overall health instead of weight loss which has helped motivation massively. But when at the gym, I just couldn't find the confidence to go anywhere near the free weights section. It was even more annoying knowing that I had overcome that fear before!  I looked at loads of programs and kept saying 'tomorrow', but it never happened. Until it did.  


Thanks to the wiki on here, I found the 'before the barbell' program on Instagram and it was the perfect reintroduction. The program is great because it slowly introduces bits of equipment - so it's not overwhelming. On my first day on actual free weights, I arrived at the gym basically at opening time so that there wouldn't be anyone else around!  And as soon as I got into it, it was like the confidence came flooding back. And every day after that I've been striding up to the weight bench area without a second thought!  


If you're in the same situation, I highly recommend the program. You'll find it @ beforethebarbell on insta!"

I’m 52 years old and about although I’ve lost 80 lbs. in the last 3 1/2 years, I am still about 25 lbs. overweight.  I’ve been working my ass off at the gym for the last 16 mos.  and I just completed my first sprint triathlon.

In my head, I’m just another fit person working out like all the other fit people but obviously I stand out as someone who needs a thumbs up to keep encouraged.  He might as well have said, “way to go old, fat lady!”

Because of the demands of the job, I'm standing the entire shift, and I would say I'm walking around for about 3 hours as a low estimate and about 4 and a half as a medium estimate. I also have to carry trays and clean and fill stock in between serving tables. 

I've also been trying to get into shape, as I noticed I've become fluffy where muscles used to be. I just come home extremely tired from my job. I had the thought of using my job as cardio and then doing recommended weight exercises to tone the fluff and lose weight. However, I'm not sure if this is a good plan, or if I should be doing additional cardio at home as well. The thing that's making me question the work as cardio thing the most is that there is a small amount of time when I'm standing still (taking orders, waiting for food) and I'm not moving at the same pace the entire shift, so the calorie burn is probably different every hour.

5 days per week. 6 exercises including supersets. Compound focused. So far doable—great actually!—even if 5 days per week makes me go :/ initially.

But then I looked at the actual workouts: everything is 4 sets with 12 reps+. She has leg presses in there that are 4x20, deadlifts 6x10. 

Does this not seem a little intense? I don’t mind 4 sets (6 is too much imo), but 12+ reps in every exercise seems a bit much to me. Is she going for the high volume = muscle growth theory? Or is the goal to lift lighter and stick to high reps? I can’t imagine going heavy for an entire workout of 4-5 sets that are each 12+ reps and following it with 20 minutes of cardio.

Should I reduce the reps and/or sets? Thinking of cutting back to 4x8-10 and changing some to 3x10-12 instead of all of this volune.

Disordered,"How much does gender affect potential for muscle mass building?  So, if you look up muscle building as a women or read any article that relates to women weight lifting, they really drive home the point that it won’t make you big and bulky. I know there’s plenty of women who don’t want to lose any sort of their feminine figure, but frankly I do. 

I honestly don’t know if I’m trans at this point in my life. Even if I was, I’m not in a place to take T or really do much about it in a medical sense. But either way, I’d prefer to look as masculine and big as I can. I’d rather a slightly higher body fat with more size than skinnier and less mass. I was a successful, high level competition athlete and despite never doing any real weight training, I was always considerably stronger and more muscular than my teammates. So maybe I’m already slightly more predisposed to build muscle. 

I guess it’s just hard to figure out how much gender affects ability to build mass. I watch some women weightlifters occasionally, while they are clearly super strong they don’t always look that way. Then there are other women who have huge arms, legs, etc. And obviously who knows who is on PEDs, but I feel lost on what expectations I should realistically have, and it’s been hard to find research based information on the subject."

But I feel like it’s not enough days to show results, hence why I’m considering doing it at home. I will have to save up quite a bit for a while to purchase the weights etc, but I’m afraid my lack of progressive training at home would hinder my results. 

So, my question is, should I just continue going gym or purchasing weights & working out at home? 

TIA!"
Neutral,"How long does it take to recover from overtraining?  This is a bit odd in my case because I was only training 3x a week. However, I didn't take into account that when you train for strength you shouldn't reach failure all the time. I was seeing progress from training hard for a few months, but my nervous system probably got better at lifting heavy weights, so I was probably not as close to failure in the beginning as I thought. And that is what I did, I pushed most of my sets to failure(4RM, 5RM). I really had to grind the last rep. After just 1 week and a half after my last deload I got weaker. 

For example: 2 weeks ago I did 100kgx5 deadlift. 1 week later I couldn't get 100 and 95 off the floor, I couldn't do 90x3. This week it was slightly better, but still a lot less than my PR(I could barely get 100 off the floor and only managed to do 90x5). Plus, my hips hurt from sumo DL and squats. I had to switch back to conventional(the strength difference isn't due to that because I failed the lift with sumo too).

I was extremely tired after my last squat PR(I took 2 sets to failure), which was 1 week and a half ago. I don't think a training session has ever made me feel more tired, not even my longest runs. I felt tired for days after. It never happened to me that it would take me so long to recover. I am wondering how much this is going to last. Right now I was trying to do the same routine at a lower RPE, but what I estimated would be an RPE of 7 based on my previous PR, turns out to be more like a 9 or 10."

Neutral,"New to working out  Hi yall, I'm a 19yo(F) former basketball player and recently I've been trying to get back into the sport. However, I haven't played or worked out in around 4 years. 

A few days ago, I played a 1v1 with my friend and just running up the court made my chest immediately constrict and my legs start to cramp. I really want to be able to play again because that was the most relaxed I have ever been since starting college. 

My overall question is if yall have any recommendations for workouts I could do? I'm a pretty weak person, but I would like to get into lifting and something to build my stamina back up. I've also been doing research on my own and many people seem to take supplements when they work out to gain muscle as well. How do I know which supplements to take?"
Neutral,"Functional / fun routine recs  Hi reddit! I hope this is the right place to post.

Background: Early 30s. I strength train 3 times a week and have been for the past couple of years. I'm a pretty average intermediate lifter, currently running Average To Savage. I go to spin class once a week more often than not and also run 3-4 times a week (max 25 miles total).

I'm burnt out on my gym routine and I'm looking for something \*fun\*. I would love recs for a program with a focus on functional movements / plyo / explosiveness. Less barbells, more movement. I never clicked with bodyweight exercises (I haven't tried doing a pushup in years) but my instagram feed makes me want to change that. Other things that look cool in reels and I never tried: resistance bands work (like jumping with a band holding you back), kettlebell work, oly lifting.

Any ideas about a program that includes some of that? Or different programs I could cobble together. I don't really care about goals, just I want something that will make me look forward to going to the gym and that it is safe to learn to do without a personal trainer.

Ty so much (:

Neutral,"How much exercise is too much? ( Bonus: Being gaslighted for enjoying working out?)  Hi y'all. New here, both to this sub and fitness in general. Thanks for being a great community :) Sorry for the long post but hey you're here so enjoy the storytime!

**Background:** 29F 56kg 164cm, recently lost 18kg through lifestyle changes. I track my food cause I'm a huge data nerd and have stopped weighing myself but I've definitely stopped losing weight - happy where I am. I eat \~2000 cals/day with 100g protein.

TLDR: how much training is too much training? Can I do cardio and lifting 5x/week?

**Story:** I've always been relatively active, but I was never a gym person. My hobbies include ultimate frisbee (running), hiking/backpacking, climbing, and exploring new places. I ran a couple half marathons a few years ago. I have a desk job, so I've never been really ACTIVE active, but not like I was allergic to moving around, but I have never exactly looked forward to exercising for the sake of exercising -- or even improving my own fitness. Fitness has always been a necessity to enjoy my hobbies, but not something I enjoyed.

About 8 months ago my partner (rightly) said it wouldn't be safe for me to try windsurfing because I didn't have the upper body strength to reliably pull myself up. He was totally right and it was a real motivator for me to realize that to pursue things I find joyful I need to get my act together. He's been super supportive before-during-after my decision to get ""hench"" as he says \[as a joke\]. (He himself is slim but doesn't workout outside our shared hobbies.)

So I started getting into crossfit and endurance cycling. Cut to today, I go to crossfit classes 4-5x/week, cycle or run about 4-5 hours/week, and do some long distance outdoor activity once a week. My past self would say ""holy moley that's a lot"" but as I've eased myself into it, it doesn't feel like that much. BUT my partner's family can be pretty unhelpful. They say I'm ""addicted to exercise"" and that I'm injuring myself, even if I don't know it and don't feel it. They've tried to gaslight me before by telling me I have an ED because I counted calories to lose weight. His mum in particular says I'm too skinny (I'm not) and that I never eat (I do, often and with gusto lol). I've posted on here before but the long and short of it is I'm very confident I lost weight healthily with a healthy mindset. But this time it sounds like there might be some merit to their concerns?

As far as 'addicted' goes... I think it's a stretch. It's true that I changed my whole routine to accomodate exercising, but I changed a lot about my lifestyle recently. and I LIKE exercising, so why wouldn't I want to fit it into my normal life?

I've also seen friends get stress injuries that have kept them from their hobbies for months at a time, and especially as I'm new to lifting and cycling in particular I get quite a lot of motivation from them, so I'm keen to pursue improving at a safe pace!

**My questions for this community:**

1. Is it excessive or even obsessive to workout for at least 1.5-2 hours a day, 6x/week? Surely loads of people do this. The world is full of professional athletes that train for hours and hours a day. My CF classes have the same people in them every morning. I guess I'm just looking for validation or reassurance... I'm not crazy, right? This is a totally normal level of fitness and exercise for a lot of people?
2. Straight up, how much do YOU workout? This is a fitness subreddit, so I get it's not exactly a representative sample of the population. But among fitness nerds, what is the usual?
3. Am I particularly at risk for injury as I'm new to this level of activity?
4. What can I do to ensure I don't get injured, besides simply rest? My CF coaches are amazing and will actively stop me from doing things if my form is crappy, so I do feel like I'm learning decent form from them (and it's not like I'm lifting ""heavy"" and tbh I'm afraid to lift on my own still). I know especially with running and cycling I might be putting my knees and ankles at risk?
5. What resources have you used to increase your endurance over time? I've done marathon training before so not totally new to the concept of building gradually but I'd love to see what you use to educate yourselves on the matter! Like I said, I'm new to basically everything.

Thanks in advance, cheers y'all!

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for the support and brilliant advice. This community f'n rocks. My biggest takeaways are:

1. My workout regime is only a problem if I, or people I respect, think it's a problem. The fact that I balance my workouts with other hobbies, that I don't obsess over when the next time I workout will be, that I don't get stressed or anxious if I miss a workout, and that I'm happy to skip a workout if I feel my body needs rest -- these are all good signs. I think it will be a major call to reassess my priorities if these things change, but for now, it's just a new hobby that's fun and exciting!
2. MOBILITY!!!! All y'all have said it loud and clear! I gotta do more MOBILITY WORK! Flexibility, mobility, and gentle exercises/rolling to prevent stress injuries are going to be HUGE for me as I am relatively new to lots of these activities!
3. (2a). Maybe chill on the crossfit a wee bit. Or at least keep a real keen eye on making sure I'm not injuring myself or trying to race the workout and compromising on form. But it sounds like the general consensus is it's too high impact to be very effective every day. However I'll talk to our coach about this as he's not shy about telling me/any member what our limits are (or what he perceives them to be) and I do feel he's very honest.
4. There are objective health indicators of overtraining -- besides feeling sore -- that I should be aware of, and that many of you have been very kind to point out and share articles about! These include: needing excessive sleep, increased heart rate (even while not exercising), and lower fitness performance. As I am personally an enormous data nerd, I think the heart rate one will do me well as the numbers don't lie!
5. This sub is fit as heck. Y'all keep crushing it out there doing speed skating, pole fitness, ultrarunning, mountaineering, triathaloning -- what an incredible group!

Neutral,"Frustrated and looking for a training plan  I’m overall really frustrated with my fitness routine and lack of results I’m seeing. (30 y/o, average build for context). I’m the biggest I’ve ever been despite being very active. I’m just frustrated because I make (I think) good decisions and have a good workout routine and I’m not seeing any results.

I want a weight/strength training plan I can stick to. The issue is that I enjoy a lot of sports and don’t know if I have enough time and energy to integrate a ‘proper’ lifting routine around all my other sports.

For context, I currently work out about twice a day, 6 days a week. This is because I have a lot of sports that I enjoy, so I kind of ‘have’ to workout this often in order to fit everything in. An average week includes about  2 runs, 2 swimming sessions, 2 rock climbing sessions, and probably about 3ish hiit/ circuit sessions and maybe one hike. 

I know I probably need to simplify things, but can anyone recommend a training programme for general ‘active’ people like myself? I don’t want to be too exhausted from a training session that I can’t go for a weekend hike.

Neutral,"Blogs/ fitness inspo from people with chronic injuries, challenges  So I was born a tight tendon in one leg which reduces my mobility in that leg. It’s not noticeable to people, and it hasn’t slowed me down much (I work out a lot and I used to run 5ks regularly) but my fitness journey is different from most people’s because of it. 

Basically, I’ll be in physio for life, and my current physiotherapist is so amazing. She has helped me realize that managing my bad leg is like a lifestyle choice. I have to consider it with the shoes that I buy, the way that I work out, the way that I walk… I have to do gait analysis regularly to make sure that I’m not favouring one leg over the other. Anyway, sometimes it bums me out. So much of the fitness content on social media is unrealistic for the average person, and even more so for me. I get jealous of people who can exercise without restrictions or pain, and I know that’s not a helpful mindset to have.

SO… does anyone know of any Insta accounts or fitness bloggers who deal with health/mobility challenges?"
Neutral,"Low heart rate during endurance sports  I just got back from a 75-mile bike ride (road cycling), and I'm a little puzzled by my Garmin results. 

The ride took me roughly 5 hours moving time, and it was fairly flat, ~2000' of elevation gain total. It's a route I've done quite a few times before. What got me today was that my average heart rate for the ride was 107 bpm, and my calorie burn showed up less than a 40 miler a week ago.

I'm not worried about the calories as such, but I'm definitely feeling beat. Things have been really rough, and I'd not been able to ride as much as usual for April. I only just got a fitness watch this Christmas, but most of my longer rides since have averaged ~130 bpm. This ride, 130 bpm was my max, and that happened right away for some reason. Subsequently it was pretty stable, even though I definitely felt more or less exertion in various parts. I've been riding/working out most of my life, and at this juncture am more concerned with ""not losses"" than gains, so I doubt this is a sudden burst in fitness.

Is this something I should be worried about?

What should I take with me other than a water bottle? I plan on wearing running shoes, a pair of bike shorts, and a dry fit type shirt. Do I need anything else? Do I need to stretch beforehand or does the class start with that?

Neutral,"Trying to start a fitness routine, but there's too much information out there and it's overwhelming trying to figure out what I should do.  I'm 16F, 5'6 and 125 lb. I do already kind of have a fitness routine but it's barely anything and I'm not really satisfied with it. I brisk-walk 10k steps a day (most of it is walking to and from school, which is 50 min away from my house), I had started a 20 min bodyweight routine I found online but after a few weeks of doing it I didn't really see any change so I'm skipping it a lot these days. I'm also part of the track and field team at school, and used to practice 4 times a week, but the season just ended two weeks ago, so now I'm thinking of taking up long distance running in preparation for cross country this fall. 

Anyway, I want to really start getting serious about fitness, especially since I'm thinking of applying to military college next year. I started doing some research online but turns out that was a mistake, there's way too much information there and it got me pretty overwhelmed. I've already bookmarked 100+ sites and articles into a variety of folders: Bodyweight Fitness, Strength Training, Calisthenics, HIIT, Cardio, Martial Arts (Krav Maga, Muay Thai, etc.), Ab Workouts, Distance Running, Weightlifting, Plyometrics, Yoga/Zumba/Pilates, Kickboxing, and so on. So as you can see, it's definitely a lot. 

And I know usually the type of fitness you do is based on your specific goals, but for me that's basically everything. I want to to improve my strength AND endurance AND flexibility AND physique AND all those other things, and I just can't seem to figure out the perfect fitness routine in order to start improving towards all of these goals at once. Or if there's somewhere I'm logically supposed to start.

Neutral,"How long to use personal trainer when getting back into lifting?  Hi all! I’m wondering what is the appropriate amount of time to utilize a personal trainer for proper form supervision until I branch out on my own.

I used to lift and due to mental and physical illnesses I stopped for 7-8 months completely, losing all visible muscle mass. 

When I was lifting previously, as I started increasing weight I suffered from right knee pain and overdeveloped left lower back muscle+ pain. I have mild scoliosis and no ACL or MCL in my right knee so quads and my left back tends to overcompensate with heavier compound lifts as my form deteriorates.

Right now I’ve started lifting 5 days a week with a trainer and it’s 600$ a month. He’s been great at supervising my form and I feel like things move so efficiently as he sets up all equipment for me and I do supersets and trisets. I think I get significantly more out of my 70mins or so with the trainer than me alone at the gym for the same duration. 

It’s just very expensive to continue forever. Would 2-3 months be enough time to perfect my forms and develop the appropriate muscles to reduce injury?"

Neutral,"Let's talk about gym culture!  So having lived in a different state for a while for grad school, been back home, and now moved back home, I've been a member at a handful of different gyms. Beyond the infrastructure and facilities itself, I'm always intrigued by the various cultures of gym-goers at a gym, and what are some ways one can try to figure out the culture of a gym before committing to a long term membership.

One obvious example is Planet Fitness doing that whole ""lunk alarm"" thing and discouraging people from making any noise or dropping weights. This actively creates an uninviting environment for people who may be into lifting heaving with free weights, and thus caters to a more casual member-base.

I know that gyms that market themselves as ""body building gyms"" usually means the member base is going to be more serious about lifting. But I guess I don't really understand what features of a gym necessarily would make it a better place for body building or competition, versus just your standard, say LA Fitness that has most of the same equipment.

Another aspect I've noticed is if a gym allows minors to use the facilities without an adult present. I don't mean to talk down to this demographic, since I was once that age as well, but there is something about a large group of high schoolers hanging out in a gym together that always seems to mean plates are going to be left on the bars, it'll take forever for them to finish on equipment, and/or they will be loud. Even if they don't come with anyone, they often run into their buddies there and then stand around talking blocking the equipment. (yes, I'm bitter)

I know there's people who frequently complain about creepers in the gym. I fortunately haven't experienced this as a rampant problem in a particular facility, but I'm curious what kinds of structures, or maybe the lack of any enforcement on the part of staff, make certain places more creep-friendly?

Other things that I think could play a role in the demographic makeup is whether the gym offers amenities like massages, or weird pseudoscience ""cryotherapy"" kinds of things. Or whether the free group classes available are more targeted towards a certain group.

Anyway, I don't really have a conclusion. Just would like to hear your thoughts on some factors that influence the kind fo people who go to (or don't go to) a gym, and the kind of culture that it creates."
Neutral,"Feeling burnt out from running and need advice  This question is for any youngish runners out there. I’ve been running for 5 years. Have completed 7 half marathons, a couple 10ks and 5ks, and 1 marathon. My times aren’t impressive (think my PR for a half is 2:07), and while that may not matter to some, it matters to me. 

I’m extremely competitive (mostly with myself), and for the past year have been doing different workouts throughout the week so that I could run faster. Specifically hit a 4:45 marathon in January (spoiler alert: i finished in 5 hours). 

My workouts in a weeks span look like: 2 OTF classes, 1 speed workout, 2 easy runs, and 1 long run. I usually work out 5-6 times a week. I havent seen any faster times.

At this point I’m feeling burnt out from running and feel like my body is the problem, since I eat pretty well (little to no junk food), and work out almost every day. Specifically, my large breasts are the problem: 36D.

So for any former runners out there who’ve been in the same spot, what sport/work out did you transition to? How did you know running just….wasn’t for you? 

I know I can run without putting so much pressure on myself to get the fastest time out there but, I’m not seeing results. And I’m competitive. My mind has pretty much been made up. Im ready to do something else, and just looking for advice on what to transition to and how to do that.

They have a lot of equipment that I'm looking for, it's 24/hr, not too expensive and it's not too far from my house. The only problem I have is choosing between their personal trainers. I've been wanting to get a trainer but didn't have money at the time. 

There are three contenders that I'm looking at. Two of them are experienced female coaches who have experience with powerlifting. One of them is a Barbell Medicine coach and the other has more experience with the USPA powerlifting federation (I'm doing a meet in the fed in August). They both seem very promising but they are $75-80 more expensive than the last option.

The last contender is a young guy my age. He's been competing in powerlifting since he was 16 but it seems he may be new to coaching. His rates were the cheapest and offered a free 30-45 min training session to understand my goals and experience. It's also getting to be familiar with the gym as well. 

I would like some suggestions to see who I should choose since I've never worked with a trainer before."

Neutral,"Gaining muscle but not improving my plank endurance...  Hey all! I'm a 25 year-old woman and have recently starting exercising more as an effort to help with my chronic pain. I have spine issues which cause me to have a lot of lower back pain and my physical therapist has been primarily recommending core exercises, which I do feel have improved my day-to-day discomfort. Planks are something I do every day now (for the past 2 months), and while I definitely notice an increase in my arm muscles and feel my abs are stronger (hidden by fat lol), I find I still can't really hold a standard plank for more than 1 minute at a time...I try to do 5 minutes of standard planks each day but broken up into 30 sec to 1 min increments.

Am I doing something wrong? Maybe my form is off? Admittedly I mostly stick to standard planks so I wonder if I should start trying other variations too. I do, however, notice improved endurance with the other PT exercises so I think I'm definitely getting a little fitter but not in this one aspect. I'm also limited to very low impact activities due to my spine condition. Tried looking this up but didn't find any conclusive answers, thanks in advance for your input!!"

One eating disorder, recovery, opening a business & pandemic later…I’m so out of shape! 😭 In order to recover I had to completely let go of attempting to control my body size. It worked, I’m much happier now, no problem there. 

However, it seems a lot harder to get a good workout in when I’m not powdered by fear! I don’t have any progress to lose, paid program I’ll waste money on or any worry about burning less calories. The goal is general health and strength. I just can’t seem to push myself like I used to without the goal of being as small and muscular as possible!

I just did 4x5 squats, 4x10 ohp, 3 x 12 hip thrusts & 3 x 12 rows…plenty of rest between each, laid back. That isn’t much compared to my old workouts but I just felt like…meh, I’m done, don’t feel like doing anything else. I wasn’t out of breath but didn’t feel energy or motivation to do more. Idk maybe I’m not easing back in slowly enough..or maybe that’s how normal people work out when they don’t have a specific goal? Maybe I just need to get my stamina back somehow? I used to do so much and push myself so hard this feels very strange!

I've been doing functional fitness/crossfit 4-5x a week for two years (with the occasional time off with injuries \[from soccer, I would like to add\]) and will do some extra lifting either on my days off or after classes. I started swimming last year after a knee injury and I really enjoyed it, so much so, that I did two open water swims (750m and then a 1k), which were great. I still swim now but not very often, maybe twice a month, on my ""rest days"" from lifting and will usually do 1-2k in the pool at a light to moderate pace.

Neutral,"Gaining strength without lifting?  Hi! I’m 27 and on the low end of a normal BMI (5’7”, 125ish lbs) and I was wondering if there was a way to reliably improve my strength/gain a small amount of muscle without jumping fully into a lifting routine? I do have some dumbbells and an adjustable barbell set but every time I have started lifting, I have given it up quickly because I find it so boring. It feels good in the moment but it’s not really motivating or fun to me the way running or cycling x distance seems to be. It’s just that running or cycling aren’t going to help me build strength.

When I’ve tried to solve this “problem” before I’ve fallen into a rabbit hole of analysis paralysis where I just read contradicting posts and articles for hours about how “brooo the only way to recomp and gain muscle is to Lift Heavy” but also yoga and pilates and indoor cycling with resistance can build strength. I feel like my head is going to explode.

I don’t necessarily expect a bodybuilder physique but is it possible for me to build a small amount of muscle and harden up a bit doing something like power yoga or pilates combined with the cardio I already enjoy? (Assuming my diet is on point - I eat 1600-1800 calories a day right now, though I could probably up my protein more haha.)

It could be that my brain just really enjoys cardio and I’ll have to suck it up and accept that I will either have to lift or be “skinnyfat,” but I’d much prefer it if there was a way for me to do something fun that feels personally rewarding while making progress toward the physique I want. Why does it seem like all the “fun” fitness activities are cardio-based?"
Neutral,"cable crossovers not improving?  I'll be the first to admit that my upper body strength was nil, none, zero. My legs always developed more easily and for yrs I was never interested in upper body anyways.

Thats changed now though and Ive been following a routine for a month doing various strength exercises for a whole body workout. One of them is cable crossovers.

Now for every other part of the routine (except the bulgarian split squats) I was able to start at even the minimum of 5lbs, and ive since increased to 10lbs (or equivalent for the other exercises like my legs where I could go heavier). However with the cables, even with no weights it was wildly difficult to complete a set. That was fine, Im here to improve after all.

Except, a month later I tried to do 5lbs and just...couldnt. even now by the time I finish my sets its still somewhat of a struggle, just markedly less so. Is this a normal progression? A result of poor technique? Why can I do 10lb fly dumbbells but not cable crossovers?

Neutral,"[52 F] Weighted Overhead Barbell Squats = Fall, go boom  I'm 52F and just started lifting. I have been attending a group strength class 3x p/ week for the past six weeks. Total beginner.
