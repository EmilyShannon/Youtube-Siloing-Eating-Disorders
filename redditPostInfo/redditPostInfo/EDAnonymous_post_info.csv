Disordered,"Diet VS ED  I'm currently on a weight loss journey. I do actually need to lose some weight as I'm not happy with my body and it'll improve my health (I currently have a slightly overweight BMI). 

The problem is that with my past ED behaviours (starving/purging/over exercise) I can't not look to them as a comfort and quicker way to reach my goal. Because losing weight is something I have to do, dieting and increased exercise is also required. It's really hard to navigate between doing these behaviours in a healthy way and slipping back into my past ED.

Calorie counting is extremely useful to me as a weight loss tool, It also drives my ED behaviours. Since the start of my journey iv started losing weight quickly but abit too quickly to be healthy. This makes me really happy as it's quick progress but it's also starting to bring back the fainting and dizziness which I sometimes guiltily take pleasure in being a sighn of me doing a good job. 

TLDR - It feels impossible to lose weight healthly without slipping back into old habits as its something I have to do and thing about now."
Disordered,"TW fist time in my life I've been called fat  Trigger warning talking of bmi (no numbers) 
Tldr: I consider myself recovered and I've never been as big as I am now, and for the first time in my life I was called fat, now I feel a spiral coming.

I've always been considered ""small"" due to my height and frame, and all my teen years I was deep in the grips of anorexia.
When I was 19/20 I really wanted to recover and for the last 3 or 4 years or so I've hardly engaged in behaviours and have maintained a healthy BMI, this last year I have gained a small amount of extra weight which bumped me to the upper end of healthy BMI. 
Which brings me to to today, I work in a residential facility and as I walked the hallways one of the clients there asked where I was going,  I replied with ""it's lunchtime for me"" and he responded with ""you don't need lunch your fat enough love."" And I just about cried on the spot. I didn't realise the ideal of thinness or moreso the fear of being  perceived as ""fat""  or ""big"" was still so ingrained in me. I can't get it out of my mind. I couldn't eat my lunch due to the overwhelming guilt. How do people come to terms with a new body and let go of all these ideals. I feel so silly having all these thoughts so quickly take over my mind and regress the last 3 years worth or recovery. I'm really struggling right now and any support or words of wisdom are welcome"
Disordered,"possible tw: what led you into your ed?  im sorry if this is not allowed, and is fine if it is taken down. not trying to promote ed, just as a discussion !

i know a big cause for many people is media. 2014 tumblr, current tiktok, celebrities in general.

for me it was definitely just growing up bigger/chubbier, and i never really had problems with it but it was really when it came down to comparisons. 

and this is really for the younger kids on here, especially poc !!!

one of the later times was in middle school i was convinced i was so big, but looking back it was essentially because the people around me and my friends at the time were all thin yt girls 😭😭 looking back i was definitely healthy and in no need of weight loss and gain and after everything im now a good amount of pounds higher trying to get back to at least a healthy point

corny as it is, dont lose yourself trying to reach a number. an ed puts this mentality in your head that lasts forever, to this day im unsure of what my body type is; shopping in men, plus size, and women but also getting clothes too big or too small. comparisons only make it worse, especially comparing with your past self, something im struggling with rn"
Disordered,"I think I’ve gained the most weight in two years during this summer  Might be all in my head, might be not. As I truly do not know what my body looks like. 
A few months ago I visited chicago while there was a female basketball players event. Needless to say I was so triggered I ended up harming myself every day once we came back to the hotel. It feels like I’ve been spiraling since. 
I can still fit in all my clothing and all, it’s just… I looked so bad on my birthday pictures, the dress didn’t do me any favors. 
So it feels like I gained everything I battled so hard to lose. Im not even in recovery, I’m still starving myself. 
I can’t believe this happened, truly it feels like I have no control."
Disordered,"Good until I'm not anymore  tw: slight mention of calorie counting and restriction.

Recently I've been doing really good. I used to struggle with restriction and calorie counting and would frequent the  ""binge - starve "" cycle (unfortunately i cant throw up). But for the past few months I've been eating  3 times a day with little to no regret and I haven'tbeen exercisingmuch either.
Today however I was just sitting down playing minecraft and I just looked at my thighs and legs and all I could think is.""I'm so big.""  And I haven't stopped crying since.im going to be 21 in a few days and i still feel so disgusting and frustrated. My question is : Do those thoughts ever leave? I know it's fully possible to get better and to treat yourself better but do the thoughts leave? 
Also I constantly find my self wanting to go back to how bad things were. I constantly feel guilty about it because my boyfriend has just tried so hard with me but I just don't know if I actually do want to be better.  I'd tell all this to him but I don't want to disappoint him."
Disordered,"after recovering for 3 years, i’ve relapsed mentally but can’t lose weight anymore (tw? no numbers)  sorry if the title doesn’t make sense. when i was 14, i was first struggling with anorexia and lost a significant amount of weight. i was young and at a healthy weight for my age but hated myself and all that. i managed to reach my goal weight and it got pretty bad medically but i was losing consistently and fast

now i’m 17 and hate my body again after gaining weight on antidepressants. i’m not trying to be medically unstable again nor am i trying to reach what i had at 14 at all. i just can’t seem to make any progress at all anymore. i don’t eat lunch, i count calories, i work out, and nothing has changed. 

maybe i lack the discipline, i don’t know: maybe my body hates me back now? has anyone else had this experience? why do i feel like a bad anorexic now wtf"
Disordered,"it all feels pointless. i will never be happy :(  massive tw

I just feel so hopeless right now.

I’ll never like how I look. I will always be miserable. No matter whether I starve myself or stuff my face.

Part of me just wants to throw everything away and starve my youth away.

I’ll spend my 20s and maybe some of my 30s with my dream body and then when I’m too old to keep it up I’ll just die.

if I even last that long."
Disordered,"16 and anorexia is going to kill me very soon. Please read, and please stop while you can. Please.  ( tw numbers) 

This is the most important year of high school , junior year, and i’m going to either die in a little bit or fail at life completely. 

I hit an all time LW recently of >!bmi 11.2!< and i’m barely alive right now to be honest. I’m miserable and sluggish and slow and i can’t think. i can hardly breathe deep or walk without the floor ripping out from under me and i’m so cold i can’t even focus on anything but the mind numbing pain of the cold that’s ripping through the very core of my bones. I feel like my hearts not even in my chest and I can’t focus on school work or clubs and i DEFINITELY can’t do a sport so i’m just completely uninvolved in any kind of extracurricular, job, and i’m failing school at the ripe age of 16. My hair is ripping out of my head and my teeth are visible through my skull. My skin is a mottled gray. I am hideous. 

Of course, to make my life a little more miserable and slightly more unbearable, I have to start having mini seizures probably endured from malnutrition or something akin, coupled with other various stages of what i’d guess to be organ failure, so now I get the joy of being barley able to do anything at all. No driving, no job, no hobbies, no real friends, no family that cares, all i do is starve and starve and exercise day and night. I just walk around my town in endless circles to burn off the little crap I eat. My dog is afraid of me because I look so monstrous, people in public look at me with either pity or disgust. All my friends have dates to homecoming already and beautiful dresses and I am unable to even think of going and making memories. 

It’s not worth it. I should’ve never fallen into this hole. I’m going to die sad and misera and alone at just 16 years old. I just don’t understand why me? I don’t understand what I did to deserve this. I don’t understand why my parents don’t care or love me enough to get me help. I don’t understand why I don’t want it. 

I know this reads dramatic, but if you have the chance please try to at least do harm reduction. Or else you’ll die. Literally die. And not a romantic poetic suicide, a slow drawn out torturous death as you watch in horror and a frantic, beating frenzy as you skip and slip down that deep dark hole knowing this isn’t what you really want, but you can’t stop.

The only thing I have going for me right now is that iM sKiNnY but that doesn’t even matter because i’m so miserable i can’t even enjoy the body i’ve killed my self over and over and over again for. 

It was worthless. a meaningless existence defined by the simple fact of being thin. 

That knowledge is more painful than any other symptom."
Disordered,"My anxiety makes it harder to restrict  Like the moment I feel like someone MIGHT JUST POSSIBLY suspect something I get too scared to restrict and eat normally for at least a week or two. Then since my friend has my mom's Facebook I'm scared my mom might ask my friend about what I'm eating which I doubt she'd ever even do but my mom says I'm ""at that age"" where I have issues with eating even though to my knowledge she doesn't know anything about my ED so obviously she's just talking based on what she thinks. But it's just so much harder to restrict if I'm anxious which I constantly am so I've felt like shit because of that all adding together recently"
Disordered,"i don’t know what’s wrong with me  F15. I don’t think this is an ED more like disorded eating but other subreddits aren’t as popular so my mistake if this is not allowed. Every month, month and a half I start this cycle, obsessively weighing myself (loving when the number goes down), bodychecking, logging into edtwt, counting calories, etc. it lasts for 3-4 days until I know i need to stop because if I continue it will become an addiction. Then it takes a bit to forget calorie numbers, whatever. The next stage is a bit strange… despite eating my TDEE in calories I feel the need to stuff myself even if im now full knowing that soon this cycle will come back and i wont be able to eat this stuff anymore. I just want to be able to eat without thinking about it. How do people do that? Please help. its like a starve, overeat cycle. The best way i can describe the overeating part is like i finish eating and im full but im thinking “hmm what am i going to eat next”"
Disordered,"Anyone having the same glitch?  Wowww reddit needs to chill. Every single time I try to read a post it does the trigger warning page where you confirm you're okay seeing this and gives resources. Like okay, nice. Fair. Except no matter how many times I say yes it pops back up in only a few seconds it makes it impossible to read anything. Is that just like a common problem here? How do I like. Fix it? Lol"
Disordered,"GI issues a year into recovery  Hey y’all. I’ve been trying my hardest at recovery for the past year, been sick with Anorexia for two years prior. Recently I have become employed again, and I’ve been struggling with eating enough throughout the day to fuel me as I work (I work a more physical job than most, in retail). I’ve been back to eating about 1 meal a day with snacks on the days that I’ve been working, as I literally can’t seem to stomach much else. My nausea has been crazy bad recently, and I’ve had a lot of burping, stomach pains, and most grossly, diarrhea. I don’t know what to do anymore. Today during my only 5 hour shift I’ve had to run to the restroom at least 4 times. Im having such bad stomach trouble, I waited too long to eat dinner last night and then when I finally did I was too sick to finish and I started crying uncontrollably. It felt awful. I don’t know how to move forward with this as I’ve never gotten professional help besides going to a doctor for the original diagnosis, but I think I might have to. Any advice please would be welcomed, as I feel like I’m at the end of my rope. I will seek medical advice soon, but if anyone has any pointers on what to say or what kind of doctor to see that would be excellent."
Disordered,"Back to old habits.  Awhile ago I made a post here about when I found my boyfriend's reddit post about me regarding my eating disorder. 


I said I would start recovery. 


And I did..... not. 


I gained 20 lbs since that post. Which is insanity. Im overweight again. 


Straight from anorexia to BED like a light switch. 


Sure its fun getting to eat what I want.. but then I have to work out enough to burn it off. And I hate working out. 


Today, my coworker sent a video of his dog. And his dog is MASSIVE. It's a malamute German shepherd mix. It took everything in me to not ask.  But I fucking did.


 ""How much do you think he weighs?"" 


""110-120"" (aka, a healthy weight for me) 


Aaaaaaandddddddd just like that.. my eating disorder is back at full spin. 


Can't believe I weigh more than that fucking dog. It's shameful. I hate myself. 


I re-download Twitter and tumblr and have been collecting thinspo since. 


Sigh.."
Disordered,"Losing vision but still conscious when you don’t eat enough?  I was wondering if this happens to anyone else.

I’ve fainted from not eating before and it definitely wasn’t that. 

In two separate instances I didn’t eat for a while and I ended up losing my vision completely, sweating profusely, and my ears rang so bad I was practically deaf? I know I was conscious bc I ended up taking off my shirt to try and cool down. 

I know y’all aren’t medical professionals but I figured Id ask here in case anyone else experiences this?"
Disordered,I’m not even enjoying food anymore.  I had a metabolism day (actually two lol) and I didn’t even eat all the food I got because I didn’t feel like eating it. It didn’t even taste that good and I was extra aware of textures and stuff and some of it I did not like. It was too filling and it left me feeling gross. I don’t think I’ll eat junk food again for a while. Next metabolism day I’ll eat something healthier.
Disordered,"i really need someone to talk reason to me TW/ suicide  fuck this will sound like chaotic scrambling's but ill try my best 

 on my birthday i was at an all you can eat everything was lovely no bad thoughts because i feel like i deserved the food on my birthday and my dad said we are really having a binge aren't we out of know where like a blind to my ed prick, i started manically screaming at him saying hateful things and ended up being kicked out said all you can eat, i ran away i ran to the Bristol suspension bridge a spot I've been idolizing about for almost a year, my two sisters present knew about this i told them of the nightmares i had about it, they spotted me and in a effort to not see them and not see what i was thinking i ran to the bridge dropped all my stuff so i could get there faster the screams of their voices still haunt me, in this mindset ive had enough i drowned it out the voices managed to reach bridge security, whilst i was climbing my skin got caught on the wires i didn't feel much but it caused me to hesitate and the guards dragged me down i tried repeatedly tried slamming my head into the concrete i fractured my nose and jaw my sister was the one to put her hand under my head, it stopped me i was later taken home after being deemed not a danger to myself anymore, and decided i cant let this fucking ed take my life and ruin my familys 

&#x200B;

fast forward to now im in semi recovery im making myself put on weight im enjoying the gym and this new profound energy has led me to be a really nice person and college is going well i still get the odd thoughts, but it doesn't control me i still fast and feel ashamed to eat in front of others but baby steps you know

&#x200B;

I don't know what made me do it but i looked at my old pictures of me with visible bones non existent fat, bruises and deathly pale features, im now flooded with anger at myself i feel like ive undone so much, i looked so pretty, i fucking miss it and i hate it i want to fucking keep going in life but its just screaming at me to lock myself in my room and starve and escape life again

just 30 minutes ago >!i slashed my Toung with a trimming Kinfe repeatedly its so fucking painful i feel so stupid, I WANT RECOVERY i was almost in a honeymoon of things going right i dont see exercise in a negative way i see weight gain as a positive im reading full length books doing well in college, being with friends more than once a month, im not abusing mdma anymore but god fucking dammit why does this disorder grab you with its ugly hands so abrupt its ruining me!<

are relapses normal? or am i still unresolved, ive got a therapist finally. Luckily I'm going tomorrow but I've never met them before, and they specialize in gender dysphoria but hey"
Disordered,"I'm mouse?  Idk if these really belong here but I found these two open access articles about how food restriction causes over exercise in rodants and how that relates to humans with eating disorders and it makes so much sense from my experience.

Disordered,"Starting university with an eating disorder  I was wondering what other people's experiences are of starting university with an eating disorder? I was diagnosed with anorexia, 'recovered' (became weight-restored but still had lots of disordered thoughts) and in the past couple of months, I have begun a relapse, nothing too serious; I feel embarrassed to reach out for help because I'm not underweight anymore lol. The problem is that I start uni in less than two weeks, and a biiiig part of me wants to completely relapse and become skinnier than I have ever been before, and my body image is the worst its ever been. Has anyone else been in this position? What kind of resources are there in the UK for university students with eating disorders. Please help! (but at the same time don't help lol cuz I wanna fully relapse so bad :(  I feel like I am so torn between the mindset of ""I may as well fully recover because I'm weight restored and it would take too long to to loose that much weight again anyway"" and ""I want to have lost so much weight so that  by Christmas I am basically just a skeleton"""
Disordered,"Renpho scale is my personal hell  AHHH I know I should stop using it but I simply won’t so I’d just like to complain instead :’(

My parents got a renpho scale like back when I was in high school and at my lowest weight and I LOVED it because it was just so reaffirming of how tiny I was. Now?? Two years later?? It’s my opp, man I hate that thing 

Well, more like I hate how much weight I’ve gained. I was >!102!< in January of 2021 and now I’m >!137!< and seeing the chart it gives you spike so high makes me feel so awful. Being told I’m nearly overweight makes me feel awful. Seeing the difference in the body fat percentage makes me feel so awful.

Won’t stop using it, however."
Disordered,"Does anyone know how much Monte Nido res costs compared to ERC?  Hi y’all.

I’m needing to go to res and I’m between monte nido and ERC both in Chicago. Monte Nido seems nicer and more my jam but they also seem much more expensive since the food is cooked by a chef and there are private rooms and less beds compared to ERC. Does anyone know if the cost (with or without insurance) is comparable between the two organizations?"
Disordered,"I feel like everyone eats less than me (TW: calories)  I find it so hard to eat at school when I see that my friends aren't eating at the same time. I know they probably do eat, maybe they just happen not to eat when I'm around. After all, we're not always together. But I still feel like restricting when I see that I am the only eating at a certain moment. It's awful, restricting more means I'm losing control over food and there's nothing else in my life but food that gives me that satisfaction and most importantly, keeps my mind occupied with thoughts other than those of suicide.

If I lose control, there will be absolutely nothing to keep my distracted."
Disordered,"Trigger warning, so I’m small for my average hight, and it’s because of a stress induced eating disorder; I cannot eat or keep food down when I’m stressed.  I don’t like being told constantly that I need to eat more and that I’m underweight for my hight. I think I’m actually average but my family says I’m smaller… I can only get hungry when my seroquel kicks in. I’m always stressed and this is not helping me become less stressed so I feel safe enough to eat. Also doesn’t help that I’m so depressed and anxious I don’t even really care to eat. I’m not doing this to lose weight, I’m fucking stressed and my body is eating itself ffs."
Disordered,"Resigning from doing a subject because of a cake  In case you don't know how it works in the UK: when you're 16/17, you get to choose 3 to 4 subjects you want to study for the last two years of your education. I've chosen 4, even though it's not recommended.

Well, today was my first day back at school and I have a new literature teacher. Great guy, very passionate about the subject BUT he has this tradition that once a week, we start a lesson with a cake. One person brings a cake and everyone eats a slice for the first FEW minutes of the lesson. 

One: I will have no idea how many calories the slice will have. Two: FEW minutes? I need at least 30 minutes. Three: eating in front of everyone is not for me. And four: I would have to make a cake every term.

So I have decided, I'm dropping English Literature. It's the subject I was the least sure about anyway and I doubt that I will be able to handle 3 A levels, let alone 4 and a cake. Tomorrow morning I'm going to speak to the sixth form team about changing my subject options, right before my first lesson: English literature."
Disordered,Stuck between wanting to look shredded and emaciated at the same time.  Part of me wants to have the typical gym bro body while also being emaciated. Someone tell me how I can have both at the same time.
Disordered,"favorite safe foods?  just curious. mine would include peanut butter, quest protein bars, and fruits. coffee is sometimes fine mostly for its assistance to the many laxatives in me.

edit: this is so heartwarming to me for some reason to read the responses (although I know it has uh .. underlying issues), I feel a little sense of connection. thank you all."
Disordered,"Ruined my streak with just 3 slices of pizza. (minor TW for one number)  After about a week of restriction/intermittent fasting and drinking large amounts of coffee in between every meal in order to suppress my appetite (which led me to be a pound away from hitting my goal weight successfully), I *stupidly* ate some slices of pizza that were offered to me by a family member at dinner thinking it wouldn’t do any damage. 

Checked the scale only for me to see I’m *four* pounds heavier, placing me nearly right back to where I started. I get that it’s water weight and it’ll slowly dissipate throughout the entire day + if I use the bathroom enough times, but GOD was that aggravating and disappointing to see. Ugh."
Disordered,"I hate the physics of weight loss  Oh, you severely restricted 4 weeks in a row? Congrats, you went down a size, maybe. 

You binged for 3 days in a row? Yeah, it’s gunna take 2 weeks minimum at a STRICT calorie deficit for JUST the water weight to start thinking about declining and btw you’re going to bloat so bad your entire body will go up 3 sizes. And your face will swell. And you’ll be hungrier. Bitch."
Disordered,i have so much anxiety about calories  rationally i know that it’s illegal to have false nutrition info on foods but there’s a growing thing in my mind that keeps telling me that the labels are untrustworthy and that all the foods actually have way more cals than they say
Disordered,the conflict between skinny and wanting to build a butt lol:/  wanna hit the gym and finally get a butt but also have a crippling restrictive ed 😍🙈
Disordered,"I’m boiling  When my ED was in full swing I was freezing all the time, this made it really easy to wear sweats and baggy clothes no matter what time of year. I’m about two months into recovery and now I’m just boiling! I don’t think I’ve ever had so much sweat lol. It makes it super hard to go to sleep too, I can’t sleep without a blanket so I take off layers and I’m still too warm. I’m investing in a fan so I have a solution, just didn’t really think about this as a side effect to recovery. Has anyone else experienced this?"
Disordered,"Why is it so easy to starve this time around?  Possible TW

I had a relapse with my eating disorder and I can starve myself for days no problem. It’s been a while since I’ve had a true relapse with my eating disorder but I don’t remember it being this easy. I feel like maybe it’s because I’m suicidal and couldn’t give less of a f about myself?

edit: i should include that i’m safe and have no plan"
Disordered,"I don’t know who I am without an ED  It’s about to be nearly a decade of me having an ED but I never had a healthy relationship with food. I was never taught how to eat properly I never had the right nutrition growing up, I was an obese child and an underweight adult I never had a chance at being healthy. When it’s my turn to have kids if I even can I’m making sure that the little friend will get all the vitamins and support they need. I’m in my mid twenties and still act like the same fifteen year old scared of a honey bun they used to love. This shit is so exhausting to carry for the rest of your life."
Disordered,"can *redacted* be a healthy amount of kcals?  Tw tw tw: numbers! Dont know how to ask this without using numbers. 

Okay so I always hear that you have to get at least 1200 kcals a day to lose weight healthily, but I feel like I maintain/gain at that amount. 

And ive found that on 800 a day I can still eat a lot of veggies/foods i like, I lose like 2 pounds a week which is supposed to be a healthy amount, I feel energized and I dont get dizzy at that calorie amount. Sooo... I mean are we sure 800 is unhealthy for everyone? Could that be a healthy amount for me?"
Disordered,"Anyone else have disordered parents who denied them food as a child?  My parents never made me breakfast. My mom wouldn’t give me snacks for school because I “was fat”. I got two pieces of bread, a ham slice and a pickle for lunch. My dad didn’t buy snacks because he was too lazy to buy them and ate out for every meal. My one friend would give me some of her food bc I was always hungry."
Disordered,"i stopped working out and nothing changed?  I was going to the gym for 1 hour everday but honestly it equalled to 2 (getting ready, driving, stretching) I was so persistent about just doing an hour of cardio, and i was so so afraid of stopping thinking I would gain weight if i stopped, but its actually been the complete opposite. I havent worked out in 2 months or more and im smaller and less hunger cues. I guess its since I lost muscle?? Also i would be much more hungry before, which in a way its better now so i spend less money on food and have used those 2 + hours doing my artwork."

I wish I could be one of those girls that just take a photo and post it on socials without thinking twice about it. Or agonizing for hours after. I have literally been thinking about it since I took it at 6:30 AM this morning. It’s currently 8 PM. I couldn’t even enjoy my day because I was so anxious about the photo. EDs suck."

Disordered,"TW: Binge cycle  In a 2 day binge cycle after 5 days of restriction. I feel sick, I feel ugly, I think I’ve gained 5 pounds and I feel terrible.
I’m so heartbroken, so lonely. My body hurts. On vacation. Haven’t worked out in a week. Broke my sobriety. I’m alone."
Disordered,"(TW) I want to relapse. WTF is wrong with me?  This post is a very honest talk about my illness. No weights and numbers but still. If you're not in a good place, please don't read further. I really don't want you hurt because of something I say.
**********************************

Yeah, this is a throwaway account. If the people in my life knew what I'm feeling it would really hurt them. Some background. I'm a grown woman. I've dealt with a variety of EDs through my life. Last year at this time I was deep in my illness. I blacked out at the store and spent a week in the hospital with a tube in my nose. I wear partials because the acid in my vomit ate away my teeth. I fought and screamed at everyone who cared about me and tried to help. I really believed they hated me and wanted me to have a body type that I would have died to avoid, and I hated them for it. I couldn't see that it was killing me. In January I finally managed to get a handle on my illness. I went into recovery and found myself again. I wish I could say we all lived happily ever after


Fast forward a few months. Things are crashing down. My personal life is a disaster. Someone I thought I could trust hurt me in ways I wouldn't have believed. More and more, I miss my illness. At least I had control over something. I had something to focus on when everything was shitty. I miss the numbness. Fuck, I miss not being able to sleep and being freezing cold. At least when the weight or measurement was what I wanted I could feel like I acomplished something, even if for just a moment.

I know logically that it's bullshit. The control I feel when I'm sick is a lie. It controls me, not the other way around. I know it, but part of me doesn't care, and that part makes more sense than it should right now. Yeah, I'm acting like a spoiled child. I'm pretending that this time it'll be different.

Disordered,"Overdosing on One Food?  The title is wonky, but I'm not able to find a better description atm. 

Has anyone else become fixed on one food when your ED isn't managed and eat way more than is healthy? To a point it becomes harmful or at the least not so healthful? 

I've had a few, but the last one was spinach. I was restricting and exercising excessively, and I had stopped eating sugar and starches. I had also cut out fat. Somehow spinach became a comfort food, and it was sort of my reward to myself for being faithful to my (disordered) diet and exercise. I think I was eating spinach and egg white omelets for breakfast and a huge spinach salad for lunch/dinner. I think I ate it for little ""snacks"" between (yes it was dumb and yes I should have known better)

It ended up either causing or contributing to kidney problems. 

A friend of mine went through a period where the only starch she allowed herself was beets, she did pretty much what I did with spinach, where beets became all she was eating for a stretch. She absolutely panicked when she saw ""blood"" in her urine. 

We both kind of laugh about these things now. I guess I wonder if anyone else has done this? She's the only one irl who has ever related to this habit of mine. 

Other foods I've fixated on have been raw broccoli, beans, and potatoes (only potatoes, nothing else for weeks at a time). 

It's weird because I'm an educated person and I know that overloading on one particular food is not healthy. Yet when it happens, it feels like it's normal and rational."
Disordered,"bf encourages ED behaviors  POSSIBLE TW!!

in a previous post, i talked about how my bf didnt care when i told him about my an-r & that i felt i ""wasnt sick enough"" (i do understand he cant constantly take care of me but it still hurt when he brushed me off.) 

2 nights ago, i was really struggling & he kept asking what was wrong, he said ""please talk to me,"" so i told him everything. it was a long talk that brought some tension between us but everything is fine now

yesterday, (this situation happened in a gc) my friend (who is a very horrible friend ngl) started talking about how she asked this girl ""how did you gain so much weight?"" (WHICH IS NOT OK TO ASK BC THE GIRL HAD A HISTORY W EDS!!) and my friend said the girl got mad then my bf replied ""people shouldn't be so soft."" they agreed w each other then bf jokingly said ""eat her"" & friend said ""no, she's probably too many calories."" i told them that they were being mean & my friend said ""she deserves it, did you even see her weight? girls dont need to weigh that much."" then bf hearted her message like he was agreeing?! i was so appalled😦 like, if i gain weight would he think that about me??

plus, bf is always making jokes about ""oooo look im drinking my calories"" to that friend & stuff about eating in front of mirrors & working out after meals. this was just TWO DAYS after i spilled my heart out about my ED - cant a mf be at least a little bit mindful? 

TLDR; told my bf about my an-r, he didnt gaf & started joking about EDs w my toxic friend & agreeing with mean, triggering things

!!UPDATE!! I brought it up & he didn't really care but he also got sorta mad at me💀 but i think it's fine, i don't think he'll talk like that again now that he's aware it upsets me

This meant eating takeout and taste testing new street food and restaurants in new cities, but every time I would do that a voice inside of me would remind me that this was yet another day I wasn’t logging my food on MFP, spending 2.5 hours in the gym or completing my 10k steps.

Disordered,"My TDEE is complete bullshit in my opinion  TW numbers — My metabolism is so fucked. When I put my stats in a TDEE calculator it says with my light to medium exercise (all I do is walk everyday) - that I can eat 1661 to maintain? So then they am I absolutely maintaining my weight at HALF of those calories? I’m not even exaggerating. I wish I was lying, but I am eating between 600-950 calories a day. Maybe once in a while I’ll have 1,000 but my Ed and my depression has gotten so bad due to the living environment I’m in and trauma resurfacing, there’s no way in hell that my TDEE is 1661. And to take it even further, it tells me what my macros should be if I want to maintain or “cut”. If I are the macros For maintaining I would 100% gain weight. I’m eating less than those Macros consistently and I’m maintaining. The macros it shows for cutting is higher than what I’m eating right now. 🤡🤡🤡. I get so upset and triggered when I hear ppl talk about this on podcasts and then the calculators. So how does this work for me then? I guess I’ll just have to restrict like this forever if I don’t want to gain weight, which I am not okay with. I still look thick even as I’ve lost weight, because I’m so short. I just feel so screwed. It would be nice to just get to 1200 and call it a day and maintain. But I’d probably gain weight on that, and if I am ANY larger than I already am I will have a panic attack. I’m just not okay with getting any larger than I already am. I’m good with the size i am now. But maintenance doesn’t make sense to me."
Disordered,"Feeling like a complete fraud rn  (Sorry for the long post. I really hope this doesn't rub people the wrong way or whatever, I'm having a meltdown and want a bit of support and a place to vent that isn't my diary)

I mainly high restrict from anywhere between >!900-1250!< a day because with studying and working in student accomodation housekeeping three days a week I annoyingly need the energy or else the lethargy would be too strong. I've been experiencing really bad imposter syndrome around my eating habits lately and questioning if I really have a problem or am simply overexaggerating and being the worlds biggest drama queen. So anyway, got told last night that my grandparents were coming over for dinner, I planned my whole day around it, calorie budgetted for it and dreaded the night because I knew it was just going to involve a bunch of internal self loathing about food, comments on my body, pressure to eat more than I want to in order to not look sus, and my grandmother giving me sugary snacks out of kindness while I pretend to be grateful in spite of internally panicking and wanting to throw it all into the nearest trash can. 

Dinner rolls around, I restricted successfully the whole day, didn't go cycling as planned because I needed to start on an assignment or else I'd be behind (while promising myself I'd make it up by going out tomorrow). I get through the cheese platter ok with only a few small nibbles of things and feel ok with eating the spaghetti because I made allowances for myself. But then when I ate it was like a switch had flipped, suddenly I actually felt how actually hungry I was. So I went back for a second serving of spaghetti. Then I ate half a block of chocolate. Now I'm sitting here, feeling bloated and like the world's biggest fattest fake ever and like I had lost control. And the thing is, I know the amount I ate probably went over my TDEE by maybe a 100 or so calories and yet it feels like a binge even though it actually isn't (my best friend went from having AN to BED during his initial recovery and the binges he described to me were infinitely more than the amount I ate today), so then I feel like a piece of shit for classifying this as a binge. 

The thing is this is the second time in a week this has happened where I got possessed to eat more than my usual intake and I have no clue why - usually I have so much better control over myself and it feels really mortifying to me because it's like oh do I really have an ED or am I just on a strict diet. I don't ever purge because I hate the feeling of vomitting and whenever I have a food related social event I can't weasel out of I fast most of the day, then make very slight concessions for myself to eat during the event and then make up for it by restricting like crazy and exercising the next day. All in all, I feel like a fraud *and* a fat pig at the same time. Guess I'll live off strawberries and black coffee tomorrow cuz I'm too afraid to even check the scale number in the morning."
Disordered,"I wish this felt like a win  Last night I went out for date night at a Michelin star restaurant with a fixed menu. Originally there was some confusion about my food allergies and the host said they would only be able to serve me the 3 course menu instead of the 5. Which, of course, was just fine with me. But then the chef went out of his way to make us a full 5 courses that were personalized to my dietary needs....except he didn't communicate the change. So I ate the first 3 feeling confident.....and then they kept coming. It all tasted so good and I felt so guilty that they made it special that I just ate everything because I didn't want to be a brat who let their ED take this incredible experience for granted. Even the fatty fear foods and the two desserts and the lil canapés. 

And it felt like a major win until I came home and changed into my PJs and saw my stomach and woke up hungry and won't let myself have anything but coffee today.....I'm such a rigid, anxious planner and if I'd known we were eating 5 courses then I know I wouldn't feel the need to overcompensate the next day."

Disordered,"Froyo lab monday  Hope y'all are having a nice Monday. I did some shopping with my mom today. Had to help pick up snacks for my younger brothers. I also went to Target to find a nice sports bra and salsa. That sounds kinda funny lol

Anyways, I went to this place called ""yogurt lab"" today. Last time I went there, I was in 10th grade and had come from a choir festival. I was also just looking for a treat after eating leeann chin. Today was the first time in 2 years that I've had froyo. I got birthday cake and coconut. Added some granola on top and a little bit of crushed oreos. It was so friggin good. It felt worth it until I remembered my calorie counter. Damn that thing. It was good either way idc (but i kinda do tho 🙄)

I also had leeann chin, which I haven't had in a while. I kind of enjoyed it but not as much as I did in the past. Its a fear food of mine. Y'know, a lot of my fear foods are fear foods because when I used to eat normally and without guilt, I would eat what i would consider now, ""too much"" of whatever. Like how I used to eat 2-2½ cups of honey bunches some mornings, or how I sometimes used to eat 2 sandwiches a day. It's something that makes me stop in my tracks every time. I just sit there and think ""wow that was a lot of carbs/sugar"" I didn't think of these things too much in the past. If I had eaten pancakes for breakfast, I would balance the rest of my day out with non sugary things. If I had eaten eggs for breakfast and wanted something sweet, I'd eat cereal for breakfast or have a granola bar or two without thinking about it too much.

Its so interesting how I thought counting calories would make eating easier and organized but its just made me anxious and guilty, because after eating something, I just think to myself ""I hope I didn't eat too much sugar or carbs."" My calorie counter is like a record of all my fuckups. I'm starting to think that I'm using it to determine my self worth as a person. That's scary.

I'm trying everyday to break free of the restrictions I've created for myself. Eating white rice, eating grains for all 3 meals, enjoying almond butter.. but at the end of the day, I still have an ED and it's going to take so long to live without guilt and embarrassment surrounding food. I feel like I'm getting so close yet nowhere when it comes to breaking free of my calorie counter.

It's my fault for not just telling my brother that the ice cream was mine or putting my name on them but I figured I could just avoid all that by hiding them away. I go look for them tonight and almost all of them are gone, only 3 popsicles left and 0 ice cream bars. My brother said ""they didn't seem hidden""... even though you would deliberately have to move stacks and bags of frozen chicken (that nobody ever even uses btw) to even see them...???

I’d still eat normally but feel guilty and jealous of my friend who felt the same as me, but actually did restrict. It wasn’t fair, the war in my head was exactly the same, but no one cared or noticed my struggle. This year I had a string of terrible things happen which caused me to restrict because I physically couldn’t eat due to Crippling anxiety & depression. That then turned into anorexia. It’s embarrassing to admit but I was so Impressed & proud of myself that I was finally able to starve myself, something I’d never “had the motivation/ability” to do prior to this. I reached my goal body… something completely unreachable. It was like I’d passed my qualification of having an ED. Didn’t count before then because I was a healthy weight, if not overweight. Now people were worried & I loved it. Eventually my body fought back and I ended up with BED, then bulimia… then BED again. The glamour of being stick thin disappeared down the plug hole with my vomit the first time I ever purged… I looked at the girl in the mirror and was horrified. What was I doing? Weight more than returned… & everyone stopped worrying… And I’m so disappointed with myself. They all think I’m ok now, but really I’m just trapped where I’ve always been, my invisible ED. I think (in my Experience) undetectable ED stages are worse than active/obvious ones because at least when you are too thin people notice & mention it all the time. I can talk about it.. (or as I see it in my twisted mind, congratulate me… worry = praise) I was allowed to suffer loudly. where as when they think I’m fine, weight restored… I hate myself more than ever. It is the darkest, loneliest, feeling. No one cares anymore because you’re “healthy”, no one comments on your body anymore. You don’t want to mention it anymore because it’s embarrassing. It’s over, done. You’re fine, you’re a broken record. It lingers in the silence. Now I just look back at what once was in that fleeting period with envy. I am miserable. But everyone’s so happy for me, everyone assumes now I’m fine. Will I ever be fine? I don’t think so. I think I’ll just live holding out the hope that I somehow manage to restrict again. What traumatic event will come next so I can find happiness within my small frame again? I’m nearly 29, this has been my mind since I was 7. Will I still be worrying about this at 60? Will I be envious of my grandchild’s slender legs? This life is hell.

I've had the urge to purge quite a few times, but I've always reminded myself of the damage I would be doing to my body by purging, and that would help prevent me from actually doing it.

I've been very stressed out lately (who isn't), and I was feeling kind of bloated today, so I didn't eat much. Around 8pm, I was walking the dog and had a sudden urge to eat some churros. There was a really good churro food truck that I've had a few times. They usually only serve their churros in bags of 6, but I usually just ask for two. This time, it was another server who was taking my order, and he didn't speak English, so he gave me a bag. I didn't want to hold up the line, so I just grabbed it. While I was in line, I was smelling the KFC the churro truck was parked in front of, and I ended up craving some fried chicken. On my way home, I was just mindlessly enjoying the churros and realized I ate 4 churros by myself. I thought I couldn't just have churros for dinner and didn't want the KFC to get cold, so I ended up stuffing down the KFC as well.

I felt so uncomfortable, bloated, and guilty. I wanted to purge right then and there. I convinced myself not to and to just work extra hard at the gym. I forced myself to go workout, feeling gross the entire time. I was pretty proud of my workout but just kept feeling nauseous. I went into the shower and was debating in my head for 5 minutes whether to purge or not. I told myself, I'd just purge just a little, just to relieve some of the bloat. As soon as my fingers reached my tongue, I vomited. The relief felt amazing. I told myself, I'd just purge a little more. I ended up doing it 5 or 6 more times. The guilt overcame me, so I stopped.

I don't/ can't weigh myself so I cant really check my progress aside from appearance and how my clothes fit which doesn't feel reliable due to bloat or having a bad BDD day. Today my SO casually mentioned wanting to get into fitness and I mentioned how i know for my health I need to eat more. I felt like it was a good step since I don't talk to anyone about this and only one other person knows the full extent of my issues. I definitely downplayed it because I am not ready to be that vulnerable and probably never will be, but I felt like I needed to give them a heads up that I'm going to eat more?? Like as a warning? I want them to be completely with when it comes to my appearance because it is very important to me but I also regret saying anything incase I made it uncomfortable or incase they start treating me differently. I don't know where I am going with this.

I'm 150 cm and I used to have it regularly when I maintained a weight 39-40 kg (BMI 18.4 according to new BMI calculator) then it stopped after losing just one kg...then I progressively got worse with restriction and maintained at about 35/36 kgs for the last two years getting to 34 kgs sometimes then binging back to 37 for a few weeks and quickly relosing the weight.

Now I've been told that I have to get back to my previous weight of 39 kgs but I can't cope with that. I binged the last two weeks and I already feel massive at 37-38 kgs and I don't think I would be able to accept a bigger body. I feel this is the maximum I can accept. 2 kgs are a lot when you're so short...my thighs have doubled in size

I am terrified I am going to gain weight and I need reassurance :("
Disordered,"People talking about hunger cues has made me realize i plain ignore hunger cues  (NO numbers talk, just behaviors)

I never really got it when people here talked about listening to/recognizing/honoring hunger cues, and long story short i finally realized it's because I'm *always* getting huger cues, and i *never* listen to them, because i never trust them. I guess i was like ""but I'm hungry all the time. Isn't everyone?"" 😐

I think i listened to them when i was a kid/teen. I remember mid morning and mid afternoon snacks, with friends or at home. I've never been a snackish person in comparison to friends and extended family, but i remember being hungry and responding with snacks. 

I guess things have been like this since i first 'recovered', when i feel hunger i look at the clock instead, there has to be a set number of hours between meals before i considered eating again. Like even when i was recovered, i looked at the clock to see if i could have the next meal, or to gauge the size of the snack i was allowed to have if it was too soon for a whole meal, or to see if it was way too soon and i should have water or tea instead. Basically I've refused to trust hunger cues for years but in a way i never noticed? 

Now i relapsed ofc the gap I require between meals is bigger, and I'm as obsessed with counting and recounting the hours between meals as I am about counting calories.

Can anyone relate? How abnormal is it? Can this be something non disordered people do too?"
Disordered,"DAE feel like sticking to a vegetarian/vegan diet tends to amplify that ED voice?  I'm starting to believe that part of indulging in being vegetarian for me is displacing that level of control into ""an ethical decision"". Essentially I still get to rigorously police what I eat and it's easy to justify low-key restricting due to so so many vegetarian options being low cal / high volume. Even more so for the times I've been vegan.

And I think that this at least for me, passively feeds my eating disorder thoughts. It also makes any recovery unstable because I'm always just one or two subtle steps away from exerting control in objectively unhealthy ways.

I don't really want to give up being vegetarian because of ethics and environmental factors. Also, I'll admit that I like that it's very easy to end up with a reasonable or a slightly restricted calorie number for the day even with ""intuitive eating"". Lastly, there are also the health benefits (heart disease and stroke are two major issues that plague both sides of my family).

I'm starting to think that there's a reason being vegan/vegetarian is so common among people with EDs especially people with anorexia. And I don't think it's a coincidence that it's even higher in the older ED population that has treatment resistant anorexia.

I would love to hear other people's experiences, if only to know that I'm not alone or to get permission to not question my being vegetarian, if I am the only one?"
Disordered,"About the comments of a post about a kpop idol  Earlier I came across a post about a kpop idol I will not name (in case her fans see this as hate) in which the OP talked about how worried they were about the idol. The post had two photos; one from her early idol days (4-3 years ago) where she looked to be at a healthy weight and one recent one where she looks emaciated. It was a very sad post showing the damage such immense pressure can do to a person.

Then I saw the comments. Comment after comment about how if you were concerned for her, you were just jealous because she’s ‘so much prettier, skinnier and perfect than you’. Saying how she has the perfect body and look for fashion brands and advertisers and that nobody could look like her because they’re all ‘fat pigs’

That really just made me feel like shit today. I find myself comparing myself to my favorite idols all the time, albeit subconsciously, so the thought that everyone who doesn’t look impossibly underweight is ugly or a ‘pig’ just hits hard. Fuck man."

I’m really scared to gain weight. I am 5’6” and lost 10lbs last month after my tonsillectomy which put me at 113. I gained it all back in a month and am at 120 again. I’m afraid to put on any more weight because I want a flat stomach and I just feel really fucking fat and heavy. But my brain knows I’m not although my eyes don’t. I feel like I have a double chin and am constantly trying to hide it. I’m also extra insecure bc my boyfriend is only 132 and 5’9 and I was literally 132 when we met.

The weirdest part of this is that nut butters literally repulse me and really upset my stomach due to ibs, but when I wake up during this time it’s like I’m not all the way awake, just half awake, and I go to the fridge and eat nut butter, and then wake up and remember it and feel disgusting.

Disordered,"DAE not let themselves wear a regular bathing suit at pool parties as a preteen?  So I don't know if I have anorexia or not, definitely have disordered eating that pops up when my mental health declines though.

Just wondering if anybody else who has an ED used to not let themselves wear a regular two piece when they were preteens.  Like my thoughts were, ""If I don't have a six pack in this two piece that everybody is jealous of and no butt(I thought my butt was super fat back then and wanted a flat one), then I'm not wearing it.""

I would starve myself and do ab exercises the day before a pool party and then when the day arrived, look myself in the mirror to check if I somehow gained abs over night.  Of course I looked basically the same, so I wore a rash guard and my brother's board shorts and spent the entire time feeling like all of the middle school boys with floppy hair who thought they were all that were talking among themselves about me, saying, ""Wow, look at that fatass.  She's so fucking fat, who even invited her?""

Disordered,"It's so fucking hard to make any sort of healthy choices when nobody around you does  Casual lurker on this sub but hopefully this is the right place to post this. Maybe other people on here can relate to this but I feel like my ED is a direct response to what went on during my childhood. I was obese all my childhood, along with my family, and when I became a teenager I started restricting and fasting until I was UW.

Today I'm in college, at a healthy weight for the first time in my life and I've been trying so hard to maintain it. But it's so difficult when my family keeps pushing to me to eat super large amounts of what is mostly junk food. Sometimes I break and give in, because if I do say no they get annoyed with me and it starts an argument. 

It feels like I'm this close to making a choice between either giving in to their pressure to fall back into habits that will in all likelihood render me obese again given enough time, or swing to the other extreme and fall back into my restrictive eating habits out of this mortal fear I have of being obese again. If I just tell them no then I'm treated like an ungrateful asshole, and I don't want to start any fights.

I feel like it's impossible to be healthy around them and I'm honestly starting to think I should bite the bullet and just find some way to afford being able to move out. Living here doesn't feel tenable in the long run and I feel like I'm going to relapse into one of two destructive habits if I keep doing so."

I would soon find out that exercise would make the process faster.

It wasn’t until I developed schizoaffective disorder that it became my only way of coping with my issues, I lost a lot of weight and was in trouble with doctors.

Disordered,"Just along for the ride!  
Hi everyone! I hope you all are doing very well :-) 

I just wanted to make this post for… I don’t actually know ha ha… Support? Reassurance? Someone to tell me to get my shit together?

Long story kind of short, I moved across the country today, haven’t slept in nearly 48 hours, and have managed to consume more food than I ever have in a day before, and it is stressing me right out. I know objectively that I am underweight And that quite frankly, there is no too much food. Guilt is just so strong though – almost unbearable I also feel very physically unwell, and that makes me really wonder if I should continue to listen to it. Part of me is genuinely excited to be giving myself this permission to finally eat whatever it is my mind is asking for, And it feels good in the moment, but afterwords I just got obliterated by my ED brain. 

I ate a big bowl of cereal, a huge fruit salad, like half of a jar of peanut butter in the form of spoonfuls and on TWO huge and delicious white buns as PB and banana sandwiches, a bunch of handfuls of granola and cereal, a big spanking bowl of oatmeal drenched in PB And maple syrup and lots of fruit, nearly half a homemade peach pie, and now I’m planning to eat my usual dinner that has lots of veg, squash, and fruit, but I am also going to have the pint of chocolate fudge Ben and Jerry’s and more pie. Honestly, the food was so freaking good and I enjoyed every bite, it it just feels like so much more than I’m used to and I feel so not like myself. 

I’ve also been absolutely and utterly exhausted all day. Have barely moved, my muscles are just aching, and I fell asleep on the floor for two hours lol!!

My mind is full on beating me up and saying that this wasn’t EH, it was emotional/binge eating because I literally have not slept in 2 days and I’m having a Major life change at the moment. Healthy brain can see that even if this were the case, that’s such good reason to eat. Objectively, I know this isn’t bingeing. I guess maybe I’m just anxious and scared of change and want someone to tell me it’s okay to do what I did aha and I want to hear if anyone has been through similar things with major life changes/stress? 

I feel like if I was a “true” anorexic, stress should have triggered me to not eat. In the past, it would have, but something has switched and I truly am being dragged along by this recovery thing haha..doesn’t fully feel like a choice, but my body says  it is god damn for sure happening lol!

Disordered,"People are more okay with someone having an ED than someone being overweight.  MAJOR TRIGGER WARNING!! 


Just saw a post of a vintage ad on another subreddit. It's advertising some liquid weight loss bullshit and full of body shaming. It literally says ""Stop eating"". Since reddit is a cesspool, a ton of the comments are praising the ad, saying how the body positive movement is glorifying obesity, fat people should stop eating, we need to go back to ""telling it how it is"", etc.

They are so disgusted by my existence that they'd cheer me on for starving myself. Fat shaming has caused my ED. They claim that they shit on fat people because it's not healthy, but they're defending an ad that is literally promoting starvation.

Fuck everyone who hides behind the ""obesity is bad, im just concerned for other people's health"". Just admit that you hate me.

This kind of shit used to make me binge and gain weight because I was trying to avoid the pain/shame. Now I'm afraid of food and can't eat a healthy amount of calories because I just want to disappear and not be seen at all by anyone because I know that so many people share these thoughts about my body. I refuse to go to the gym or even go for a walk since I'll be judged. You can't win with these assholes.

My brain, my thoughts- fucked. It was terrible. Its the worst food day I’ve had in genuine months. I couldn’t stop /thinking/, and at the little garden party my friend hosted after (with friends!! That I knew!! And trusted!!) I hid, with two chips. I wanted to eat it. I really really did. But I gave one to the dog. And the other I just stared at. I kept staring until a friend came over, n called my other friend, A, (who’s also in ED recovery) to come over. 

A sent everyone else away n I started sobbing. It was a fucking chip, one chip, and I couldn’t even pick it up. 

A helped, they helped so so much. We did a bite for a bite but I couldnt even look at the food, and I spent so long, so unnecessarily long chewing. 

But I got through it. 

And another, and a palm sized slice of pizza. Heck, I even had a bit of cake. 

And then I distanced myself, I stayed away from the noise n sat on the floor because “that bench won’t be able to hold you stop kidding yourself it’s gonna snap and everyone’s gonna laugh and laugh” and I even had to make someone hold onto my wallet, because I couldn’t trust myself not to c*t.

It makes me so sad that we live in a society where that body type, which is honestly a very common one, is probably the least documented or highlighted upon. It occurred to me that having a body type that is “in between” is probably what fueled my ED. (That and gender dysphoria haha)

Disordered,"Been in recovery for a while, losing weight naturally and struggling with the feeling.  I've struggled with food for as long as I can remember. First with binging, then b&p, then just bullemia, and then went through a period of anorexia where I meticulously counted every single calorie, worked out 3 hours a day, and lost 1-2 lbs a week for months.

Over the years, I've calmed down a lot. I'm obviously still aware of my calorie intake and will sometimes pass on food because of it, but I genuinely feel that overall my choices are healthy and NOT disordered.

Then I got a super stressful job, and one of my superiors was a raging bitch. I felt scared to be away from my desk and associated eating snacks with looking lazy, so I stopped eating breakfast and lunch in order to put in more hours, which would result in binging, then a handful of purging relapses and sports injuries from over-exerting myself in the gym just so I could try and feel in-control and good about something.

Obviously, I started looking for a new job, and found a great one. I took a month off in between to focus on recovering (and getting to all those chores my husband and I never had time for). I felt like I was in a really good plave. I went to visit my food-focused family and genuinely did not pay attention to calorie intake, except when it came to alcohol. However, when I returned, I'd lost a couple pounds.

Now I've started my new job, and due to my sports injury have not been able to go to the gym. I've been cooking a lot of good, healthy meals and occasionally snacking out of boredom since my new work load is SO manageable, but I keep losing. I'm getting really close to an unhealthy bmi again. If I lose 3 more pounds I will not be ""well,"" so I've been trying to beef up with a couple more meals out, ordering lattes instead of black coffee, and getting desserts, but nothing is consistent enough to stop what feels like a hemmorage.

I'm not sure if I should even worry about it if I feel like my habits are otherwise healthy? Is focusing on it worse for my mental state than letting myself get smaller (and liking the way it looks)? I don't want to set a new dangerous body ideal for myself by dipping below a healthy bmi again, even if it does happen when I have my best relationship with food.

Disordered,"Nice end to a bad day  Yesterday was difficult because we had a training day at work and then a happy hour and they gave us all kinds of meals and snacks.

And then once I do start eating I feel terrified that I’ll go into binge mode, so overall just a crazy day of constantly battling those thoughts. I did end up purging after dinner and felt terrible about that too as I am trying to get away from that and had almost made it two weeks.

However, I stayed out with my coworkers and ended up having a late drunk night, and eventually decided that I deserved a late night snack, so I got myself a burrito from Del Taco and took it home enjoyed the hell out of that shit and I do not even feel bad about it this morning.

Disordered,[TW] If I strive to have this weight does that mean my ED is not valid?  I want to be really skinny. I’m willing to go to extremes but in the past when I was UW af I had health complications. I’m doing this to stay pretty but ALSO healthy. I feel fat now even though it says I’m fine on BMi calculators. That’s why I don’t want my weight to be too much but also be bones as it affected me badly. I checked the calculator and picked my goal to be just a few grams above what would supposedly classify me as UW. Does me not wanting to be UW mean something is wrong? It makes me feel like I don’t have enough criteria to be considered as a person with an ED. Idk

I am purposely increasing my chances of staying as small as I am when I am already at my ending ages of height grow. 

It’s so stupid but honestly realizing I may get taller if I start eating well again, suddenly motivated me more than anything before. It outweighs any of my concerns about eating “normal” amounts. 

I hope this motivation lasted and I manage to pull it through cause I really would feel so much comfortable in my body being taller, and nothing this far has really made me rethink what I am doing with my intake so much till now.

All my doctors try to urge me to recover, by telling me i can still lose weight and not starve myself. 

But can i really??? They want me to eat 1500 cals a day, and I've done the math, best case scenario, with no binges, plateaus, or going over the limit at all, I'd maybe reach my weight goal of 50kg by early 2025.

I can barely stand looking at my body without wanting to kill myself or cry, and they're genuinely asking me to continue living like this for the next 4 years? They have got to be insane.

The only way, would be to accept my body for what it is, fat and ugly, and horribly manly looking (im a trans girl) 

And i honestly dont know if i can do it, so much rests on me being able to recover, but i can't, i can't accept my body, i NEED to be thin, because only then will i be able to live in my body.

Disordered,"I really need to stop weighing myself everyday.  I’m in a terrible place right now. My mood is the lowest it has been for months - I don’t have the motivation to get out of bed most days, how I’m managing to go to work and keep my personal hygiene in check is astonishing to me right now. 

Food wise is also not great, my anxiety about it all is sky high, I was shaking so much trying to eat my soup on my break today that I was almost spilling it onto myself, and I could barley hold the toast I had made myself to dip into it. Honestly all I can think about right now is my weight, my body, and how much I need to go back to restricting lower than I am now.

I told myself I would stop at xx BMI, and then again at xx but now even at xx BMI I am still telling myself I have weight to lose and that I’m not skinny enough. 

I’ve been weighing myself everyday for months now. It’s horrible and I can barely cope with the fluctuations especially as my sodium, carb, and overall calories intake varies quite a bit day to day. Plus the two back to back weekends of over eating really haven’t helped matters. I know logically it’s impossible for me to have gained any fat over these past two weeks as my restriction and over exercising probably cancelled it all out anyway. 

I just hate myself a lot right now, having to almost act as my own meal support every time I have to eat is excruciating. I’m at the point where I genuinely don’t think I could face a plate of food I haven’t controlled in one way or another which terrifies me because I am 90% sure IP is going to be mentioned again to me when I see my GP tomorrow. 

I know that there’s things I can do right now to instantly improve my mental health. The first on the list is to stop weighing myself everyday, stop focusing on the tiny fluctuations, stop body checking in every single reflective surface.

Disordered,"My mind can’t make itself up??  TW: Mention of calories

It is like my mind is constantly fighting against itself… Most days when I wake up I tell myself ”I am going to eat very little today so I can actually get some proper progress”, and then for the first half of the day I eat very little. I am terrified of higher calorie meals (basically anything above >!200!< calories), and therefore avoid quite a lot of foods. But after dinner (I never ever skip dinner for some reason) I look at my number, and I remember all the health effects of not eating enough I have read about before, and I kind of freak out and make myself eat more (usually by snacking) until I am around my bmr. After eating to that point, I get so mad at myself for eating that amount and tell myself I will restrict next day, and that I should stop caring about the health effects because ”if I do care about the effects I will never get skinny enough”

It is a constant cycle of wanting to not eat enough, not eating enough and then eating more just to regret it… I feel so weak and it feels like my disordered eating habits are totally invalid. I have no idea what is going on but it makes me so angry at myself.

Also, some days it is the other way around. I wake up, tell myself that I need to stop this and actually eat enough for once, so I eat a little bit more than I usually do during the day, but then by dinner time I won’t allow myself to eat anything that puts my intake at anything higher than around my bmr, and I regret my earlier decision to eat enough."

Not wanting to be fat isn’t always fat phobic. There has to be an in between. I admit I am too far on the other side but I also don’t believe everything they preach is treatment is balanced either.

Hi guys, I hope this is ok to post, but I know a lot of our members struggle with not being able to poop at all or when they poop its these very painful rabbit sized poops that feel like shards. Personally I am vegan (not sure if its out of good intention or I'm lying to myself and it's a result of my ED haha). Recently I have made the transition back to raw veganism and I just wanted to let y'all know how nice and helpful it has been for me pooping. Not only am I able to eat normal-people sized volume of food for far less calories, so I can feel safer if I have to eat in public etc., but it is so much fiber that I literally have no issues pooping at all most days (If I am still eating enough volume of course, if you fast your body can't make poop from nothing u feel?). Some people I think are helpful to watch if you're new to raw veganism is FullyRawKristina. Be careful as for some it can become even more restrictive as there are even less food groups you can eat and it can send some spiraling, but I really think it is important for us to take care of the less-talked about issues from ED like colon health, and the low calories may make it easier for some to begin introducing higher volume in their diet/public eating. Also - TMI haha but I stand on the toilet and squat when I poop (you can use a squatty-potty too) which has made pooping even when it's small a lot easier as it technically is the correct and more natural way to poop, plus I have a huge fear of hemorrhoids so that's why I started to poop like that.

On wednesday i just got some cereal with vegan milk and a ligtle chocolate Bar.
On friday i got the same Salat again but with salmon. 

Ob saturday than it kinda ""escelated"". So i got some liquid calories but also got a burger and Fries from burger king and later a bread with some sausage and Salat and a little bit of Baguette with chicken and hummus. After thaz also a qhole Package of cookies.

To make those numbers as palatable to me (low) as possible... To 'win' the day, as it were...

It just...feels good. Right. Safe. Comfortable. Bearable. It makes being me, being alive, bearable.

It's why I relapse over and over.

I am not underweight by BMI - never have been, even when I was a lot more sick.

But I know I'm underweight for *my* body.

Everyone in my family is naturally big (I don't use that term in a negative way), I was always naturally big, and curvy, etc.

Right now I sit at 111lbs, I'm 5""2.

So not underweight.

Even at my lowest weight of 107lbs, I still wasn't underweight. (God how much I wanted to get under 100lbs).

That was the weight I was happiest with my body, how it looked.

But I was desperately unhealthy - I know that.

Very low BPM for me, always cold, always thinking about food, not sleeping well (hunger sure keeps you awake huh), and all of that.

Well, I've gained a few lbs since then, but I know I'm still underweight *for me* (much as I don't believe it, I know it's objectively true).

If I run my hands through my hair, hairs fall out. My hair is much thinner than it used to be.

It's not dramatic, but I know it's not normal (for me).

I haven't had my period in a year since I came off the pill, which had artificially stopped it.

I know my hormones aren't quite right because bloods have shown an anomalous result (though GP doesn't care because I'm not, you guessed it, underweight by BMI).

All of this and yet...

I just can't stop.

I'm back pulling the numbers down every week as much as I can. I'm not restricting as low as when I was 107lbs - but I'm not far off that. I know I could get there in a few weeks if I carry on this trajectory.

And I'm heading there, even though another part me is watching down and what I'm doing (weighing myself, weighing food, using MFP, always trying to choose the lowest cal option, sticking to safe foods, eating different food to my family/friends/partner, etc) saying, why the fuck are you doing this?

I'm 30 now. I've been doing this shit for 5 years. I've lost an organ to it (gallbladder).

And yet.

Man.

Gaming the numbers, it feels good.

Being small for my frame (since I'm naturally big), it feels damn fucking good. Esp after all the rampant fatphobia I experienced - mostly from medical professionals, but also from friends and even family.

How do I get myself to stop?

I honestly feel that unless I go into forced/supervised intensive treatment... I won't ever be able to stop myself.

I've had tons of therapy for this, over the years. I was an outpatient at a private ED clinic for over a year. I've talked and talked and talked about food, my trauma, etc.

I've shown people my food diaries. I've promised to eat x fear food x times a week. I've gained up to like 130lbs a couple summers ago - obviously I relapsed and lost it all.

I don't know where I'm going with this post.

Am I alone in just... not being able to stop? And quite frankly, not wanting to stop? Feeling that someone else / something else really needs to stop *me*?"
Disordered,"I swear my life is getting worse by the day  I was dragged into the hospital almost three weeks ago because my family was scared because my heart rate was low and I  was at my lowest weight due to anorexia nervosa. I have been here for three miserable weeks. They feed me three meals and two snacks a day. The first week and a half weren’t that bad but now it’s just terrible. I can’t even look in the mirror anymore and I have no hope. The reason I have no hope is because after I leave here, I am getting sent to residential treatment. So I am just going to keep on gaining weight. I am now getting all these thoughts in my head that are messing me up. For instance, I keep thinking Im going to gain so much weight and never be able to lose it, and if I stop thinking that and tell myself that’s not true, than my mind starts spiraling down even more and I get thoughts like even if I lose this weight I’m gunna have loose skin. This has probably been the worst week of my life. I’m so uncomfortable in my body and idk what to do. Sorry for going on and on, but ngl it felt good to get that off my chest. Any advice???"
Disordered,"My mother's ""concern"" is honestly rage inducing  Because despite her looking at me with sad eyes and saying that I shouldn't lose anymore weight and that she doesn't want me becoming sick I know none of it is real concern. Because she was the one constantly making comments about my weight my whole life and how it was never good enough for her. She was the one who first made me conscious of the way my stomach looked when I was ten by pointing it out in a photo of me taken at a family dinner for my birthday, saying I'll ""lose more weight if I eat less cheesecake"". Nevermind the fact that I was literally ten years old and looked the way a normal ten year old was supposed to, not even being overweight at all, she still said this unprompted. 

She was the one who took my waist measurements for a dress I wanted to buy when I was eighteen, before raising her eyebrows upon seeing a picture of said dress and saying ""Aren't you a little too chubby for this?"". She was the one who constantly goaded me for being overweight, often without anyone asking for her input, completely ignoring the fact that the reason I ended up overweight in the first place was because of the stupid antidepressants that I'd been put on coupled with emotional eating from dealing with an abusive ex and multiple mental health problems. 

She praised me for losing so much weight these past two years, even though it should have been obvious that I've been slowly descending into ED territory since probably January last year. That didn't matter back then, because I had just gotten back into ""normal"" weight territory and still had bit of a chubby face so clearly secret meal skipping, fasting before every social engagement involving food, exercise regiments that I stuck to obsessively and panicked if I missed for any reason, trying to only eat one meal per day and daily morning weigh-ins with a high potential for self loathing because my weight might be slightly higher than the day before due to y'know, drinking water, all of that was doing good for me in her eyes. It's only now that she sees a problem with any of this, because I'm ""too skinny"" now. 

It honestly feels like I can't win here - either I'm too thin or too fat in her eyes. Make up your goddamn mind lady."
Disordered,will i gain from eating *a lot* of chocolate in the last two days? (tw?)  i’ve been very stressed so i’ve eaten a ton of chocolate the last two days and now i’m freaking out more because i’m so scared
Disordered,"tired  when you start off at a normal weight, become severely underweight, then forced into treament twice, then lose it all again, and then gain back all the weight + 19 lbs all in the span of 2 years. i hate myself and this fucking disorder. i hate every part about it. i fucking can’t stand myself. it just doesn’t seem to end, ever. now i just have starve again so i can stand to live. repeat the cycle."
Disordered,"The idea of seasonal food is DUMB  -BECAUSE it personally INCONVENIENCES me! Two foods in specific come to mind. One of them is matzah. As a jew with textural sensitivities, its such a high-tier food that I just wish was something i could (traditionally) eat all year around. (Ik i could but like… ca se fait pas, yknow? Its just not a thing), so im just stuck, waiting for passover. 

And the other is the sweet, delectable, dare i say buttery goodness that is the sugar cookie almond milk latte (with sprinkles) from Starbucks. I get it “kids temp”. Do i care that the climate is literally tropical? No. The texture of the drink is just too good. Fall seasonal food is just the best. 

That is my bid. I want to hear more from you guys. What stupid societal constraints do you guys have to your food?"
Disordered,"What’s the best protein shakes?  My husband is making me supplement with protein shakes because I’m 17 weeks pregnant and relapsing hard in my anorexia. I know he’s right and really want baby to be healthy so I’m determined to actually drink them. 

What are the least repulsive protein shakes you can get? Ideally with at least 20g of protein or tolerable enough that I could drink two."
Disordered,"Left my boyfriend of 3 years, now I’m spiraling.  TW: weight talk

I left my boyfriend because amongst other things, he was very controlling to the point where I was left with no friends at all but him.
My mom came to pick me up in the middle of the night and I’m staying there now.
I had to quit my managing job because it’s quite literally across the street from where my boyfriend and I shared an apartment and he’s staying there.
And I have to find my precious dog a new home because I can’t take him in my situation and my ex refuses to keep him even though it’s a promise he had made to me. 

So essentially I’m friendless, jobless, without my baby and with no place to live. 

I’ve lost about a pound a day since even though I’m already underweight and as fucked up as it sounds, I see that as a positive because right now, this ED is quite literally the only thing I have. 

Sorry for the rant, I’m sad, stressed and don’t know what to do."
Disordered,"My life has gone to shit again (tw/numbers mentioned but nothing specific)  Im so tired and dizzy all the time. I try and eat, but I literally do not have enough food. 
If I wanted to eat even 500 cals a day. I wouldn't have enough food to last me a week.

Like I don't have enough food. 

Im not even losing weight. 
I feel so shitty. My sleep is all over the place.
I'm honestly on the verge of staying in my room all day and not eating at all.
Not exercising even.
Just... laying down.

The only reason this is worrying me is because I usually constantly exercise. And I haven't done. For 3 weeks now.

I've been going down hill for a while now and I really don't know what to do.

i'm not feeling myself at all."
Disordered,"if you perceive people talking about their ED struggles as humble bragging on this sub, that's on you  This is not a recovery centered sub and I honestly hope it will never be.

While I do agree that some people could do a better job at putting TW in posts that contain numbers, they have the right to complain about how their ED affects them and the gross and fucked up thoughts they have as a result (without it being pro ED of course ).

This is one of the only subs left where ED folks can genuinely and openly talk about their struggles without toxic positivity being shoved down their throats.

Not everyone can recover and not everyone wants to. And recovery is not a requirement to live a fulfilling life. You're welcome to leave this sub if it ain't to your liking"
Disordered,"Constant neverending struggle between not wanting male attention and needing it  I literally have nothing else to base my self worth off. I'm not especially smart and my depression is so crippling that it's a miracle I graduated high school because I missed so much and I barely study, and I have bad brain fog probably also from malnutrition. I'm not good at dancing or singing or drawing (used to be but depression yoinked that from me too). I find social interaction unbearable because it's so exhausting and I isolate myself. I spend literally all day playing video games or lying in bed watching videos or sleeping. It feels like men being attracted to me is the only way I can even see myself as a real person even though that makes zero sense. Like at least I'll have some trait that's admirable to wider society

At the same time I fucking hate men. I can't describe how intense and vitriolic it is sometimes. It's almost unbearable. How they see women as walking fleshlights, how women get shit on for existing. I could write pages and pages and pages about it. At this point I would rather go the rest of my life staying a virgin than have sex with a man. Like don't get me wrong, I want to, I get horny for men, I think I'm conventionally attractive enough that it wouldn't be hard for me to get it. But it fucking disgusts me. There's this intense need within me to be repulsive to men. If not for anything else then out of pettiness that they'll have one less woman to perv on. So there's this constant power struggle within me between wanting to appeal to men and not wanting it. It ends up culminating in wanting to be skinny. But it's so exhausting thinking this way CONSTANTLY it makes my heart hurt. My depression makes me apathetic but this frustrates and hurts me so badly I can literally feel it like I've had my heart broken"
Disordered,"an irl is faking an ED  i don’t know what to do, i have a guy friend that likes me and i don’t like him back and he’s recently started bragging about not eating around me and stuff and he knows i’m anorexic i think he’s doing it to impress me or relate to me?? but either way it’s so disgusting and i wish he would stop talking about it and talking about how he never feels skinny enough and doesn’t eat for days. btw he never did any of this until i rejected him, i would never be saying this if he didn’t just start having ed behavior because of me. Anorexia is ruining my life and has been for years he knows this and still thinks it’s some quirky thing he can pretend to have but he doesn’t understand the true struggles it’s more than just wanting to be skinny it ruins ur life."
Disordered,It’s getting bad again  hi i just need a place to get this off my chest bc i have no support irl for this. I’ve had anorexia since middle school and i’m in college now last year i was very well into recovery then something bad happened and i lost my appetite. i don’t want to be anorexic anymore but i hate eating i hate it so much im losing all the weight again looks like i never even tried to recover i don’t eat unless im forced i never feel hungry and TW THIs IS GROSS but i keep shitting myself from not consuming anything but liquids. I don’t even think i look “fat” but i just can’t eat
Disordered,TW / Not in my right mind  I’ve been restricting all day. I managed so well. I binged on pizza yesterday and left the rest on the counter. I deliberately ate it just now to binge and in hopes it gives me food poisoning and makes me puke. Who in their right mind would do this to themselves? No one. I hate this disorder
Disordered,"1200 is NOT plenty and I’m tired of pretending it is. I did the math to prove it.  Exactly what the title says. This post is targeted towards people in the same circumstances as myself. Obv everyone’s height/weight/goals are different.

The “1200 is plenty” mentality is driving so many towards eating disordered behavior and I can’t believe so many people advocate for this diet without medical recommendations or approval from a physician. The “1200 is plenty” movement has given my brain an unrealistic expectation for what weight loss is supposed to be and an unrealistic goal to achieve.

Here’s the math I did:

I’m 5’3” and 125lbs. My BMR is 1256 calories a day and my TDEE with light exercise is 1727 calories per day. Science says that if I eat at a 500 calorie deficit per day, I’ll lose a pound per week. That’s 1227 calories a day (which is slightly more than 1200 btw if you’re keeping track of the math).

Except last night, I started thinking about the numbers. Why do I need to lose a pound per week? I weigh 125lbs and a pound per week is 0.8% of my body weight. I am asking my body to lose almost 1/100ths of myself every week when I’m not even overweight. I do want to lose body fat and tone up, but it’s not like I’m doing it for health reasons at this point. 

In comparison, if I weighed 250lbs (TDEE of 2507 cals/day) then losing a pound per week would be 0.4% of my body weight, half of what I would be asking for at 125lbs.

So why does our society push this 1200 calories/day diet to us? Why am I asking my normal weight body to work twice as hard to lose this weight as someone who is obese for my height? If I scaled back my efforts to match the 0.4%, then that’s half a pound of weight loss per week, NOT a full pound. 

The numbers are worse when you consider how much of a calorie reduction it is per day. At 250lbs, a 500 calorie reduction means eating 80.1% of your normal calories per day. At 125lbs, a 500 calorie reduction means eating 71% of your normal calories per day.

I’m not sure when/where our society decided that 1200/day was the goal, but it’s not sustainable and we are restricting 10% MORE calories than individuals twice our weight when there isn’t even a medical reason to do so.

TL;DR: 1200 calories a day is a bullshit concept and if you’re at a height/weight where losing a pound/week means eating at 1200 cals/day, then you probably shouldn’t be trying to lose a pound/week because it is asking your body to work twice as hard. We work 2x as hard and put in all that effort and then wonder why we stress and burn out and end up eating disordered."
Disordered,"I miss being delusional  In the throes of my eating disorder, I was so delusional that I thought everything I was doing was normal, that everyone was doing it, and everyone was trying to stop me was actually trying to sabotage me. It became so easy to romanticize my disorder because I convinced myself that it was the only thing I was good for. I didn’t enjoy going through months of forced recovery, but it broke my state of delusion and made me realize that being in constant, excruciating physical pain from starvation isn’t normal. I saw how my family lived and the freedom that came with being nondisordered. Now that I’m actually aware that what I’m doing is bad, and that better exists out there as long as I choose if, I’m 10x more miserable 

Now that there’s a sudden dissenting voice, t feels like my disorder takes up twice the mental space now. It’s all so loud. When I was completely delusional, choosing to hurt myself felt like the most natural thing in the world. Now there’s a constant guilt of knowing what I’m doing is wrong and that I’ll never be truly happy until I stop being disordered. Having two competing frames of reference (ie. ED brain vs non-ED brain) is killing me. I know that being delusional and paranoid is a bad thing, but it made everything so simple, and I miss simple sometimes"
Disordered,"How did your ED begin?  TW: BMI mentioned

Mine started in 2013 at the age of 17 when I became friends with a guy I had a crush on. He told me I was too skinny and that I should gain some weight. And that’s what I did. I truly believed that I was too skinny. My BMI went from 18 to 20. Then he disappeared from my life and I felt like I gained weight for nothing. I was extremely upset and unhappy with myself and wanted to lose all the weight I gained and more as fast as possible. And that’s what I did. Ever since I have had problems with eating. After that I have had periods of time of not counting my calories and being just ”a picky eater”. The last few years have been rough. I have counted every single thing I have eaten for years now and I can’t stop it."
Disordered,"want to scratch my face off  I took stimulants today. My ED had gotten that bad. I told myself I would never take stimulants and that I would limit myself to coffee and diet drinks, but I fucking took stimulants.

I’m so itchy, I just want to scratch my face off. I was fully tweaking all morning. I hate to say it but they worked. I’m probably gonna do this again even if someone tells me that it’s the shittiest idea ever.

Holy SHIT I just want it to go awayyyyyy aghhh why is everything so ITCHYYYYY"
Disordered,"I’m just so done...  I’m getting sent to residential treatment for my diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. However there are a few problems.

1. I don’t want to go
2. I don’t want to “recover” whatever that word means
3. My whole family is convinced that “this is going to be the turning point for me” and    “ I’ve never had intensive therapy” but I have had therapy and I already know what the therapist are going to say there, “Oh, love your body the way it is, “Practice mindfulness and be at peace with who you are”.... like no
4. I’m a teen boy, and the place I’m going is all girls, so that in it of itself is just gunna be weird.
5. I’ve been in the hospital for two and a half weeks and they forced me to eat so I’ve gained weight and feel terrible right now, so the last thing I wanna do is recover.
6. I have no motivation to get better and I feel best when I’m skinny and restricting.

Basically, I don’t wanna recover and I think it’s just stupid that anyone should be forced to go somewhere that they don’t feel mentally prepared for or feel like it could help them... and it’s not just me either, so many people have said that they were not ready or did not feel safe or comfortable being in a locked environment.

Sorry for venting😭😭😭. I just had to get that off my chest."
Disordered,"I seen my parents for the first time in like 6 months and they got so skinny from health issues  I seen my parents in person for the first time in like 6 months. I don't see them often because they don't live very close by and I don't have a car right now. They both have developed health issues over the last couple years that effects their ability to eat. Their health is deteriorating pretty fast.

My mom was always on the bigger side, but she lost so much weight. You can see the extra skin on her arms. My dad was always thinner, but had some muscle, especially on his arms. When I seen him yesterday, they looked like twigs and also had extra skin.

This really fucked me up. Watching them fall apart and get older is breaking my heart and I hate it because they're not even that old.

I feel even worse now about my weight and feel like if they can't eat and be healthy then I don't deserve to either. I feel like I should suffer with them."
Disordered,you know you're disordered when...  your SO will be out of town for a few nights and you have to decide between whether you want to fast the whole time or have a major b/p session
Disordered,DAE  Probably dumb to ask. But does anyone else legit wish something bad happened to them so you’d like die and get over your eating disorder? Regardless of what it is. Struggled with Ana first now i restrict like once or twice and binge the rest. Binges suck because of all the stomach aches and all the guilt. They all fucking suck.
Disordered,"where would I post an ed related comic?  I’d like to make a comic about eating disorders, and am wondering which website I would even post it on if I were to make it. I’m really not trying to promote myself, just wondering, since ed content can get flagged by tumblr, art gets buried on Twitter and Instagram, and reddit just doesn’t seem like the place to post a series. neocities? i don’t want to put it somewhere like webtoon because children use that app + I want it to be for people w/ eds first before just anyone because I feel like a lot of the ed media I’ve seen is more for (for lack of a better word) normal people and the good ed media tends to be hard to find/obscure and not popular"

Normally she takes my weight and checks my vitals before meeting with my parents so i plan on telling her when it’s just us two. But sometimes it’s not my doctor it’s an intern who does my vitals and stuff :(

My guardians are always busy because they have their own kids and work. They are always tired when they come home and I don’t want to add onto their own problems.

She said that I was being a psychopath. I just couldn’t get the words out of my mouth. I wanted to tell her what’s going on but she just got mad at me and told me that my family doesn’t need any more problems. And that people see what’s going on so I need to act better or they’ll kick me out.
