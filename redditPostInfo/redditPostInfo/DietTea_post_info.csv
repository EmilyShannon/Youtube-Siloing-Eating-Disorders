Disordered,Posted unironically…  
Disordered,"Anyone have ED parents?  **BIG TW for ED behavior and numbers of all kinds. I don't how to blur out weight numbers/put the spoiler tag on individual words, so just know it's in the post**

I know this subreddit is for toxic diet culture in diet communities, but did anyone else first encounter toxic diet culture in their own home?

My mom (and grandma too) kickstarted a lot of disordered eating in me by commenting on my body ever since I was a small child. I was always just a little overweight, but my mom and grandma would talk about my body like it was something to be fixed and thus I have wanted to diet since at least 8 years old. 

Mom and grandma also feel the need to comment on how little they're eating every time. Like ""oh, I could NEVER eat a full portion of that,"" or ""I'm SoOoO full"" (after eating a comically small portion). And then following crash diets and giving me random diet advice constantly. Mom would also bodyshame dad by calling his stomach ""Entity"" (like, as in saying that his stomach is so big that it's it's own conscious ""entity,"") and when I was a kid I thought that was really funny, but now I'm realizing that it was fucked up that mom would joke about my dad's body so much.

I feel like a lot of body dysmorphia comes from my family. One time I lost a lot of weight bc of undiagnosed bipolar mania and became quite skinny. My granddad told me, ""Wow, forgottenellipses, we're all so proud of your progress. You look good now. We were so embarrassed to be seen with you before. It was disgusting You were such a whale."" Then, he blew his cheeks full of air and said, ""Your face looked like this before."" All of my family was around, including grandma and mom, and no one defended me or said that what my grandad said wasn't true. No one should EVER be embarrased to be seen with someone bc of their weight. And also, I wasn't even that overweight--my highest weight so far at that time was 160 lbs at 5 foot 5...which is a very common weight in the area where I'm from. 

Obviously, I go back up to 160 and even overshoot that weight a little bit when I got treated for bipolar disorder because the medications for bipolar cause weight gain. Suddenly, my mom and grandma accuse me of ""letting myself go,"" and I wonder if they feel embarrassed of me like my granddad said.

I feel angry at my mom for the many times she's reinforced disordered eating/bodyshaming in my family, but mostly I'm scared because I know she has a full blown eating disorder. She constantly combines multiple super restrictive diets at a time and never eats with the family when we consume a meal that she didn't prepare. Her meals are distressingly low calorie: a ""smoothie"" that's just unsweetened almond milk and collagen powder, a tiny piece of grilled chicken and broccoli, a granola bar, bone broth, and steamed vegetables. I once told her that she needs to eat at least 1200 calories a day (I know that people almost always need more than that to survive) and she told me that she didn't need 1200 calories and that eating only steamed vegetables and bone broth all day was okay because she ""wasn't hungry."" I wonder how she's able to maintain a normal weight with this restrictive diet and even how she's alive, but I've seen evidence of binges (empty donut boxes and stuff like that). Every time she gets restrictive, she starts having a hard time coping with strong emotions and takes it out on me and the rest of the family. She sleeps a lot and spends a full-time job's amount of time reading the Bible or Christian books and going to Bible studies. I'm just scared she's not enjoying life very much and just wished that she would nourish herself even if it made her gain weight.

Anyway, this post was a trainwreck, but does anyone have similar stories or any advice on how to talk to my mom?"

Disordered,"You can't be over 5' tall, mobile, actually need to lose weight and have a TDEE of 1200  TW: (lots of) numbers

After seeing so many short, sedentary woman posts on other subs and how we basically shouldn't eat at all, I did some calculations, just out of curiosity.

Let's try a legit tiny, sedentary woman first. For a 35 year old, 5ft0 woman, the minimum weight to be classed as overweight is >!129lbs!<. If we assume the minimum activity level possible -described  [here](https://www.sailrabbit.com/bmr/) as 'Immobile, Stationary with Some Arm Movement, Bedridden or Partially Paralyzed', their TDEE would be >!1370!<, so at 1200 they would be losing >!a little less than 0.5lbs!< per week. For this woman to have a TDEE of 1200, she'd have to weigh >!89lbs!< and have a BMI of >!17!<.

For a more common scenario that we see around Reddit, a 35 year old, 5ft4 woman with an office job, the minimum overweight weight is >!146lbs!< and their TDEE would be >!1694!<, at 1200 they would lose >!about 1lb!< per week. For this woman to have a TDEE of 1200, she'd have to weigh >!47lbs!< and have a BMI of >!8!<.

Basically, if you need to lose weight, your maintenance is not 1200.

I've plotted these data [here](https://imgur.com/a/DGtHiSq), just because I like graphs and data.

Edit: I just wanted to add that these estimates are the absolute bare minimum, not the average, most people, including sedentary people, will need to eat much more. Please don't use this info as advice of any kind."

Disordered,"Maybe, just maybe, there’s a reason for that  "
Disordered,"I have a bitter resentment to the idea that I am a glutton because of my weight.  I need to vent, and this may or may not be the right place for it.

My body has always been slightly larger than it ought to have been. As a child, adolescent, and teenager, I have always been chubby. As an adult, I became very overweight and then lost weight. As part of that weight loss process, I developed an eating disorder.

At my very lowest weight, I was in the middle of a ""healthy"" BMI. But I was hungry, and eventually, my body got sick of my nonsense, and my weight rebounded to the ""slightly overweight"" category, where it has largely remained.

I have gone through periods of weight loss, and the weight loss is temporary because the hunger eventually becomes so terrible that I have to choose between eating and sleeping. My diet is not poor; it includes a variety of vegetables and lean proteins and complex carbohydrates and all the stuff you're ""supposed"" to eat.

But I'm hungry a lot. I exercise and lift weights, and I'm hungry because of it. Eating until I am comfortably full leaves me in a slightly larger body. When my weight has dropped below this point, my hunger persistently gnaws at my belly, to the point where I awaken in the middle of the night hungry and cannot fall asleep without eating. My energy drops, and I feel nauseous from hunger.

There are certain individuals (especially on a certain subreddit) who treat my BMI as a moral failure (and I will at times view it similarly). They describe my eating habits as gluttonous, that I have binge eating disorder, that I am stretching out my stomach by gorging myself each day.

It's frustrating and I feel self-conscious because of it. If only I ate less! If only I understood proper portions! If only I drank water! If only I abstained from mocha frappes and cookies and deep fried Twinkies and eating out four times per week! Of course, I understand proper portions and drink water and don't eat junk food except on holidays or special occasions like my birthday.

Yet here I am, still in a slightly overweight BMI category. Because I have a great hunger."

I keep thinking of the posts or comments I’ve seen where people are happy to not be eating and excited for the weight loss.

Six or seven months ago I decided to unfollow them because I saw what kind of disordered eating they were promoting.

Well, last night I thought “hmm what are they up to”, so I looked them up… and you can guess it… all three of them gained a shit ton of weight in a very short amount of time and/or are weight cycling like crazy. Two of them are complaining that they are dealing with binge eating and are (over) restricting in response to that. One even has major health issues as response to dieting/IF. I also noticed they are all so focused on food and how thin = good. 

Im so happy that I got help for my ED, but I am also happy that I see now what kind of bullshit and terrible borderline ED behavior the diet industry sells. I have so much free time now to just do what I want to do and not think the whole day whether I had “enough protein” or “enough steps”..."

Disordered,"Raised on Diet Culture-  I've just realised that I've, like many others, been raised on diet culture. I had just thought randomly pop into my head about the Special K diet-  not sure if it was a big thing in the US but it was in the UK, where you would have two bowls of cereal for breakfast and lunch and then you would have a small meal in the evening and you were meant to lose weight from it. I remember seeing this constantly when I was younger and I wanted to go and try it when I was older, as I know that my mum wouldn't allow me to do it thankfully.  But that 'diet' was such as big part of my time in primary school and I'd hear about it all the time. 

I'm just shocked how much I've been impacted/influenced by diet culture even at a young age, especially as there is the assumption that it is online- well I did anyway but it's always been a part of my life.  I remember reading about Cambridge Diets, Adkins, seeing Slimfast on the shelves and Weight Watchers products and hearing about people going to Slimming World at my old job a lot and talking about food being 'Sins.'  I can count the times I've had a full sugar drink as I've always gone for the diet/sugar-free to avoid the calories and I've done that since I was eight and feeling guilty if I wanted to have chocolate and had what foods were 'good' and 'bad ' for me drilled into me at a young age.  I was doing things like not eating after 7 pm to lose weight. I was obsessed with my fitness pal and going to the gym right before lockdown.

&#x200B;

 I've been 'dieting,' on and off since I was a child and I'm just surprised as my mum was never a diet person and I just wonder how much I've been influenced by diet culture indirectly. I was chubby at school and I had all the nicknames related to that. I know a lot of my disordered eating came from school and how I was picked on less the more weight I lost, but I know a lot of it was influenced by the diet culture of the 2000s   more than I have realised. I would literally be wishing to be skinny thinking that I would get friends and be loved because of it.  I was obsessed with watching programs like Supersize vs Superskinny and I'm surprised that the program was even allowed to air now especially as  I would want to and try to mimic the diet of the super skinny to lose weight and I would look in horror at the food tubes to put myself off eating.   I'm just thankful that  I wasn't a part of Reddit at the peak of my problems with food as I think that the weight-loss subreddits would have sent me down a spiral, especially with how disordered they are at times. 

 I just feel sad for the people who post on them and are very disordered as I wonder how much they were impacted by diet culture at a young age and how it has influenced them to do things like extreme fasts /eat very little/ observe what others are eating for 'tips.'  I know a lot of it is the morality of being thin and being 'fat,' is bad as well.    I'm happy for finding this sub and finding people who feel similarly about diet culture as I do and it's helped me a lot."

Disordered,"Europe is a skinty utopia  Obviously, the best criteria to judge how great a geographical area is, is the lack of fats. In Eurotopia, there are no fats.  

Nothing else, is as important, and vital, as is the lack of horrible fatties ruining your iPhone pictures of a classical city skyline. 

You can walk from your small, European, non-fat accommodating apartment, across a beautiful city street, with no pollution from cars driven by capitalist fats, to a 600 year old bakery. 

No fatties to be seen! Even in their classical gathering place! A bakery! 

A beautiful skinny European woman struggles to smile at you, and you smile back! You’re surrounded by fellow skinnies! 

There are no fats, or disabled people, or minorities in Eurotopia. We cured these societal ills with smaller portions and riding a bike every day. 

Everyone in Europe eats picturesque, gourmet, deliciously indulgent food worthy for an Instagram page every single day, IN SMALL PORTIONS YOU FAT AMERICANS! 

Europeans don’t ever eat low quality junk foods. Frozen or canned food doesn’t exist in Europe. Dr.Oetkers is Russian propaganda meant to smear the image of Europe internationally. 

Everyone in Europe is a pale, skinty goddess riding on a bike wearing something presentable and not from Walmart like a white t-shirt and black jeans. If you want to really look like a local, bring your striped Breton shirt and a beret.

All of the men are the hottest twinks, and there are no fat men, or women. 

Anorexia is an imaginary illness babes. If you see someone with their ribs and collarbones sticking out, and their hair is brittle, that is the peak of health you fat Americans. 

Anorexia is an imaginary illness created by fat Americans to normalize being a fatty fat fat. 

A sub 18 bmi is peak performance, and every woman in Europe is at least 175 cm tall and weighs 55 kg at most. You are just used to seeing fatties if you think that’s too thin babe. 

Anyone over that weight is taken into the forest and sacrificed to the skinty gods where their remains can be used to fertilize the soil that the skinnies grow their gourmet, cultured food from. 

Every man in Europe, is a sexy stick who could hide behind an upright cigarette and make the cigarette look like it needs to lose some weight. 

The tourists I meet, who are on the larger side, are holograms, American propaganda to make me think less of Europe and to sow anti-Western sentiment into my little brown island girl heart. 

I know, if I moved to Europe, I too, could be a skinny pale goddess. 

It is an extreme idea in most of the world to think that fats, deserve to not hide in a hole wanting to die. 

How dare, fatty fat fats, be comfortable leaving their house, and have the audacity to attend concerts. 

Europe is a utopia babes."

Disordered,So helpful and definitely not judgemental at all- TW calorie counts  
Disordered,"Totally sustainable and healthy, don't worry about a thing / s 🤠  "
Disordered,"What do you want to tell people on the weight subs?  I do want to start out by saying obesity is a big problem in my country (USA) and I do think we should do something about it, and getting a weight problem under control often requires being honest with oneself and making changes that make you feel a little uncomfortable. That being said, I think the best way to combat the obesity crisis is by learning healthy habits that will stick with you through life. Some people lose weight by treating it as an obsession, which in my opinion is just transferring unhealthy habits. I see some troubling things in my beloved diet and weight loss subs that I don't think is really helping to tackle the problem.

1) 1200 kcal is a minimum, not a maximum. Most people need to eat more than 1200.

2) You can't change your height, and you can't change your sex (before you come at me with the pitchforks - you all know what I mean) but you can change your activity level. Sedentary is not healthy. It's better to eat more and get some exercise.

3) It's not a competition to be the skinniest - whether that's the skinniest version of yourself OR skinnier than others.

4) While we're at it, it's also not a competition to eat the lowest amount of calories.

5) You can lose weight by making small changes. Get vegetables instead of fries. Eat half what you normally do. Get healthy snacks between meals such as fruit, string cheese, whole grain crackers, or nuts. Get frozen yogurt instead of ice cream to have at night. Do a yoga video. Take a walk. When you the little things you do become habit, add more habits. It doesn't have to be all or nothing.

6) When you see a post online that says, ""Don't feel guilty for eating pizza,"" that does not mean that they're encouraging anybody to eat 5 slices of pizza every day. 

7) Sometimes you're not going to be able to know all of the calories in a meal (e.g. going to eat at a friend's house.) That's okay. Do your best. Not everything you eat needs to be reduced to a number. Eating is a social thing and should be enjoyed.

8) The BMI range is a bell curve. For example, the healthiest weight for my height is 110-140 lbs. Some people will be healthiest at 110, some people will be healthiest at 140, but most people would be healthiest at the 120-130 range. Don't go for the lowest possible healthy BMI just because it's the lowest: it might not be healthy FOR YOU, just like the highest might not be healthy for you. 

9) Rice, pasta, olive oil, cheese, peanut butter, etc will not make you fat. People have been eating these foods for a long time without getting fat. It's the portions that make you fat. If you're not satisfied with a big plate of zucchini noodles, it's fine to have a small portion of pasta instead.

10) Learn the healthy habits we all learned in school, like making half your plate vegetables, eating all the colors, opting for whole-grain options, etc. 

11) There's more to food than calories. A 200 calorie chocolate bar might be the same calories as a 200 calorie snack of nuts and an apple, but one will give you protein, fiber and healthy fat.

12) Yes, CICO is the magic formula for weight loss. That doesn't mean you need to be married to the number on your app every single day. Use it as a guideline to learn how to eat better. It's not the end of the world if you go 100-200 kcal over.

13) If you want to have a big meal, the rest of the day should be light eating, not no eating.

14) If you work out a few times a week, you're not sedentary. If you do a lot of walking, you're not sedentary. 

15) You don't need to weigh everything that goes in your mouth. \[You can estimate serving sizes\]([https://www.healthyeating.org/docs/default-source/4.0-blog/4-0-16-blog-post\_portion-sizes-serving-chart.pdf?sfvrsn=5633ce4f\_2](https://www.healthyeating.org/docs/default-source/4.0-blog/4-0-16-blog-post_portion-sizes-serving-chart.pdf?sfvrsn=5633ce4f_2))

16) If you eat a lot one day, forgive yourself and move on. 

17) Weight loss is not a tightrope."

Disordered,"So I was on my way to post to loseit but then I found this sub and after browsing...  I think I'm on my way to an eating disorder? I realize this might sound like a shit post but hear me out, because I want some advice (please). Uh.. so I've been paying for a personal trainer because in my head I'm a ripped woman like my video game heros like Vi or Zarya. However that trainer was a lot of money and kind of over promised? And also tried to make me be their personal assistant? It was weird, I basically decided not to continue with their services and I'm just trying to do it on my own. Also side note, rloseit said I should ditch them, for the reasons I said above.   

The last thing my trainer told me to do was IF 16/8, which means I don't eat until about noon, but I am supposed to drink 1 shot of apple cider vinegar mixed with water in the morning. It's nasty so I don't do this, it tastes like pure sadness. I feel my soul leaving my body with each sip honestly. Also 1 time I tried it as an actual shot and I thought I was going to die.

>!So today my coworker brought in some cookies dimensions about 1.5in by 1in and approximately 5mm thick and to avoid some awkward situation and or hurting their feelings, I took one, bit it and chewed/swallowed about half of the cookie. 6 months ago I'd call this a nibble, back then I would have thrown the whole thing in my mouth. Anyway I praised the cookie appropriately, and then she kind of hovered so I threw the rest in my mouth and praised it some more. When she left I still had the cookie in my mouth and for the first time in my life I considered spitting it out. What the fuck. I didn't want to mess up my 16/8 IF so I seriously considered disposing of a partially chewed cookie. I realized how messed up that was and just swallowed like normally would. I was kind of worried so I was going to head over to rloseit to ask if eating less than 5g of shortbread would fuck up my IF.!<

Sigh. 

   I don't know if this post is appropriate for this sub, I just got here and I'm trying to take it all in so I'm sorry if this isn't allowed. I guess I'm feeling a bit lost, I'm trying to avoid disordered eating but based on this sub, majority of the other sibs are bad? Does CICO work?

For me, the timing couldn't have been better to discover this sub. For the last months, I have become increasingly desperate, feeling so helpless because I don't know what a normal diet is supposed to look like anymore.


After my brief dance with drunkorexia in my late teens, my weight has been creeping up and up and up to the point of obesity, and that's where I'm at right now.
I've struggled with my weight for years, and tried what seems to be every diet under the sun: low carb, whole 30, CICO, you name it.  


Last year, I've managed to lose 30ish pounds with CICO, OMAD and a shit ton of walking. My calorie intake was restricted to 1200 kcal a day because that's what my stupid-ass sanity-loss app deemed appropriate for a pEtiTe sEdEntArY woman in her late twenties. Yeah the weight melted off fast, but ofc it wasn't sustainable, the urge to binge on sweets and snacks after my OMAD became overwhelming and I couldn't wait till my OMAD in the evening, I started ""caving in"" and eating something at noon. And because I felt like a failure, I binged on those ""forbidden"" lunches. I felt so gross. 


This sub made me realize: NO SHIT I was binging. It was not because I sucked at IF, but because my body was kinda sorta trying to stay alive? And maybe I wouldn't have to binge if I wasn't ashamed of needing more food? But I also totally drank the ""you don't need food if you have fat cells"" kool-aid. I


My relationship with food is so messed up that anything more than OMAD automatically registers as too much. Right now, my heart is racing because I've had three! whole! meals! today (porridge for breakfast, pasta with shrimps and mushrooms for lunch, salad with feta cheese for dinner) and according to my goblin brain, I might as well stuff my face with candy because three meals a day is tOo mUCh. Having followed so many fad diet over the years has really messed with my head, I have so many weird rules around food. And the thought of not weighing myself every day gives me anxiety, because what if the weight just keeps creeping up? I mean, it does anyway, but what if I gain even more when I'm not watching it? 


All this food obsession, and not even a thin body to show for it. It sucks. 


What now? How can I unlearn decades of unhealthy diet culture and return to a healthy weight? I just want to have a normal relationship with food. I want to slay the ED dragon. Where do I start?"

Disordered,"Thank you r/DietTea for existing!  TLDR AT BOTTOM 

This sub very well may have just prevented me from entering a weight obsessed depressive episode. 

Context… I have GAD and MDD, as well as a bunch of smaller insecurities that are loud sometimes. I’ve been in therapy for six years and medicated for two years. I experienced some disordered eating habits in high school, and some of these habits popped in and out throughout college (1 more year!). I didn’t lose enough weight or harm my body enough to be considered an eating disorder, which looking back I’m thankful for. But at the time, I felt without that diagnosis then I was a failure and wouldn’t lose weight. This is all because of the #ProAna that was popular in 2010s. This community promoted and glorified eating disorders and often swapped “tips and tricks” to lose weight, as well as diet plans and rules. Honestly, I could write a paper on this from memory if I wanted to, explaining just how damaging the community was. But I was obsessed with it in high school. 

Back to today, I’m on vacation with family and I have tinnitus so sleeping in silence is close to impossible. I was watching Impractical Jokers before bed and left the TV on. I woke up to a diet program infomercial. I wasn’t paying attention to it, but my subconscious was. I found myself searching for proana on Reddit and this sub popped up. I was expecting it to be about diet teas, but after going through it, I’m glad it’s not. It snapped me out of looking for bad habits to try to lose weight. It was a wake up call or reality check. Like hey, maybe you don’t have to do that. Maybe just drink some more water today and go for a walk. 


TLDR - A diet program infomercial triggered my dormant disordered eating habits, but after searching for proana, this sub popped up and stopped me from entering a weight obsessed depressive episode."

**NB - I wish to emphasise beforehand that I am going to go in-depth in some sensitive subjects here like ED and abuse. So if there is the chance that you can be triggered about this, please read at your own discretion. Also, if you are struggling through some of the issues that I am about to mention, please consult with an expert. It is the best choice for your health and safety.**

I am not diagnosed with an eating disorder ... not officially anyway.

I did however get diagnosed with an ED (anorexia nervosa) about 10 years ago and while I managed to get a hold of this puzzling battle, there are a few symptoms and temptations that still linger.

Though it is more complicated than that because my understanding of ED-like habits are similar to actual habits that can become obsessive. This is also the case that I have lived with an abusive family for the majority of my life and their behaviours, while I understand that they mean good intentions, paradoxically reinforce my habits even more and they are not (or choose not to) to self-aware that their actions of control, abuse, and emotional manipulation and power struggles actually reinforce my habits even more because I learned that a major theme in EDs is the theme of control.

So I have been secretly and silently battling against or trying to be aware or coming to terms with these habits for many, many, many years and to actually admit that I still struggle with these habits is a big struggle in itself because it quite literally feels like I am coming out of the closet when I do.

And I feel that this is even more emphasised by two things - my family continuously reinforce my habits and even though they mean to help me in the best way that they can, the way they do them is very unhealthy and almost abusive (gaslighting, emotional guilt-tripping, power struggles, criminalisation and stigmatization and so on); and also, because I seriously think that society (in general) reinforce these unhealthy habits and provoke us into ending up in eating disorders, whether intentional or unintentional. (which is a topic that is rarely spoken publically in-depth about)

And this is the part that I really want to focus on.

&#x200B;

**INTRO**

So I am having a bit of a dilemma here.

I have this argument that the whole concept of aesthetics and body fat which are really think that risks bridging or provoking people who develop unhealthy levels of self-esteem because of how these body images are marketed. I am not saying that this is done intentionally but a lot of marketing that I am familiar with promote these things in ways that consequently ""promote"" unhealthy disorders

I have this argument that these ambitions are mostly there for marketing purposes and do not have that much impact on sports performance even though aesthetics is the most attractive feature when people start to go to the gym and be more strict with their diet. I am saying this because I have in the fitness hobby for a long time now (good and bad ... it is a complicated story)

My argument is that these pressures on looking good when it comes to performing sports or fitness, in general, is just an unhealthy standard and the way we are pushed to achieve this is paradoxically unhealthy and not in line with our desires of performing well in our sport and living healthily.

&#x200B;

So much so, that I think this promotes or provokes people to end up with unhealthy habits or eating disorders (whether done intentionally or not because I am aware that the fitness industry is a business with many shades of grey - though I have to highlight that there is a lot of shady practices that I do not think that many people are aware of or speak openly about)

That being said, I must admit that even I have this pressure to look the part when I do a certain exercise or sport because whenever I see an athlete (Crossfit is the type of sport that I am currently doing), they tend to be a balanced mix between being chiselled and lean but also strong and athletic. And yes, there is a chance that they do this through a lot of strict dieting or perhaps with the use of PEDs.

&#x200B;

**BACKGROUND**

I also take a large portion of my time to focus on my diet - macros ratio, looking into scientific research to tackle my satiation, my recovery, my hunger and appetite, stress level and sleep quality, level of focus or even satisfaction and so on.

(and yes, I am very attentive on this part because the science is broad and I do not wish to fall for pseudo-science or what we often call ""bro-science"". Not only that, but my experience told me that if we are not self-aware, we might do whatever method that fits our desperation and not realise that we end up taking things too far, let alone that there are the risks that these diets or recommendations may not be supported by valid nutrition and sport science)

Still, it is an attractive feature to look the part and I work really hard on my performance and to follow the diet that I use (and I am experimenting because I know that this whole subject of dieting is huge and bizarre)

(aside from the other themes that are related to the theme of ""control"" in EDs because it is a misconception that people think that it is only because people want to look good or achieve certain goals related to health or fitness)

&#x200B;

I have been into the fitness hobby (sometimes it is a hobby, sometimes it is routine) for years now and while I am not an expert by any means, I developed a lot of interest in the fitness and nutrition subject, particularly in the niche aspects regarding health.

And something that I really learned is that the whole thing of ""health"" is really broad and while there are standards that have been shown to promote good health and well-being (such as fighting against obesity and other health problems in relation of certain diets, fitness or lifestyles, or certain diets promoting or reinforcing physical or mental health), I learned that the subject is complicated and really controversial too.

And from my understanding, this is also why we have a whole plethora of different diets and philosophies where the science is murky and we end up trying or falling for all kinds of programs and other things.

&#x200B;

**THE MAIN RANT - BUSINESS AND SOCIETY**

This is where I am a bit confused and sometimes angry too.

I do understand that fitness has a business behind it - good, bad and everything in between and do not wish to say that all business that is related to this subject is all bad.

Though at the same time, I am getting the impression that the lack of concreteness in this field is so prominent that I am not sure what is a good way of dieting or programming your diet and fitness schedule to fit your goals, or whether these are things that are being marketed in clever ways that trick into something.

And I am getting the impression that it is affecting your expectations of us or our understanding of what we think of what our ideal selves should be or what is the ideal health.

For example, I am aware that fitness is ""promoted"" a lot in Hollywood and the standards (which are mostly aesthetic) are often very apparent in Hollywood and have a huge effect of what people look for when they want to look or live in a certain way. This is also the case that America also has a large obesity issue where most of its food portions are large and unhealthily processed, and some of the insight that I found was that the way that some actors and models achieved these physiques in such short periods also raises a lot of flags.

But nonetheless, because of our desperation, we end up falling for our own hedonic desires and at the same time, I am getting the impression that these standards are either way too high, can only be achieved for a short-term and can be very unhealthy, and/or at the same time, our demands and needs to reach certain standards are distracted by so many temptations and another plethora of messages that give us so many confusing emotions about many things.

Like wanting to lose weight but the availability of so many products, good, bad, sugary or not, are easy and either affordable or are not. Or at times, we are also marketed to eat healthily all the time where I think that we are encouraged to follow these ""health diets"" to the letter and avoid the ""tempting"" bad side at all costs.

And in conclusion to all of this, all of these confusing puzzles and messages and double standards in fitness, diet or even standards in society, I am getting the impression that we are ending up falling victim to a lot of unhealthy habits and possibly even eating disorders like anorexia or orthorexia or even depression or OCD.

&#x200B;

I can only say this based on personal perception and personal experience because I fell these temptations many times and I even fell victim to an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) almost 10 years ago and I still feel its effects and my judgement tells me that a part of it because of these such high standards that we have to live up to and if we do not manage, or because of the plethora of other messages and contradictions that we get, we end up falling to extremes or deep depressions that it is as though it is the end of the world when in reality, this is based on the expectations of certain ideals like bodily self-esteem or aesthetic which changes from time to time or from culture to culture.

&#x200B;

**THE MAIN RANT - PERSONAL AMBITIONS**

Now I have been working on losing a tiny bit of my body fat for the sake of aesthetic purposes.

(I will not delve into this because I do not want to trigger anyone. It is only a tiny bit of body fat and nothing more) and I understand that losing body fat is pretty hard when you have been working out for so long, especially if the amount of body fat that you have left is not much.

Now I looked into all the factors that I can gather - diet, sleep schedule, stress levels, my daily activity, my lifestyle, my occupation and so on.

&#x200B;

I know that I am not perfect and this is going to take a long time.

But I slowly realised that I was starting to feel frustrated, possibly even going insane or desperate when I started to feel that I cannot achieve what I am aiming for.

It started to make me feel hopeless but at the same time, it is opening my eyes because I am reflecting on this and figuring out why this is important, at least to me.

&#x200B;

Because I am also battling with my own ideas of living a healthy life and not just sticking to my diet and program to the letter because I do not want to risk delving into an eating disorder of some kind (I already had one 10 years ago and the effects still linger, especially because the theme of discipline and consistency constantly mix and can easily confuse with obsession and rigidness) like orthorexia (which I think that many athletes struggle with this or that the fitness industry promotes the need to eat healthily so much that we end up developing these ""healthy"" obsessions) or some other unhealthy mental habit (as I also struggle with those as well).

&#x200B;

I know that life is much more than fitness, diet and anything related to this lifestyle even though they form a huge part of my life (and many people promote this for the sake of health .... mostly) and at the same time, I am reflecting on this because I remember that a major reason as to why I wanted to or even continue to exercise is because of this ambition to achieve a certain physique.

I know that my gut tells me that aesthetics are subjective and the concept of the ideal body image changes from time to time or from culture to culture, let alone that the concept of health is also ambiguous too.

But at the same time, possibly because of peer pressure or because of the power of marketing, I also want to achieve this ""ideal"" look, even though my gut tells me that this is only a dream, something that I can hope to achieve but cannot really achieve at its 100% or can only be done by very strict dieting and consistency for months or even years.

&#x200B;

There is a chance that this is also because when I have been working hard for a long time and when you have some fat left (I am not that low, almost 12% to 13% body fat), it gets harder to remove that unneeded fat. But in the end, that struggle gives me a sense of failure and even desperation and I have been reflecting on this and trying to understand why the hell am I pressuring myself so much about this just because I get to see a tiny bit of muscle when I do not know if I am going to be able to keep it like that all year around or whether it will affect my performance or my happiness.

&#x200B;

**DOES IT REALLY MATTER?**

The last part is what I want to highlight - why do I want my happiness to be so dependent based on a tiny need/want on how I want to look like?

And I am asking, does this really matter in the end?

Is this ambition to look the part actually affect one's happiness in the long run? Does the advertisement of the before and after photos where you find this average person becoming more muscular or aesthetically pleasing and beautiful actually have a better quality of life or more recognition and respect and so on? Or is it all just a myth?

&#x200B;

**TLDR - I am getting the impression that the health industry is paradoxically promoting a lot of unhealthy standards that are (directly or indirectly) promoting unhealthy behaviours or disorders.**

**Do the overall body fat and body image in fitness have an effect on not just one's performance but also self-esteem, satisfaction and happiness?**

**Does the archetypical advert of the average person being changed into a more aesthetically pleasing thing actually have a better quality of life or is it a myth?**"
Disordered,wtf?  
Disordered,Okay I know they had good intentions but-  
Disordered,Are these people for real? How can you boot users who had an ED in the past while simultaneously encouraging this??  
Disordered,I am horrified.  
Disordered,Guy on tiktok lost 100 pounds in 6 months and a majority of the comments are saying that this is a healthy rate of weight loss and get bothered if anyone says he probably didn’t do it healthily. Yikes  
Disordered,Tell me this is fake  
Disordered,"I just found my new favorite podcast and it's about diet myths  Since I do most of my job when the business is closed and need constant entertainment to fill the howling void, I listen to a *concerning* amount of podcast content. So I'm always looking for new things, and now I'm mad I didn't find [Maintenance Phase](http://maintenancephase.com/) sooner. It's all about junk science, diet myths, etc. and after literally 1/4 of an episode I was in love. (I arbitrarily started with the ""School Lunches, P-Hacking, and the Original Pizzagate"" episode, if that's relevant.)

It's two hosts, which can be hit or miss but they're low on banter and high on obvious personal connection, which is just about perfect. Diligent research, much saltiness, and lots of swears. It's so good.


Anyway, I just wanted to share since it's very on-theme, go give it a listen if podcasts are your thing too!"
Disordered,What the fuck? (tw!)

Disordered,🙄  
Disordered,DAE sometimes find the volume sub wild? Like you do all these tricks and steps to make - 33g - of oats more filling when you could just eat more bc you're only eating a tiny amount. Idk it feels odd.  
Disordered,Not too related to dieting but I figured y'all might have some interesting thoughts on this. A law was recently put out in Portugal forbidding the sale of a number of foods on school cafeterias. While I do agree it's a good measure to a certain level I think they went a bit too far  
Disordered,what the actual flip  
Disordered,All comments were apprehensive but none were telling them not to (peep OP’s edit 💀)  
Disordered,If u know u know  
Disordered,I think this is a little disordered there literally worrying about artificial flavoring

Disordered,YouTube is wild  
Disordered,"Fitness influencer’s FDOE. She claims she eats “a lot” and used to say she would eat at least 2k/day. This is not near that.  **TW for calorie estimations on last photo in link!!!!**: https://imgur.com/a/jCv91Of

I’ve posted about this girl before. I have no issue with her posting about her life, but I DO have an issue with her showing her diet + lifestyle like it’s sustainable and achievable for everyone. She is 17-18 (I forget which) & it is clear from her comments that people look up to her. By saying she eats plenty, it is harming ppl who may see her content and think, “oh, this is normal. That’s plenty of food.” She’s not directly saying to eat like her, but you get my point. She’s also the one who said “fast food is gross and unhealthy” in the same breath and saying that she “doesn’t care how you eat.” 

She tried bulking a while ago but then went back to her usual diet because she said it made her hair fall out. Also she is currently trying pescatarianism. Lastly, she eats two protein bars in this WIEIAD but has said before that she only has one a day when replying to someone’s comment about it.🤔

Oh, and on top of this she does a thirty minute ab-workout, runs 4 miles, and goes to the gym. After viewing her IG story, I cannot watch her anymore. I like her other content bc she’s energetic and I’ve watched her for a good bit but the food stuff is way too triggering.

eta: also she’s 5’7” for anyone wondering in relation to cals"
Disordered,apparently hiking for 3 days while fasting for 10 is an achievement of sorts  
Disordered,This is all kinds of wrong (tw : numbers)  
Disordered,(TW NUMBERS) Found in counting sub with nothing but praise in the comments. This is so sad :(  
Disordered,"fat people all have EDs and undiagnosed ""psychiatric conditions""  "
Disordered,"maybe, hear me out, eat carbs and stop damaging your body  "
Disordered,Oooh wait- So suddenly fasting isn't as natural as they preach? Our ancestors were glucose slaves too?  
Disordered,I looked up an article about cellulite to reassure someone that it’s just a normal part of having skin and it’s not unhealthy or dangerous. Article had this thumbnail of an ass and thighs…. without any cellulite 😶  
Disordered,you ate food therefore binged  
Disordered,I have no words. Reported it for self harm  
Disordered,why do they get so mad about people needing clothes  
Disordered,umm.. this isn't normal is it? literally drugged myself with benadryl when I was deep into my ED...

Disordered,"more recovery content on the We Don't Hate Fatties, We Hate Their Brains sub  "
Disordered,I am concerned…  
Disordered,I don't mean to rag on OP here but they are literally sending food items to get tested and then sharing the results with reddit and it is high key triggering  
Disordered,i don't think thats a good way to handle a plateau..  
Disordered,ridiculous comments on a video about eating disorders.  
Disordered,Amirite my fellow 5'4 petites  
Disordered,"""cravings"" and ""dopamine"" and ""trust your handy calorie calculator""  fuck everyone who says this

""it's actually just a craving brush your teeth""

""you can't trust your body, it just wants that dopamine hit from eating""

""you're a food addict and your body has gotten used to constantly being fed""

nope couldn't be **hunger** gotta be food addiction or whatever the new bullshit is, doesn't matter *what* food you want (the huge dopamine hit of fruits and vegetables, am I right), it's always YOU CAN'T TRUST NATURAL HUNGER AND SATIETY CUES WHIP OUT MYFITNESSPAL TO VERIFY IF YOU REALLY DESERVE MORE FOOD

I look at these fucking dieting subs and they're obsessed, totally obsessed, with eating nutrient-poor junk food and staying within their caloric limit. 800 cals of dairy queen leaves me 400 more for dinner, what should I do? I'm going to OMAD two big macs at mcdonald's

maybe

*maybe*

eating that unsatisfying, chemical-and-additive-laden crap is why you're always craving more food: because your body is starving for nutrients"

Disordered,How do I keep from fainting? Electrolytes. Always with the electrolytes. Are these people sponsored by Brawndo?

Disordered,Sanity in the comments of a post by OP asking what to do about a binge... OP is a child  
Disordered,"Diet tea from my doctor  So I went to my primary care doctor office for a medication refill. My last doctor (who I really liked and had great bedside manner) retired in the fall, so they gave me a new one. I went in, 20 pounds heavier than last year at this time, and I asked the doctor if weight gain or increased appetite was a side effect of my medication. I also expressed that I was experiencing bad binging episodes sporadically for the first time in my life (like eat the entire kitchen of readily available food and even eats-2-lbs-of-carrots-in-one-sitting-because-I-just-need-to-be-consuming binging). Even my husband has noticed a change.

He proceeds to tell me (F27, borderline ow/obese) that >!""It only takes an extra one or two bites at the end of a meal to gain weight. Next time you want more chicken or an extra slice of pizza, think about that before you keep eating"". And then rattled off some story about a woman drinking a Pepsi every work day and gaining 15 pounds at the end of the year.!<

What. The. Actual. Fuck. An extra two bites?? In what kind of world are people gaining 20 pounds in a year due to 4-6 extra bites of food per day? I'm 100% positive it's the BINGING that caused my weight gain, but he wouldn't have that conversation with me.

Super hecking annoyed that I'll have to pay for this visit because 'Merica. 

And he switched my medication to something with weight loss as a side effect. FML."
Disordered,Everyone in the comments where congratulating him for his 60lbs weightloss in 15 weeks despite how he’s clearly eating less calories then what he needs for healthy weightloss :/  
Disordered,maybe fasting for a few days isn’t the best idea then?
