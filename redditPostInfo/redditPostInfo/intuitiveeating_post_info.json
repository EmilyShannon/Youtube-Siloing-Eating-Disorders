It had a weight limit, and I haven\'t weighed myself in three months. Last time I weighed myself I was below the limit, but obviously I didn\'t want to break the zipline and fall, so I weighed myself on a scale they had. I asked my friend to tell me simply if it was above or below the weight limit, which he did (I was above) And then, against my better judgement, I instinctively glanced down, and saw my weight.\n\nI\'m not as upset as I would\'ve been by it going up a year ago, but it still upset me to see a specific number. I feel really guilty and ashamed for looking down at the number after such a long time not weighing myself. It was also kind of embarrassing to not be able to go on the zipline.\n\nThe worst part was I was literally only a few lbs above the weight limit, and it was late in the day, so I started doing all these calculations. Like how much my clothes weigh how much my shoes weigh how much I\'d weigh in the morning. All these calculations because I wanted to convince myself my weight gain had been minimal. My IE dietitian tells me that it\'s okay to want to lose weight, because society is so fatphobic, but to not act on those desires, but I still feel really guilty whenever I get upset by my weight gain. I just wish I\'d never looked down at the scale. And now I really want to weigh myself "properly" in the morning naked. (Thankfully, I don\'t own a scale so this is impossible. I threw it out months ago) I just feel so stupid for making that mistake, and I\'d really convinced myself I was done gaining weight, but that\'s not the case. I will say, the weight gain seems to have slowed down a bit, which I imagine means I will stabilize soon, but I think it\'s just brought to the forefront how much I want to lose weight, even 9 months into my journey.

I just felt the need to share a win for me, and the process that has led to this win! I have no idea how to spoiler / trigger warn properly, but I will be talking about binging, restriction, a bit about weight indirectly, etc.\n\n>!Growing up with undiagnosed autism meant that I didn't have a whole lot of claim to popularity. On the contrary, I was a tiny and very awkward boy, and I was frequently bullied. My mother wasn't exactly a health nut, but she wasn't a fan of fast food either. She would constantly urge me to eat more, and encourage my eating in many ways. When a McDonald's opened in our little town, all of my classmates were ecstatic. They had many children's birthdays there, and of course, being the nerdy awkward small autistic boy in the class I wasn't invited. It is easy to see, in hindsight, how the experience of McDonald's ended up on a bit of a pedestal for me. It became an entry ticket in my mind, a ticket to popularity just like adidas was for clothing brands, and owning a gameboy was sure to make me one of the cool kids. Yet it was strictly forbidden in our household, and I am sure you can all see where this is going.\n\n>!Fast forward a few years, and alcohol had entered the picture. It became almost a totem for me. It dulled my senses, loosened my tongue, and made me not care about my awkwardness. It was an entry-ticket into a sense of community. I didn't really believe, on any level, that I was worth talking to unless I was drunk. And as you can imagine that necessitated a lot of hangovers.\n\n>!My cousin and I would drink a lot, and would live close to eachother when I finally moved out. It became kind of a fun ritual we had together: Every time we had hangovers, we would go to McDonald's. And in a sort of stupid masculine kind of dare, we would always urge eachother to eat as much as possible, and laugh about it. For me it was fine, because I had always been told to eat more, so I prided myself in it. When hungover, it is natural to feel like shit, to feel slightly anxious, stressed out, and sorry for yourself. And when hungover, the salt and fat helps make you feel better. And so, in those years, McDonald's became associated with treating those feelings of stress, anxiety, and self-pity in my mind.\n\n>!I would soon find myself binging on McDonald's whenever I felt like shit. It wasn't just about McDonald's either, it was other fast food too. Pepperoni pizza slices with lots of dressing. I don't really remember much of the taste of these things, other than an intense craving for a salt/sweet/fat mixture, and how it had to go down as fast as possible. It felt like I was actually treating my poor state of mind and body. Either treating myself and medicating my hangover, or dealing with stress, anxiety, and sadness that had occured in other ways. But as my alcoholism worsened, I started drinking alone and drinknig harder, so my binging sessions increased. In the end all taste of these escapades had mostly disappeared. I felt like going nuts on fast food was just how I attempted to return to a normal, or return to those days where I would hang out with my cousin, rather than sit and drink alone in the dark in front of my computer. I was chasing a memory that was long gone.\n\n>!Discovering IE, I would continue that cycle - yet be mindful of the process. That is how I discovered all of the underlying reasons why I would binge so much on it: The alcohol, the stress, the anxiety, a desire to cope, a hidden desire for popularity stemming from my childhood, as well as the conformity of performing the same ritual which is nice when you're autistic. I kind of came to accept it for what it was, but couldn't really cope until I quit drinking.\n\n>!Today it is 37 days since I quit drinking, and I visited McDonald's for the first time since quitting. I bought a happy meal for our two kids on the backseat (Half of it was thrown allover the car, obviously), but my oldest didn't want the cheeseburger. So I said I'd eat it, along with my salad. My wife had some homestyle special burger.\n\n>!I took one bite of the cheeseburger, this time with my memories in mind. Knowing all the unconscious associations I've had with McDonald's over the years. Mindfully chewed on it, and tasted it. I could taste a bit of the red dressing, which tasted slightly sugary and sweet, but other than that the burger tasted like nothing to me. The bread was dry and turned to mush in my mouth, the patty was kind of crumbly and fatty and slightly salty. I wasn't impressed. So I left it and decided to focus on my salad, which was quite good.\n\n>!My wife, meanwhile, had enough of her burger and asked if I wanted to swap, as it was too spicy for her. I love spicy food, so I happily accepted. Again, it didn't taste like all that much to me, other than spicy, fatty, and a bit salty from the bacon. The spice triggered my desire to eat faster, probably a kind of unconscious desire to get the spicy stuff out of the way as soon as possible, and I swallowed a couple of large chunks of the burger which made me feel uncomfortable when it went down. Yet that is how I used to eat all fast foods back in my binging days. Swallowing, barely chewing. Yet today, it was quite uncomfortable. I finished the burger anyway, even though it wasn't really giving me much in terms of taste, and I was left with a kind of blocky heavy feeling in my stomach. I felt full in an uncomfortable way. I used to binge 4 burgers of that size in one sitting but today only half a burger would make me feel slightly uncomfortable. I am really happy with how in tune I have become with my body, now that alcohol isn't dulling every sense.\n\nI don't think I have experienced anything quite as disillusioning before. And thinking back on all the other times I had eaten there, I began to realize that the only thing I actually really enjoyed from McDonald's was the dressings. The sweet and sour dip, the big mac dressing, and of course having it mixed with something with umami and salt. But without the hangover, without the self-pity, and without anything to relieve - it didn't taste of anything to me.\n\nGoing forward, I might eat McDonald's again, but I will probably stick to the salad. In case I do feel emotionally out of whack, I might eat there again, or I might go for a walk or play some video games."}, {'Disordered': 'Help  First of all, I have no idea if this is what the rules say should have a TW but I put it just in case. \n\nWhenever I try IE for a while (about 1 month last time) , I unintentionally do the opposite of gaining weight.

Of course I was angry, moody and genuinely in the worst place I’ve mentally ever been in. But fasting was my way to be in control. I had even done several 48 hour fasts and a single 72 hour fast. Even in my failed attempts, I would always fail at the 24 hour mark (that too because of mental temptation, never because of physical hunger) and I am not proud to admit it but whenever my sister used to say that she’s very hungry in the morning and cannot skip breakfast, I used to make fun of her. (She is my IE role model, has naturally practiced IE all her life and as a result of that, has maintained a very healthy weight throughout) I could not fathom how someone could get hungry in just a few hours when I was doing multiple day fasts. Looking back, I was very insensitive - Don’t get me wrong, I love my sister immensely and always have, but I just couldn’t understand it. Fast forward to now, when I’m doing IE for recovery - I am so much happier mentally and physically. Now, of course there are days where I tend to treat IE as a diet and can fall into the last supper binge mentality but I am actively working on it and my binges have reduced considerably. However my interesting observation is that ever since I started IE, I get SO ravenous even if I accidentally skip a single meal. I feel physical symptoms of hunger and feel nauseous even if I attempt to fast. It is so funny to me that I get hungry - literally feel it in my body and am incapable of doing anything else if I don’t eat first. Because I would have never imagined that in the past. Don’t get me wrong, I love it and I absolutely love that this means that I’ve regained my body’s trust back.\nThink about it this way, I used to calorie count and fast because I didn’t respect my body enough to trust it’s natural cues so it stopped giving them. However now that I’m back to honouring it and trusting my body again, these cues have significantly increased and are so much louder now.\nSo for any of those on the fence that think IE  wouldn’t ’work’ for them because they don’t feel hunger, allow your body to regain that trust. IE is the way humans were always supposed to eat. Just like a baby cries when it’s hungry, your body will convey that to you too.'}, {'Recovery': 'I figured out that what I was actually craving was bread, not sweets  Hi everyone! I\'m new to IE and I\'m about halfway through the book. About two weeks ago I started working with food-related parts somatically and through Internal Family Systems therapy. I have a history of smoking weed and binge eating, and over the past few months this has gotten worse. During the day, I would artificially limit how many carbs I would let myself eat and avoid wheat/gluten, and subconsciously force myself to eat more meat with my meals than I actually wanted to. At night, I would go for "forbidden" foods like ice cream, cakes, and fast food.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'ve noticed my tastes shift significantly after starting IE. Since nighttime was the only time I would let myself eat high carb foods, I would go for sweets and fast food to make it "worth it". But after starting IE, I\'ve been going for all the high carb foods that I haven\'t eaten in years because they don\'t fit with paleo/keto style diets and also because they\'re not "forbidden" enough for me to want them during a binge - stuff like whole grain toast with almond butter. I had a Mediterranean salad bowl topped with hummus and chickpeas and pita bread and didn\'t bother finishing the chicken in the bowl and instead ate it with extra pita bread. I find myself craving hummus and pita bread with lots of olive oil.  This is making me think that my late night "sweet tooth" was a result of not eating enough carbs during the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'m so sick of how much meat I\'ve been eating, too - for the past year I\'ve made myself eat at least 6 oz of meat with lunch and dinner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast night I even went for a walk during the time I normally do my netflix-and-snacking thing.

Postpartum, however, I suddenly had all of this room in my belly and I am finding it difficult to actually reach a sensation of fullness. On top of this, I find that my appetite while breastfeeding is virtually bottomless. I feel ravenous all day long despite eating in abundance. \n\n\\-As a stay at home mom, gone are the days of having time to sit and have a leisurely meal- most of my meals are eaten quickly and with little awareness while simultaneously tending to a baby. It doesn't feel realistic to be able to set aside time to eat every single meal in peace & pay attention to my physical sensations. This limited time for eating has also led to emotional eating- when I do have a minute to myself, I have the urge to eat all of the food I can get my hands on as a form of self soothing or self care and then end up feeling guilty after the fact. \n\n\\-I have had to eliminate the top 12 allergens from my diet due to my baby having several protein intolerance while breastfeeding... the restriction has been incredibly triggering for me and it also perpetuates a fixation over food because I am having to track/read labels all day long.

Having it be a choice - to actively choose that I want to enjoy food now, even though I have alternatives that are no less good for me - really makes a difference.

TW: Mentions specific dieting and weight loss.\n\nFirst time posting here as I’ve just found this sub. I’ll start off by saying my issues with binging date back to some of my earliest memories. I used to eat so much at restaurants instead of bringing home leftovers and would come home and throw it up in the middle of the night as young as 5 or 6 years old because I overate so much and my parents would be angry with me and I think that’s what started my unhealthy relationship with food. I was a big kid from 7 or 8 to 17-18with many times dieting and failing in between. As a high schooler I would eat normal throughout the day and then come home from school and eat so much I got sick and part of me would be happy I did cause then I could eat more. At the beginning of my senior year of high school I started keto and lost about 100 lbs in 4-5 months, obviously this is really unhealthy and wasn’t sustainable but at the time I thought it was and that I had healed my relationship with food. I stayed on keto for 3 years and then decided to cheat once. Ate some pizza and was good, but had another cheat meal the next week, and then I couldn’t go a week without a cheat meal, it slowly turned into ill make Sunday my cheat day so I can just have what I want. Then it turned into “eh Saturday night is close enough to sunday” and before I knew it I was eating terribly every day in copious amounts, at crazy times, going to fast food on a daily basis and I couldn’t control it no matter what I tried to do. Over the course of the last year I gained 100 lbs back and was at the same weight I started at before keto for 3 whole years. I was obviously very upset with myself and still am but I ended up going back to keto and I’ve now been keto for 4 months again and lost 25 lbs this time but I constantly have this cloud of impending doom over me that if I eat one thing that isn’t keto I’ll go nuts and completely ruin any progress I’ve made which is par for the course with BED, restrict to binge to guilt. I’m trying to get off of keto and start intuitively eating so I can have the things I want but not go completely off the rails with them and also not have to only eat keto things at all times and most importantly I want a healthy relationship with food, I don’t want it to control my life and be self conscious all the time about my weight or my eating. I feel like I’m so good with food for months and then when I have one “bad food” and I’m right back to square one. I don’t even know what normal hunger queues feel like. I haven’t even stopped binging with keto, I just binge on keto foods and they tend to be less calories so I don’t end up gaining weight but I’m definitely not losing any weight. So what steps do I take to get in touch with what my body needs and to understand my body again? How do I intuitively eat if I have no food intuition? What should I be doing before/during/after eating to stop myself from feeling guilty and spiraling into binging regularly? I’m very worried that wanting to intuitively eat is just something I’m telling myself to have a chance to get off keto and just go back to my old ways, but I also know staying on keto forever isn’t going to work and I’m going to have to try to fix this relationship with food no matter how long I try to not face it. \n\nTLDR: Always heavy as a kid, lost 100lbs with keto, thought my relationship with food was healed after 3 years of keto without a single cheat meal. Had one cheat meal and it spiraled into daily binging and I gained 100lbs back.

Perhaps the most amazing (at least for me) is that you can heal your inner child in the pool!!! I used to L-O-V-E the pool. BEG my mom to take me. PLEAD to stay longer playing mermaids n shit. And now, I can waltz on down there whenever I do please and just…play! I can do laps, kick around, flap my arms, play some good ole Find-The-Coin at the bottom of the pool…the options are endless. You could bring a friend and play catch or volleyball, throw a torpedo around, do cannonballs, whatever. (All this to say as long as you aren’t disturbing other swimmers.) \n\nBut that leads me to the next best thing! It’s almost ALWAYS empty. So you can act like a buffoon in total privacy, usually. \n\nYou can do water aerobics, stretch, work on balance, all in the very gentle, buoyant water. It’s much easier on the joints and you can move your entire body underwater without having to see how silly you look! (That’s another perk- no mirrors)\n\nLastly, one of the best perks is the *chef’s kiss* temperature regulation. If you hate sweating this is a GREAT option. Sure you’ll get all wet, but you don’t have to deal with that feeling of a single droplet of sweat running down your asscrack, or having pit stains, or any of that nonsense. \n\nAnyways, I just am very excited about my new hobby and wanted to give it a shameless plug.

I was working with IE book by E. Tribole and E. Resch.  Normally I'm not thinking about food much and eat mostly what I want. This part got more difficult when I got diagnosis of high cholesterol so I need to limit saturated fats and unprocessed sugar. This also works somehow for me, I tell myself it's part of self-care. But. Recently I decided to stop drinking alcohol completely in order to improve my sleep (but also I felt I was becoming to dependent on it even though I had usually only 1 drink a day). I joined a reddit sub for people trying to stop drinking and I see a lot of people writing how ditching alcohol makes you lose weight... suddenly it threw me back into wishing I was smaller even though I thought I came to terms with my weight which is mostly stable now but of course higher than during my past dieting years. And suddenly Facebook started to show me weightloss/fitness commercials again 😑. How do you function in other internet communities that idealise weightloss?"}, {'Disordered': 'Going to the gym when there are other people there?  I recently moved to a new city and my entire joyful movement routine has been uprooted. My old apartment complex had a gym room that no one used and I found lots of joy and pleasure in using the weightlifting machines and equipment. Now that I’ve moved, the only free gym I have access to is the university I’ll be working for’s athletic center. I’m really not used to working out in front of lots of people and I’m concerned that people might stare or ridicule me for using the weightlifting equipment. Especially because college athletes will be there. Does anyone have some suggestions on how to use the gym without worrying about all the hyper fit people that will likely be there? I know this is more an anxiety situation than an intuitive eating situation, but I feel like other people here might have some perspective.

A lot of you have a lot of experience with gaining weight when starting intuitive eating, and I\'ve gained quite a bit since fully committing myself to my journey, so I\'m probably over 250 lbs at the moment. The thing that is weird to me though is I\'m not really eating more than normal? Like at the beginning I understood because I wasn\'t feeding myself properly, but now that I\'ve balanced out more, I\'m not really sure where this weight is coming from. It was always one of my pain points during the ED phase that I could barely lose weight but I always gained it really easily. I guess for reference my weight was 180 in the past (and therefore I was "obese" according to the BMI chart, but now when I look back at photos I see how thin I really was and it\'s so crazy) My bloodwork is perfectly healthy and I even got an extra thyroid test because I was concerned about that as well. I think I mostly just wanted support tbh. It\'s been hard being in my body as of late and I don\'t really have many people in my life who enjoy being in larger bodies so it\'s stressful.'}, {'Disordered': 'getting into IE with background of parental restriction/secretive binges…  so i grew up in the kind of environment where my dad would be mad at me whenever i eat/buy snacks, esp sweets. he just wants me to be healthy but it created this really weird relationship I have with food. \n\nI have no idea what is/is not okay to eat. I don’t at all understand my hunger (only that I’m okay to eat when we go out to eat/food is made, and not okay when my dad yells at me for eating). \n\nWhen I’m with my parents and they’re okay with me eating a certain food (I’m an adult btw), I feel fine about eating it. Most times it’s a no/reluctant yes. Hence when I’m alone/find time to be alone, I find myself ordering way too much and wanting everything. I did not grow up with not enough food or anything, but there’s almost always this intense craving for foods that I can’t beat. \n\nAnd, it’s not like I eat way too much. I definitely overeat when I’m eating secretively, but I never finish everything I buy, I just don’t feel fine without it. There’s so much guilt afterwards too. \n\nThe fat phobia I experience/the wanting to diet definitely don’t help.

I’d like to take my time with food to really enjoy it. However, my partner eats extremely quickly. I find myself drawn into his pace at meals (we eat dinner together every day) and I end up eating more quickly than I want to, as well as responding to the feeling of scarcity, like he is going to eat everything and I won’t get enough. \n\nI really don’t want to ask him to eat differently because that feels like a violation of my ethics around food.

Is it okay to just graze all day?  So I come from a background of struggling with an ED but consider myself mostly recovered now, and trying to work out how to eat intuitively as I don\'t want to have to eat a meal plan for the rest of my life. I\'m also autistic, and struggle a lot with executive dysfunction when it comes to things like cooking and cleaning and lack of bodily awareness with hunger cues.\n\nSo I recently researched the IE book and have read it once and now I\'m rereading it. The thing is, I\'ve realised what I never respond to hunger cues because I don\'t notice I\'m having them. I set alarms to remember to have my 3 meals and 3 snacks and then mechanically eat and don\'t think about food until my next alarm. This is usually fine but it means I can\'t be spontaneous because once I have a "system" of doing anything in place, I hate change, like if my gf suddenly decides we are going put to eat 2 hours before or after my dinner alarm or even that we\'re taking a different route than usual to the mall or something. Thing is any system has this drawback of me being stuck in it over time.\n\nSo for the last few days, I just put a bunch of food near my work station so I wouldn\'t forget and didn\'t set any alarms. And just ate when I noticed I felt lower energy. But I noticed instead of eating large meals every 5 hours or so with snacks, I haven\'t been eating any meals and have just enacted every 2 hours during the day and felt like my energy levels were more stable than ever\n\nBasically, I\'d have an apple with peanut butter, then in 2 hours a slice of toast with hummus, then in 2 hours a snickers bar, then in 2 hours raw broccoli dipped in ranch, and so on. I noticed this was easier than prepping meals which often feels overwhelming and I just ate what I had laying around and sounded good\n\nIs this a good approach?

I eat so much less candy and cheese, just because I don’t feel like it (which if you know me is something no one will believe) i eat what i want, when i want and how I want. But I never thought this meant I would eat more vegetables, more fruit and almost no cheese.

I recently discovered this sub so I\'m a new member. For a little context, I discovered IE at the end of 2020 and have been working with my IE/HAES nutritionist for over a year. I actually had an appointment with her today. I have moved on to having appointments every 3-4 months instead of every 3-4 weeks, so today we were discussing what\'s happened since my last appointment (there\'s been quite a bit, including a medical diagnosis) and how things have been going.\n\nOne thing we discussed is how to manage the desire for wanting to lose weight. She reassured me that\'s perfectly normal, everyone goes through that from time to time (even those who have been practicing IE for years), and to handle it from a non-judgmental place. She said a lot of times that desire comes from a place of wanting to belong, wanting to connect, wanting to feel worthy, and one other but now I can\'t remember what it was. She asked me what was going on around the time I last had that desire, and I speculated it was around the time a few of my friends were discussing their current diets. It was then that I realized that I don\'t know anyone else who practices IE. I do have food-neutral friends, but it\'s not the same as having a community that knows what I\'ve been through with diet culture and body image issues, and who are now practicing IE. She recommended that at this point in my journey, it\'s a good time to "find my people." \n\nShe gave me a few local resources, but I\'m curious to know if anyone in this sub is in my area and if there are any IE groups/meetups that someone could recommend. I did look through the sub and didn\'t see any links or information about groups, so if this is not allowed and there is a point of reference for local IE groups, please let me know! Anyway, I\'m in Kitsap County, WA, so I can get to Seattle and/or Tacoma easily. It doesn\'t have to be a support group, but just people who get together who are like-minded when it comes to everything IE. It wouldn\'t have to be a group that discusses IE all the time either, but meeting people who are in the same place as me to build friendships I think would be nice.

I have plantar fasciitis and haven’t been walking as much for the past few months and fell out of doing any regular movement. In the past I have really enjoyed jogging, walking, and yoga. Right now, my foot hurts when I jog or walk a lot and my stamina has gone way down after a few months with little movement, which makes everything just feel uncomfortable for my body. I can’t do a lot of what I used to enjoy with yoga right now and I can go out for short walks but I don’t find any joy in them when I’m uncomfortable after 5 minutes.

I'm getting into a bit of a ramble here. My point is that I'm not finding the type of movement required of me to be fulfilling or something I am motivated to do.\n\nI know there are ways to think about exercise outside of motivation (which seems to be what I am lacking most) like habit building in the same way we may not feel like brushing our teeth everyday but we've built the habit. Even that is hard for me to grasp. I need flexibility. I lack motivation even though I know it's extremely important for me to rebuild strength in my leg to avoid further injuries, especially if i want to return to my sport.

It took over my physical and mental health. I used to fast for days (Literally didn't have a single calorie for 72 hours) and then binge as soon as I could eat. It was hell. I was 65 kilos when I started which is lighter than I am and still thought I was too fat. Ugh.

Armed with this knowledge I challenge you to create a list of feedback you've gathered from an array of foods you've eaten across time. You'll be pleasantly surprised what you'll notice. \n\nI'm willing to bet you'll find some foods despite tasting nice don't satisfy as much as you’d prefer so they lose a portion of their charm. You'll also find things you were eating regularly actually you didn't really like all that much or foods you thought you really liked but realised actually this doesn't actually feel good after it's ingested. How good is it then really? Or perhaps you just pick your battles and make peace with it (that’s a thing too). You'll discover the foods that completely hit the spot for you without any negative blow back. Your preferred portion sizes for particular foods, your preferred temperature of different things, combination of foods, timing of different meals/foods, preferred textures etc. \n\nBy discovering this vital information about your preferences by virtue you become your own encyclopedia. Your more dialed in. I'll give you 3 examples:\n\nI like steak however I discovered it doesn't have the meatiness taste I prefer so it's somewhat of a disappointment after eating it. For this reason I don't eat it as often and go I with other beef options that satisfy me more. \n\nI like protein that I can bite/tear into. They provide me with more satisfaction than say ground beef for example. I don't feel like I've satisfied that need to bite down and chew so because of this ground beef isn't a staple food because it just doesn't hit the spot. Chicken thighs however? Ticks my boxes so I'm more satisfied with 3 chicken thighs vs any sized bowl of pasta and ground beef. \n\nAnother example is I like chocolate however I prefer chocolatey things as opposed to just chocolate most of the time. I don't find chocolate on its own satisfying enough. For that reason I'll opt for a chocolate based whatever instead to get the best of both worlds. Even within this caveat I have further preferences. When it comes to sweet foods I like cookies however I don't necessarily want to eat an entire sleeve of it. In order to be satisfied from them that's what is required (personally). Knowing this the cookies aren't as appealing, I can find something else that doesn't require that much volume to reach satisfaction. \n\nI have examples for days. The point I'm getting at here is over the course of time and eating whatever I've desired I've just come to realise what I would prefer to eat. It doesn't mean I don't like anything that isn’t my preference or won't eat them, but knowing what works best for my personal desires I always have the necessary information to best satisfy myself at any given moment.

Just wanted to share a positive post on here about where intuitive eating has brought me! For years I struggled with restriction and then BED, and just went into recovery last year. My docs have had a history of being so fatphobic towards me, putting me on diets, refusing to get past my BMI, etc. So needless to say I was a little terrified when my doc ordered me some blood tests this year (lipid panels, hemoglobin, metabolic test, etc). I instantly feared that something would be wrong because I’ve gained weight since my last blood panel, and my docs haven’t been super supportive of my intuitive eating—I was afraid I’d prove them right and give me another reason to judge my health because of my weight. \n\nHowever, I’m proud to say my tests all came back SUPER normal and healthy, the best I’ve ever tested in my life (including when I was a child!). Intuitive eating has made me feel like I’m the healthiest I’ve ever been and now I even have medical data to support it. It was a small win but it made my day. \n\nI know it’s a process and body acceptance, intuitive eating, recovery, etc all take time but if you’re in the middle of it right now, I just want to say keep pushing on. It’s worth it. And do not EVER let anyone, even a medical professional, convince you that your weight is the be-all-end-all of health. You are more than a number and how you *feel* is so much more important than anyone’s bias. Be well out there, everyone :)'}, {'Recovery': "Signs of intuitive eating???

What should I eat when this happens and how do I make it happen less?\n\nI start feeling hungry for lunch. I open up the fridge, but nothing appeals to me. I look in the freezer, the pantry, the cupboard - nothing appeals to me. I try to think about what sounds good: is there a particular taste, temperature, or texture that I'm craving? But everything sounds basically just awful. I drink some water, in case I'm thirsty, since I know this can make food seem unappealing; that doesn't work either. My stomach starts to growl. I get frustrated and angry and I just want to put something in my stomach to fill it, but I can't find ANYTHING that I actually want to eat. This happens almost daily. Almost exclusively with lunch, sometimes breakfast.\n\nI know that part of it is that I am exhausted (I'm a SAHM, with two boys, 5 and 2), and that actually making food is just beyond my capability at the moment, but even premade food or snacks just don't seem remotely appealing. So I know it's not just a lack of energy to prepare something to eat.\n\nDoes this happen to you? What do you do? Does anyone have any idea WHY this happens?

She also restricts like CRAZY to maintain this, like her breakfasts will be a cup of tea or milk. I’ve generally liked Z, but yesterday I really had to rethink my preferences. We hosted a family dinner. Z, as usual ate the least calorically heavy option. A cousin of mine was talking about how she was craving a certain dessert all week and she was so excited to have it today. Z proceeds to turn around and start her essay about how that dessert has “the MOST calories”. Then when said dessert arrives, Z removes it from in front of my cousin (I found this out after the dinner was over, I honestly would have spoken up if I was there). I just keep thinking about this and it pisses me off so much.

It's something I love about myself.\n\nIn order to persist at dieting, I had to force myself to close up. I had to shut out temptations to eat food. And now that I'm doing IE, I find myself doing the same thing. I'm shutting out the temptation to diet, because I'm worried I won't be able to recover and survive otherwise.\n\nIt's very hard for me to do this. It goes against the grain of my nature. And I worry it's making me more dysfunctional and less creative.\n\nI suspect that if I opened up, like I want, then I'd probably go on diets all the time--but they would probably last like an hour, and then I'd cave in and eat a donut or something lol. As long as I'm being truly open, I'm not gonna persist at anything that feels horrible. As soon as a strong desire to eat food comes along, I'm jumping on it.\n\nBut will that still sabotage my recovery too much? Do I need to make my recovery match my personality, or do I need to impose this rigid closedness on myself until I'm done packing muscle on?\n\nI have to admit, I'm not the best at taking advice. I only listen if someone says something that resonates with my heart.

It’s gotten to the point where it’s just kind of part of my life and I don’t have to think about it much at all. When I started IE, I gradually gained a pretty significant amount of weight over the course of a year (~50 pounds). Right around the 1 year mark though, things seemed to stabilize and I was wearing the same pants size etc for about 6 months. I began to notice I was gaining weight again around April of this year though after almost a year at that stable point. I noticed some new stretch marks on my thighs, but I had been really stressed and I didn’t think much of it. However, it’s now July and I have only continued to gain weight. I seem to get a new cluster of stretch marks on my thighs every week. I now have stretch marks on my lower belly which I never had before. My clothes from just 6 months ago no longer fit me. I don’t weigh myself so I have no idea how much weight I’ve actually gained, but I’ve definitely gained a noticeably significant amount.\n\nThe thing is, nothing has changed. I’m not particularly active but I never have been. My eating hasn’t drastically changed. I haven’t been binge eating or restricting. I’m on no new medications. And yet my weight has seemingly skyrocketed for no reason. This feels so out of alignment with everything I know about IE and I’ve been feeling so ashamed, like somehow I’m doing IE wrong. I can’t help but worry this is a sign something is wrong medically, so I finally decided to make an appointment with my PCP for this week just to get some blood work done and discuss possibilities. \n\nI feel so conflicted about the whole thing though: I’ve spent so much time trying to rewire my brain from thinking weight = health, and yet here I am gaining weight and worrying it means something is wrong with my health. It’s brought up a lot of old icky thoughts, and I’ve been contemplating restricting again more than I ever have since starting IE. \n\nAnd I’m of course so worried about how this conversation is going to go with my doctor. He’s been very weight neutral so far but I’m worried he might not get where I’m coming from completely. My plan is to go in and tell him I am  recovered from an eating disorder and have a very healthy relationship now with my body and weight. However, I have noticed unexplained weight gain that I am worried about i’m hoping he can help me rule out anything medical causing this without suggesting I go on a diet.\n\nI’m posting to see if anyone has experienced this before and has any advice on or encouragement for navigating all of these conflicting thoughts and feelings I’ve been experiencing, or if anyone has any advice on how I can handle this conversation with my doctor.

TLDR: my body size has unintentionally changed (no medical threat/problem), and I’m happier with it. I don’t want to rob myself of any kind of body satisfaction, in a culture that profits so strongly from body dysphoria, but how can I remain detached from my body’s appearance?\n\n\nFull post:\nMy body has not been a stable size in my adult life: it was smaller when I hated myself and restricted food, and it’s been larger when I haven’t done that. It’s also changed in ways that have seemed really normal in the context of my life— it has changed most when I have big shifts in routine or resources available to me. I’ve been ok with these changes. I do not think about what I eat, mostly, and I don’t live with strict guidelines around movement or intake. \n\nI’m an anti-diet clinician— like, I’ve spent years (since 2017, when I read IE and then The Fuck It Diet, and discovered Christy Harrison’s work) fostering body neutrality in my personal life, but also body acceptance and inclusivity as a value, in my professional life. I’m not unfamiliar with these concepts, and I’ve worked with so many people in healthcare as they navigate their own relationships with their bodies. It feels different, and more difficult than I would have anticipated, to navigate that now. \n\nBut my body has recently changed and is now smaller— and some things are logistically easier (all the things associated with smaller-body privilege), but after years of remaining intentionally neutral about my body’s appearance, I’m struggling with how to temper the happiness I feel about my body now fitting a “more acceptable” profile. I feel prettier, because I live in a society that says I’m prettier now, but I know that’s part of a massive cultural lie, and then I feel bad for feeling prettier.\n\nI know I’m not any better now than I have been at any other size— and my body will change again in my life, I’m sure.

Let me start by saying I have ADHD. I was diagnosed last year in my 30\'s. One of the struggles I\'ve since learned seems to be common for many ADHDers is low body awareness.  \n\n\nFor me, there\'s only two modes: I either don\'t need to pee or I need a bathroom right now because I\'m about to leak. I either don\'t need to sleep or I\'m falling asleep where I am. I\'m either not hungry or very hungry I need to eat now (within 30-45 minutes before my brain flips into hangry mode or depressed mode). It\'s like the switches in my brain for needs are either on or off, I can rarely feel an in-between (like "huh, I\'m sleepy, maybe I\'ll go to bed before I fall asleep here in the couch")... no it\'s usually "oh I fell asleep in the couch" or "I\'m falling asleep on my chair, time to go to bed").  \n\n\nHow is this a problem? Well, because amid not being able to focus, or even when I finally DO focus I can forget to eat (or drink, or sleep or literally anything else, the world is dead to me) but when I\'m done or when I finally need to stop because I \\*really\\* need to pee then everything hits me at once: I am tired and am hungry and I need food now... so I eat my portion but after I\'m done, between a 20 minutes-1 hour I still feel hungry ("I need to eat now" hungry). If it\'s been long enough and there\'s opportunity can easily eat breakfast lunch and dinner in one sitting I don\'t like it but I can also just as easily spend the day eating those small portions because I\'m not sated. I\'ve basically been hungry but eating all day.  \n\n\nWhat I\'ve been doing ( because it helps me keep my energy and focus up) is setting regular meal times. It helps me to have an alarm at morning noon and evening to cook and then I\'m eating on time and not forgetting to eat (and also I don\'t overeat... much); but this isn\'t really intuitive. I\'ve been trying to see how I feel at these times, but most of the time I either feel like I\'m super hungry (even though I ate on time—I\'ve definitely noticed I\'m a stress-eater) or that I\'m not full nor hungry but something I can describe as "I could eat" and then I eat because I don\'t want to wait until I\'m actually hungry then spend the day feeling hungry even though I\'m eating.  \n\n\nOn top of that I rarely feel full. I usually feel full when I\'ve forgotten to eat on time so I ate later than expected or when I\'ve over-eated too much too quickly.  \n\n\nSo far I feel doing this periodic eating stuff has worked best for me (it ensures I\'m not feeling like I\'m starving most of the time and helps with my ADHD) but it\'s definitely not without flaws and not intuitive. The real "cue" is the time. Why is it a problem? Because on occasions when I can\'t control my meal times (like if we\'re going out or someone is serving dinner and it\'s later than usual; or when I have to drive to appointments and I have to fend with snacks—which are better than nothing but still don\'t help as much as a meal) it can throw me off into disordered eating for days.  \n\n\nHas anyone struggled with the same?

I am above my pre-ed weight, granted that was when I was 16 so I\'m not sure if that even counts as an approximate set weight for an adult. How do you gauge your own set weight?\n\nMy issue is that I still have such a big appetite it doesn\'t make sense to me. I eat a lot, but rarely feel like I\'ve overeaten after a meal or at the end of the day but I\'m still getting bigger. Is that normal? I go to the gym 4 days a week for weightlifting, so that explains some of the appetite. But I frequently feel unsatisfied or not full after eating. I\'ve tried doing more protein, more carbs, more fiber, and I\'m still working that out to see what makes me full. Is it normal to still have a hefty appetite this far in?\n\nI keep eating around "shoulds." I "should" eat this. I "shouldn\'t" eat that. Always thoughts about when I should and shouldn\'t eat. I feel like there\'s still some weird sense of the food not being there later for me to eat. I eat when I\'m not hungry because I planned on it or feel like I should because of X or Y thing. I feel like my meals should be of a certain size and at a certain time. Not eating scares me. I feel like I always have to eat before I hang out with someone because I\'m scared I\'ll get hungry later and not be able to eat. It\'s almost compulsive. Not sure what to do about this. I feel like I\'m having trouble listening to my body instead of the other way around. \n\nSorry if this is confusing and long and thank you for any advice'}, {'Disordered': 'Help with avoiding scales when I have no choice about them being in the house  So I’m currently living with my parents whilst I’m in between moving.

It is so hard to practice self-care and resting too - feel sooo lazy, but I know I can't compromise with excefcise like I always used to. I jusr don't understand how I can eat sooo much, nap and then wake up hungry again! Thank god for Disney Plus! I was standing in the kitchen eating through the entirety of Moana haha.\n I also feel like I shouldn't even be experiencing EH, as I've only been battling with my anorexia for about 18 months, and I know so many have been fighting it for such a large part of their lives :-( I'm sorry if you have.\n My question really is, is anybody else experiencing/pr has experienced any of these things?\nWhoops I'm so sorry, this wasn't meant to be such a long rant! :-P Could talk about it for hours haha, learning so much each day.\nI hope you are all doing OK <3 I am so proud of you all on your own recovery journeys.

That said, they are all very fit athletes and actually all doctors and still it’s a little high despite making those changes. Mines way higher than theirs lol.

Stomach issues gone, and literally ate no more dairy. Cholesterol improved even more \n\nWhile pregnant I was literally unable to eat anything except rice Chex cereal with milk and fast food, and combined with a traumatic birth, my cholesterol Sky-rocketed to 230 with low HDL and high LDL. I stopped eating dairy again to cope with postpartum GI issues. \n\nHowever 6 months postpartum I finally found a doctor who treated my GI issues successfully. I FINALLY was able to eat dairy without significant side effects. In 4 months, my total cholesterol and LDL jumped 20 points. \n\nNow I am sitting crying because after a DECADE of never eating a bite of cheese or pizza or ice cream, I’ve been thoroughly enjoying them freely for the past 4 months.

Oh it’s a good fat, I feel really satiated and full when I eat it, this is a great choice!\n\nAnd yet I’m not free.

I have a 19 month old, I work from home while my own mom looks after my little one and I am a pretty active volunteer in my community. I also try to run/ workout 5-6 days a week- it’s my only “me” time. It’s constant go, both physically and mentally. \n\nSuffice to say, while I love my life and all my responsibilities (I have an amazing kid, my job is super cool, and I am happy to help my community), I am stressed. I also feel exhausted and without much “fun” in my life. Additionally, most of these responsibilities aren’t going anywhere, so there’s that. \n\nAnd I feel like I have been leaning on food to make me feel better. I am subconsciously eating. I am leaning on sugar. I am always prowling the fridge. My portions keep expanding. I’m not waiting for physical hunger. \n\nI’ve been trying to ride it out and not feel guilty about it. I have a lot on my plate (in more ways than one) but I am struggling to be compassionate to myself. And I am losing my hunger cues. \n\nAny advice for a mom trying her best? Mantras, tips, and tricks appreciated.'}, {'Recovery': 'Why is giving up the scale so hard for me?  I have been dabbling in IE for over a month now and have even started to do intuitive movement and exercising that makes me feel good but the one thing I can’t seem to move on from is the scale. I feel amazing when I’m intuitively eating because I don’t feel that stress around food like I used to (I still have my moments, but when I really commit to doing IE I feel great) and going for walks has made me feel so good about myself. Every time I start to feel good about myself, I get the urge to weigh myself to see if it’s “reflected” on the scale & when it’s a number I didn’t expect to see or it’s a lot higher than I thought it would be, I immediately feel down on myself & want to give up, even though I just felt so good about myself right before I stepped on the scale. \n\nI know the simple solution is to just get rid of it but I actually want to be content with not knowing my weight & focusing on how I feel instead of what the scale says, not just throwing it away so that it’s out of sight, out of mind. \n\nAny suggestions on how I can start to work on letting go of always knowing what I weigh?'}, {'Recovery': "Drinking soda with every meal - can't habituate to it.  I am doing intuitive eating and I do believe it works. I eat when im hungry and stop when I'm full. I see myself habituate to foods very easily EXCEPT soda. Soda is a strange food (well...drink) to me because I get the urge to drink it with every meal except breakfast (I do 4 meals a day). To be honest, I don't want to drink soda for every meal - for many different reasons that I won't list here. I did recently give myself full permission to drink soda with every meal. It's been a month but I haven't habituated to it.\n\n1. Soda makes me habituate to candy and ice cream. I ate ice cream yesterday and it tasted terrible because of my soda habit!! I want to enjoy ice cream on a nice summer day!\n2. I'm kindof a weird/picky eater because sometimes I just don't want to eat a meal because it might not taste good. But if I eat it with soda, I KNOW it'll taste better. Basically, soda makes meals taste better so I feel like I have to have it because I want to have the **best tasting meal**. Yesterday, I bought a chicken shawarma sandwich from a take out place and I felt like I HAD to have soda for it to taste good.\n3. I feel like I have a soda addiction. My brain gets mad when I try to suggest, hey maybe you can skip the soda with chipotle today.\n4. I really think its the sugar spike that I'm addicted to. Soda has so much sugar that my brain loves it.\n5. When you combine soda with meals - the combo makes for a very satisfying meal. One theory I have is maybe since every combo is different, I don't habituate. Soda + Pizza is different than Soda + Chipotle...so I never habituate since I am eating a different combo each time.\n6. After a month, it feels like it has become a habit to always drink soda with meals. I eat a lot of take out so every time I buy something, I just automatically grab soda.\n7. I don't even know if I like the TASTE of soda. I always drink it with a meal so I don't even notice the taste individually. What I like is the sugar rush. Whatever it does to my brain.\n8. Soda also allows me to eat more. Like if I see a cheesy pizza slice...it looks heavy to me. I feel like I need the soda to digest it. Maybe I think soda breaks down the heavy meal for me so it doesn't feel heavy? This one was just me free writing.\n\nWhat should I do? Let me know if you have any advice.

She tried to make a joke of it, saying she'd do it in kg and she wouldn't tell me. I told her that unless she was required to get my weight for my care for some reason, she didn't need my weight.

They\'re also competitive bodybuilders and respected in online bro spaces so I figure this would be an interesting way to look at the science outside of an IE/HAES/Anti-Diet framework. Part of doing this too was to also help me determine if some doubts I have about this framework were legitimate as if you choose to live by this framework, there is a barrage of oppositional information thrown your way. It\'s constant, as well as also being the default consensus online and in real life. It\'s hard to not have doubts and gaslight yourself. \n\nI mainly just want to list the most important points I found that really stood out to me.\n\n- Metabolic Adaption is very real, powerful, and multifaceted(occurs right down to the mitochondrial level).\n\n- Your Total Daily expenditure will drop at a larger percentage than amount of weight lost. A 10% reduction in weight can cause up to a 20-25% reduction in TDEE. I hear so many people claim metabolism only drops due to the drop in weight, that\'s empirically untrue. The fact it can drop double the percentage of weight lost is significant.\n\n- Hunger hormones are most strongly affected by metabolic adaptation, you will get much hungrier and feel less satiation over time.\n\n- Individual metabolisms vary. Some metabolisms resist change and will adjust itself up or down to fight weight changes. Others welcome weight gain, fight weight loss, some welcome weight loss. It\'s basically all individual and some people will have to work harder to gain or lose than others.\n\n- A part of your TDEE that\'s often overlooked is Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis. This is Non-Exercise movement that is related to lifestyle or unconscious movement. This is mainly responsible for the adaptation in metabolism. NEAT can vary wildly between individuals of the same size, as high as a 2000 calorie difference! These can be people in very active jobs but genetics also play a part, some people just unconsciously move more, they fidget, pace and just have a high need for movement and just naturally burn a lot of energy through the day. So during an energy deficit your NEAT plummets, the unconscious movements slow down and your desire to move drops altogether.\n\n- After being in an energy deficit for a long period of time, your body is primed to regain fat, and it will do it fast and most likely overshoot the amount of fat you started with. One study has shown when someone attempted the same diet the 2nd time after an initial failure, they lost weight at half the speed of the first attempt and regained 4x as fast, highlighting the dangers of yo-yo dieting on body composition and hormones.\n\n- In an energy deficit sex hormones are very affected, men lose testosterone and women lose estrogen. Men may begin to suffer erectile dysfunction. Women may lose their period.\n\n- Your body starts to consume lean tissue in an energy deficit and increases cortisol which also breaks down lean tissue. So dieting eats away at your important lean tissue, and the increase in hunger is an attempt to restore that lean tissue. It will always restore fat at a faster rate than lean tissue though! You will likely end up at a higher body fat percentage coming out of an energy deficit, yo-yo dieting further compounds this. Studies show long term dieters will most likely show an increase in weight over time.\n\n- They acknowledged the extremely high failure rates of diets, their success number is a little higher than the framework at 10-20% but that is still a very low success rate when risking a regain, overshoot, loss lean of tissue, changes in hormones, etc.\n\n- Recovery from an extended energy deficit takes a long time. Lean and fat tissue can happen quickly but hormones can lag behind by a lot. Testosterone can take up to 6 months. Some women though have had to wait more than a year for their period to return after a body building competition.\n\nThe Venn Diagram between the two may basically be a circle. The differences I found were in certain definitions such as "metabolic damage"(it can almost always bounce back, even with long term anorexia patients). They also don\'t believe that the metabolism can be restricted so much and for so long you can start to gain on say 1000 cals. I can\'t confirm or deny, but I\'d prefer to believe people about their experiences (the people who are vehemently opposed to this framework really make it seem like literally everyone is lying about their daily intake).\n\nUpdate: \n\nA study was done on women who claimed they couldn\'t lose weight on low calories (<1500). These women were put on a controlled 1500 calorie diet and half started to gain weight. So showing some did miscalculate, but the other half did not lose any weight and one woman started to gain! So there is some evidence it is possible to metabolically adapt so much even a low calorie diet can cause weight gain.\n\nThey also couldn\'t really offer much to offset metabolic adaptation or the high failure rates of diets despite being very evidence based(smaller deficit, higher protein, refeeds, etc). Also I found many seasoned evidence based bodybuilders switch to IE after a few years and after dealing with disordered or binge eating specifically Eric Helms and Jeff Nippard who do IE and praise aspects of it though Helms feels cautious recommending it for everyone. \n\nOverall I feel this really silenced the doubts I had and that I am on a path that is healthy and makes sense. Also proves that IE/Anti-Diet/HAES is evidence based and a lot of the same studies and conclusions are shared in sports nutrition science.'}, {'Recovery': "Weight-neutral workout channel recommendations?

I thought I would write down my journey/thoughts for those of you who are just starting or are interested. I have read the IE book about 3 times now. I have found Colleen Christensen\'s blog posts to be very helpful. Also, I had an Intuitive Eating online coach from about month 2 to month 8, and we met every 2-4 weeks during that time - she was incredible.\n\nFor the first few months, I gave myself full permission to eat as my main priority. This may look different for different people, but for me it meant eating anything and everything that I wanted and that I had previously restricted. This actually lead me to eat past fullness for most of that time. After a few months of this, I revisited the IE principles, and was able to start bringing the other things into play, like mindfulness when eating, and hunger and fullness cues. I have learned through this process that IE looks different for every person and there is no right or wrong way to implement it.\n\nAfter about 6 months, I really started settling in with the principles and started to trust myself and my body to take me further. I had a history of significant emotional eating and this was finally starting to settle down at this point.\n\nAfter about 9 months, balanced nutrition started to naturally come into play and I began gravitating towards foods with more staying power and that made my stomach and body feel good. My cravings for less nutrient dense foods decreased, but I continued to allow myself full permission to eat all foods, whenever I craved them (and still do).\n\nNow at about the 1 year mark, I am starting to get more interested in moving my body and incorporating joyful movement. It feels like a natural inclination that my body has developed. I have mostly taken this past year off of exercise. For me, exercise was the most toxic part of my relationship with my body as I used it exclusively for punishment or to change my body for many many years. I finally feel like I want to get stronger and figure out what my body is capable of! Movement is finally coming from a place of self-care, as I find it really helps my depression and anxiety.\n\nIntuitive Eating is life-changing. I have fully embraced all of the principles, but at different times when they fit best for me, and not in order necessarily. I have to continually remind myself to trust my body. I have to remind myself that there is no such thing as "perfect". I have easier days and more difficult days.\n\nI am so grateful that I have found IE.

Normally not an issue because I rarely get hungry in that window before bedtime anyway, but this week I've had several days where my regular schedule was off and I'm not sure how to handle it.\n\nI had to fast a few days these past couple of weeks because of some medical tests that I am having done.

I get into bed and I start feeling hungry, but I'm also so tired I just fall asleep.  No reflux issues, everything is fine, but am worried about ignoring a hunger cue.\n\nThe day of my next appointment, it's not a fasting appointment, but the morning appointment leads into testing that extends past lunch into the late afternoon and I miss lunch.  I am very hungry when I get back, again eat a late lunch.  This time I still wasn't hungry at dinner time, but started to get a little hungry an hour before bed and thought I might as well eat a small snack-dinner, how bad could it be.Turns out pretty bad. I haven't done that in a long time and now I vividly remember why. Up late waiting for meds to bring relief and even then, waking up in the middle of the night with discomfort later.

Ate a filling late breakfast when I got home, wasn't interested in my usual lunch time, but now it's late afternoon and I am hungry now and would like to eat.  This will probably mean I won't be hungry until after my usual dinner time.\n\nI'm not sure how to handle now - even that small amount of food for my late dinner had me miserable with reflux, but I am absolutely not hungry before then.  What is the best way to approach this scenario in the future (hopefully I just have one more round of tests in a few weeks)  - smaller late lunch even if I am hungrier at that time so that I can have a normal dinner at a normal time?

That said, I am really struggling to accept my body as it is now. The societal messages about weight are impossible to override.

Sure, I'd like to be a bit stronger, my skin is dry, all that stuff - but my body feels perfectly fine now. I actually look in the mirror and smile now.

I think over restricting was really negatively affecting this.  It just feels awesome to fuel my body to do a cool thing I want it to be able to do.  I\'m training to run a 10K and I had been stalling before and things are getting better now. \n\n* I\'m cooking for my partner, which I never did before - I did calorie counting for a loooong time and when I started dating my partner, we mostly cooked and ate our own food separately (or sitting together, but he would have something and I\'d have something else), largely because I only cooked weird bad food that fit into my calories (egg white omelet with turkey, YUM).  I\'m discovering cooking without thinking about calories, which is wonderful by it self, but it\'s especially wonderful to be able to make something for my partner because it\'s kind of something I thought I would never do.  When I was younger I was vegetarian and men I dated stuck their nose up at the idea of eating vegetarian food, so it hasn\'t been a part of any relationship for me. It\'s just really cool to be able to express love for someone in this way, when I\'ve never really done it before.\n\n* I eat less candy - I used to binge candy like crazy, and I\'m genuinely not that interested in it anymore.  My partner loves candy so we always have a lot in the apartment.  I\'ll have a few m&ms here and there but way less than I used to.\n\n* I\'m discovering what I really like, and what I tolerated - I used to eat a ton of turkey and I just have 0 interest in it now, so I don\'t eat it at all. But there are "healthy" foods that I liked before, that I like SO much more now.  Mainly smoothies, which I\'ve always liked but I used to have to measure out all my fruit and make more boring smoothies to avoid measuring 10 different things.  And now I make awesome smoothies with all the fruits and veggies I have and I just love them. Same with avocado toast and salmon - something I used to have to measure, and never felt like it was enough, and I just made avocado toast with a whole avocado and it kicks ass.  \n\nI still am having some struggles, like working on figuring out what to eat sometimes and being too scared to weigh myself, but overall this has been such a positive thing and SO much better for my mental health, it\'s just life changing and I\'m so happy I\'m doing this.\n\nWish all of y\'all all the best!'}, {'Recovery': 'Advice on hunger  Hello,\n\nI have been practicing intuitive eating for about a year now.

I’m frustrated because I feel like it’s a lie. You either care most about being skinnier, and then deal with feeling uncomfortably hungry during the day until you just don’t feel anymore or don’t register the hunger anymore; or you care most about not depriving your body and not ignoring your hunger signals, and so you eat when you’re hungry, but then never lose weight or only lose a tiny bit and never get to a goal size. \n\nI don’t want someone to pretend to straddle the line. You can’t have both. You can either want to be skinny above all else or not want to be hungry constantly above all else. Maybe some people can have both, I guess.

TW: brief mention of weight loss/ CICO/ binge eating\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter embarking on a weight loss journey in late 2018, I ultimately hired an online trainer, that I followed for a while on Instagram, in June of 2019. I was so proud of myself for doing so. I felt like I had a renewed look on life and my journey, and it felt like such a good decision. Unfortunately, this trainer encouraged very unhealthy habits. She pushed me too hard in the gym; she claimed she preached intuitive eating, but really just wanted you to meet your daily calorie goal; she made me feel like something was wrong with me for continuing to binge on the weekends due to heavy restriction during the week. Every Monday when I had to check in with her, I\'d torture myself trying to get to the source of my bingeing, not knowing that it was the practices she had me partaking in that were the root cause. She taught me that a day where you don\'t do your planned work out and don\'t meet your food goal is a failure of a day. It took me so long to unlearn these things.\n\nI try not to blame her personally for the place I was in with my body by the summer of 2020, but sometimes it\'s hard not to. She made me really loathe trainers who give nutrition advice, which is a practice I now see as so irresponsible. It\'s kind of like a "don\'t hate the player, hate the game" type of situation, but I definitely feel a lot of residual negative emotions towards the time I spent with her.\n\nI answered her message. I told her I was good and I asked her about herself. I thought about the other things I could say to her, as I\'ve thought before about what I might say if given the chance, but I\'m not really sure I\'m interested. I\'m happy to tell her I\'m in a place now where a trainer is unnecessary, that my goals are purely based on making myself feel good and happy. But wow, this really surprised me today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: The conversation inevitably came to my "health and fitness journey." I responded with the following:\n\nI feel I would be remiss in not letting you know that my time spent with *\\[program name\\]* was a really low time in my life. The practices you encouraged (restricting calories, marking down days on a calendar as “good” or “bad” based on whether or not I worked out or hit my calorie goal, weighing myself every day, pushing me past a comfortable limit in the gym) were detrimental to my mental and physical health. I was depressed, I was anxious, I turned down social plans and pushed people away. I didn’t know how to participate in your program and also live as a happy, healthy human being. I love food. I was working at *\\[amazing food-related job\\]* at the time, and I was absolutely terrified of the food that was around me. I couldn’t enjoy simple things in life because of my commitment to your program. I loathed Monday check-ins because I would wrack my brain trying to find the reason for my binges, when in reality, following the program was the root cause. *\\[program name\\]* made me feel like a failure for falling off track. It took me a long time to recover from this and to unlearn all of these habits.\n\nIn the years since, I have embraced intuitive eating and joyful movement and I have truly never been happier. I no longer participate in movement as an attempt to change my body, and I eat to nourish myself and also simply to enjoy food.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA 2: My former trainer apologized and said this "wasn\'t the intent" of the program.

I'd say that I consider myself more or less recovered for the past 7-8 years or so.\n\nIf you would've asked me a few months ago if I still head fear foods, I would've told you no. Because my idea of a fear food was what it was when I was in the middle of my anorexia: A food I didn't dare touch with a 10 foot pole. A few months ago, this was (thankfully!) not the case anymore, it hadn't been for years.\n\nBut doing IE I found out I still had fear foods, just not in the way I expected. They were foods that I liked but that I didn't 'dare' make a regular part of my diet, even if I ate them sometimes and wasn't scared of eating them, per se. I wasn't scared of the foods themselves, but of making them part of my diet. It wasn't a concious choice and that's probably also why I didn't realise. These were just foods that were for others, not for me. Since IE, there have been several of these foods that I 'rediscovered' and that are now a regular part of my diet.\n\nSome examples are peanut butter, nutella, certain local pastry's, non-diets drink, 10% fat greek yoghurt (my go to breakfast now, with honey and nuts!), having a bun with my burger, using sugar instead of sweetener in my porridge, fudge, cereal.... Probably not even a complete list. As you can see, I had a LOT of fear foods and so many of them are now giving me nourishment and enjoyment\n\nIf there's any foods you feel shouldn't be part of your diet, please ask yourself why you feel this way, and just try them out for a while.

I had a baby 2 months ago. I’m no longer having pregnancy cravings so I think my food taste has changed.

I’m Kurdish, and I humorously describe my newfound eating habits as those of an oppressed farmer in Southeastern Turkey in the 1980s. I’m not making any plans to eat that way, it’s just how it’s turned out. My husband is the same ethnicity as me and while we usually have most of the same opinions about food, I feel like he’s nagging me to eat differently. I know he means well because I needed him to do this when I was first weight restoring, but now it feels like I don’t need that and that he’s being a food pusher. \n\nI’m a bit low on Vitamin D and newly iron deficient (I needed a transfusion when I gave birth) so I’m trying to incorporste more foods with those nutrients. He’s supportive and makes sure to get them when grocery shopping. He also gets a whole bunch of stuff that I didnt ask for, and I feel…like he’s not taking my health seriously? Even though he obviously is, he went to all my antenatal appointments and ultrasounds and was there when I gave birth and is always asking me how I’m feeling. \n\nHere are my thoughts during one of these interactions with him: “Look, *****, I never said I couldn’t pick up a McDicks. I never said anything was off-limits. But I’m dehydrated and hot chocolate isn’t gonna help. I’m milking my baby, for fork’s sake! She needs nutrition that no amount of pastries can provide. And just thinking about pizza is making my face look like a pizza..”\n\nI don’t have any intention to lose weight or even feel like I have anything to lose. That isn’t a defining feature of my disordered eating, which centres around morality, but I’m not really experiencing moralistic thoughts about food either. I don’t eat dinner and feel like a sinner. I start when I want to, I stop when I no longer want to. I’m not restricting by quantity.\n\nYet I feel another sort of food anxiety. Like it isn’t just annoying when he foists cake on me for the third time in a week, but like it’ll mess with my hormones and my skin and make me a bloated bag of water. Basically what wellness influencers fearmonger about.\n\nAlso I do sometimes use diet-like language when making food decisions with my husband. For example “that’s bad for me” or “I’m not supposed to eat that”. He doesn’t speak a huge amount of English, so I often speak in a more simplistic way with him, and this could be why.

But I was functioning in the mindset that "all nutrition is a lie and doesn\'t matter what I eat as long as I\'m eating enough of anything". \n\nI went back and reread the chapter on gentle nutrition and realized I don\'t feel well, haven\'t in a while, and need to let the pendulum swing back to the middle where I can have gentle guidelines that help me get a variety of nutrients from a variety of foods that help my body feel it\'s best. \n\nThere\'s been a lot of unlearning I had to do to get here but I think I\'m on the right path. \n\nHow did you start with gentle nutrition?'}, {'Disordered': 'IE Helping in Other Areas, Too?  \\*Trigger warning for my previous diet behaviors/mindset\\*\n\nI\'ve noticed since I started IE, especially recently (about a year in, where I am just now beginning to be much less fixated on food), that other parts of how I take care of myself and my family have changed too. A big part of my diet mentality was that I needed to cook certain foods to keep my family "healthy," and if I didn\'t, then I was a bad parent/partner/human being. I definitely lean toward perfectionistic tendencies and anxiety, and while never having been diagnosed with an ED, definitely had a lot of common characteristics of that--I need to eat to make sure the kids ate x, y, and z for "health," and avoiding a, b, c because that will have terrible effects for the kids, for example. But now that I\'ve removed the morality from food, I\'ve started to remove the morality from a lot of other things--whether I choose to work long hours vs. stay home; whether we eat pizza three days in a row because that\'s just what we all wanted 3 days in a row; whether I choose to stay up late and watch a bunch of TV instead of going to sleep early. I am a much happier person and the kids are happier and I have so much more mental energy for things that actually matter instead of limiting the amount of sugar in the snacks my kids eat, or something like that. There are probably dozens of other examples, but I feel like I finally feel like I\'m giving myself a break from trying to be "perfect" (as if that exists) at everything and it is so freeing.

I had a history of disordered eating and I can't say being gluten-free was 100 percent positive for me but overall I was able to have a generally peaceful relationship with food. About 8 years ago I moved to a new state and immediately got a new GI doctor. The doctor checked my records and said that he did not agree with the diagnosis of celiac disease based on my endoscopy. He wanted to retest me because he did not feel comfortable providing care under that diagnosis. It took me 3 years to decide to undergo the testing (I wanted to have accurate medical information for my son who was also having GI issues). The whole thing was a bit of a disaster and I ended up in pretty much the same place I started. About the same time I started learning about intuitive eating and anti-diet.   I was having a lot of GI issues and chalked it up to eating gluten for the first time in many years. I very much wanted to eat all foods and figured that if I did not have an official Celiac diagnosis that I should continue to eat gluten. I read a lot of work Marci Evans and others that show restriction and disordered eating can cause gut symptoms. I put a lot of faith into believing that if I could get past an initial phase that I would get better. This never really happened for me. I started working with a new RD who is anti-diet, pro disordered eating recovery who helped me understand the difference between restricting a food because ED is telling me to versus restricting a food because my body is telling me to.\n\n My medical papers say that I have selective IGA immunodeficiency/non-celiac gluten sensitivity. My lived body experience tells me that this is true, however, I have heard the message over and over again that diet culture is at the root of non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Being anti diet is absolutely a value of mine and I find myself doubting my experience very often .

I'm also making progress on body image and unlearning self-objectification. Now to the problems: I've had lower back pain consistently for the past month that limits everyday activities. If I am standing or walking for more than 10 minutes it starts to hurt. I feel like my quality of life has been pretty seriously impacted by rapid weight gain. (I was already in a larger body and have gone up about two sizes.) I try to stand/walk with better alignment by tilting my pelvis back, but it's difficult to do with the extra padding/water retention. I also feel like I have a lot of water retention because my body feels sort of puffy and sometimes certain body parts hurt from the puffiness. For example, if I crouch down, my legs hurt. Even my shoes are all too tight now. My flexibility is also suffering, and some very basic things are difficult to do now. I am generally quite active and have been putting more effort into weight lifting and yoga in order to feel good in my body, but these things aren't helping with the pain. I feel ready to incorporate gentle nutrition, and I'm learning which foods and amounts don't feel as good, so I hope that will help me feel better soon.

Im eating the equivalent of 5-6 meals a day.\n\nA few times I’ve eaten enough and it’s felt amazing! It’s just really time consuming eating that much, when I’m trying to care for two small children. Quite often I’m going to bed hungry.\n\nI don’t know if there’s anything else I can be doing? Or is it okay just to accept I’m doing my best and I can’t always honour my hunger?\n\nEDIT: **TW diet talk** Thanks for the replies everyone. I can’t believe I didn’t spot I was thinking ‘sugar bad, whole grain good’. When I’ve (regretfully) dieted in the past, I would find I’d have a couple of weeks of it feeling really easy, then it would all fall apart. I think I may have accidentally put myself on a ‘diet’.\nThe book only had a brief description on how to practice intuitive eating, it seemed straightforward although it said you have to completely let go of diet culture.

If you\'re able to do that successfully, hats off, keep doing that. But if you\'re like me, it\'s a hard transition to make.  When I was in full swing with my ED (which was mostly restrictive with some binging), I was ignoring hunger cues so much that they almost stopped existing. I bulldozed them into oblivion and they were all out of whack. On top of that, I still had deeply ingrained beliefs that eating less was better. Because of these two factors, my hunger cues were not reliable enough to guide IE. When I tried to transition into IE, I defaulted to not eating. That obviously caused a lot of relapses and I seesawed between IE and ED for a long time.\n\nSo instead, at the advice of a therapist, I started eating by the clock. I ate breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack, and dinner at set times regardless of how hungry I was. After a few months, my body adjusted and I started to feel hungry just before mealtime. Over time, I started to feel comfortable enough in my recovery to skip a meal if I wasn\'t hungry for it: I was confident that that was a "real" hunger/lack of hunger cue rather than a messed up ED cue. Now, about 1.5 years into recovery, I feel much more comfortable doing IE. Not that I do perfectly by any means.

Very rarely feeling full, never satisfied, thinking about food 24/7, physically hungry every hour or so. I restricted on and off (skipping meals) since January 2021, then did more extremely around July and lost my period for 6 months. During that time I kept my weight suppressed below where it wanted to be, but went all in around December. Ate a lot and then got my period back a month later. In January I started panicking and unconsciously restricting again, stuck to safe foods and ignored mental hunger. Then stopped doing this a month later, although still feared mental hunger and never fully honoured it despite eating more. I’ve had two periods since losing it, but it’s been four months now and my extreme hunger hasn’t gone away. I’m scared this might not even be extreme hunger as I have OCD and I’m worried it could be a somatic version of this. That I’m actually obsessed with food and I’m using extreme hunger as a label to justify my eating habits to myself when this is not the case. My Brain tells me I just want an excuse to be so greedy. It terrifies me that I can still eat and eat and eat and my family tell me that I’m overindulging and I’m afraid they might be right. These last few days have been so horrible and it feels easier to turn back to restricting because I hate my body and I’m scared that this hunger will never go away.

I made some jokes and didn't really explain anything. \nBut I noticed that I stopped paying attention to my fullness cues. I started ordering food more frequently(even if I didn't have a craving for it).

But it wasn’t sweet enough. So I added honey, but more intrusive thoughts came! I felt like honey was “too much sugar” but honey is virtually nothing, right? But I had to remind myself (again) that it’s okay to eat what I’m craving, regardless of how “healthy” it is. \n\nI ended up eating it, but it was really hard not to look up how much protein was in peanut butter, or if nutritionists deem it acceptable to eat more than one serving of whole wheat bread. I needed some sort of permission, and although I tried not to, I ended up telling my mom what I was going to have for dessert, which she said looked good and had no negative remark. I ended up having a talk with her about why I feel like I need permission to eat something and how it’s so hard to eat without it.

I have an intense need to stimulate myself through dopamine through food, and medication is the only thing that takes away those desires. My conditions also resulted in a very rapid, painful weight gain that is not the set point I held for most of my life.\n\nI don\'t want to feel bad for wanting to lose weight.

I started IE officially only a few weeks ago and read the book twice recently. But I have a friend who is an eating disorder dietician and had mentioned the term intuitive eating to me months ago. I knew that’s how she ate and maintained her weight, happiness and her relationship with food and her body always seemed so healthy. So I let go of dieting about 6 months ago but kinda just went HAM on food not realizing there were principles. \n\nThe book has changed everything for me. I was raised by an emotionally abusive mother who always had me on diets and compared my curvy body (5’0 with 36DDD boobs and an ass) to my sister who’s 5’8 and slimmer build. \n\nIronically I was always a healthy weight but was restricted as to what I could order or eat at all. And she fat shamed me in front of others and regularly to me. I needed a size 4 prom dress and she told me how disgusting I was becoming which was just getting my womanly figure. I now know she has body dysmorphia and was terrified I would become overweight like her. So naturally I would binge eat with friends or anytime I wasn’t around her. I would sneak food and eat it without any pleasure bc I’d get in trouble. \n\nI have struggled with fat phobia and body checking my whole life and struggled with self worth for not being a size 0 in high school and since then dreaming of being a 4 which I haven’t been since 18. \n\nI’m done trying to shrink and thinking that’s my only self worth. I’m still working on my fat phobia and probably need more therapy but I’m becoming less obsessed with food finally, learning to appreciate my curves. \n\nI’m eating the rich desserts and carbs I was never allowed to have all in a balanced portion way and my binging has stopped. I crave salad just like I crave cookies and am overall happy to not be counting and meal prepping and hating myself. It’s really hard but I’m already noticing my mood has improved, I’m enjoying my exercise routine and can focus on feeling my emotions for real instead of burying with food. \n\nI’m just proud of myself for undoing years of trauma my mom put me through and I then took on.'}, {'Recovery': "Movement Monday: Share anything related to joyful movement here!

Has minimal side effects. However, in order to fully absorb, it requires that you eat at least 300 calories with it when you take it. Also, it has an immediate drowsiness side effect, so it is better taken at night. I have tried many mood stabilizers, and really dont want to start trying them again. Latuda works without any major side effects.\n\nI relapsed in my ED in 2020, and had to take medical leave from school after a suicide attempt in October. I ended up in residential treatment for my ED in January 2021, and was released in April of the same year. I have been committed to recovery since my release, and have been behavior free ever since.

Im doing really well with it, and lately my hunger cues have seemed to fully return and its getting much easier to listen to my body as i eat. However, as I turn this corner, a new problem is arising.\n\nIm finding it difficult to fit my latuda into intuitive eating.

Bc im eating when I\'m not hungry, my ED brain kicks in, fretting over all the weight im probably gaining from having to eat this extra snack. I get tempted to restrict earlier in the day to fit it in.\n\nA possible solution is just taking it with dinner and forgoing a snack, but i don\'t like how early that would have me in bed. I could also reduce the amount i eat at dinner so that i would be hungry before bed, but that feels like letting my ED win and cheating my way out of eating intuitively.\n\nIm just not really sure what i should do and this feels like a road block in my recovery.

I\'ve read the IE book 2x. A few IE-aligned podcasts here and there, but not much.\n\nTL;DR: I feel terrible in "my" body that doesn\'t even feel like my body and I don\'t see a way out. Feel betrayed by diet culture and anti-diet culture alike. Don\'t trust myself to even make the next right move, considering how badly all of my previous body and eating related decisions have gone for me. Considering bracketing the entire issue and just giving up for now.\n\nLong version: Stopping dieting, started IE, immediately started gaining weight. Gained way more than I was comfortable with but decided to trust the process since I was so mentally beat up from dieting that had evolved into disordered eating over the years. Weight gain finally stopped around a year ago and frankly it\'s been hell ever since. The mental peace around food came, the body peace never did. \n\nThis particular emotional spiral was triggered by yet another failed attempt to shop for clothes for the new me. Wanted to try on some jeans, decided to up a size from what I normally buy just to avoid what ended up happening anyway: this is the biggest size clothing I\'ve ever been ever, and they didn\'t fit. Couldn\'t even get over my hips. I already feel so terrible. I thought I could try to spruce myself up, treat myself with some respect, and buy nice clothes to make it all better so I could at least look better than I feel. And it seems I can\'t do that either. I literally could not stop myself from crying the entire way home, still am crying a little bit. \n\nThis just prompted more and more reflection about what to do and how to move forward, and it occurred to me how trapped I feel by all of this. By diet culture, by anti-diet culture, all of it. I feel failed and betrayed by all of it, to be completely honest. I understand this may not be completely rational but it\'s the best way I can describe how I feel right now.\n\nWhen I was completely disordered I felt so much shame; I felt ugly and out of control and just so unworthy. So I left. \n\nNow I\'m in this IE space, trying to drag myself out, and yet these same feelings still plague me. I feel so much shame around how I look. I still feel ugly, and like I\'ll never find anything that can make me look even halfway decent. I don\'t even want to leave my house because I just don\'t feel confident at all. I\'ve been "adjusting" to my new body for over a year now and it hasn\'t gotten any better at all, it seems. If anything, it\'s gotten worse.\n\nNormally at this point in the past I would just run back to the next diet. Anything to alleviate this feeling. But I\'ve failed so many times and gained it back so many times that I just don\'t know that I could ever go back.\n\nThis is where I start to feel "betrayed" by IE, by anti-diet, by all of it. I specifically left diet culture to avoid feeling like this. And yet here I am. I\'m still not happy. I still feel ugly and unworthy. There\'s a whole industry of frankly conventionally attractive, straight-sized influencers (I\'m not trying to blame them for looking the way they do, btw - they deserve to feel happy in themselves and to talk about whatever they feel passionate about online as well) pushing IE that I was dumb enough to listen to, not realizing that of course it wouldn\'t work out that way for me. I may feel more "mentally normal" but it didn\'t make ME normal in the eyes of society, which kind of matters a lot considering that I live in society, I want to be and feel genuinely included in society, and I\'m single so of course I would like to find love in this society as well. Instead I feel marginalized and alone.

My self-trust is also at an all-time low (it was low when dieting, started to come back a little when I started IE, and now is plummeting again), and I don\'t have faith in my decision-making anymore.

So I decided to give intuitive eating a go after restricting my food and then experiencing extreme hunger, it’s only been a few months and I’m still very much letting go of food rules /forbidden foods.

I do still have obsessive thoughts sometimes if I’m out with people but it’s not always as overpowering. I still try and honour those thoughts when I’m out and I certainly do with actual physical hunger signals. But does the fact they aren’t always as extreme on busy days/days where food is less immediately available to me make my mental/extreme hunger less valid.

As recommended, I've been 100% honoring the cravings for the past few days. I didn't really think chocolate was still a 'problem food' for me but turns out that it maybe still was.

She's never shown interest in learning more about intuitive eating, and I don't push it on her.\n\nTonight she wanted to talk about some concerns she has. It basically boiled down to her fear that I won't want to educate our kids about (what she sees as) healthy eating, nutrition, what calories are, etc. She worries that if one day in the future one of our kids put on some additional weight that she would want to make some modifications to our family meals and movement and that I would resist modifications. This is purely hypothetical, our kids are all under five years old right now.\n\nShe was trying to be careful not to criticize what I am personally doing for my body and mental health.

Can\'t stop eating, despite no restriction on eating window, foods to eat, &etc. I WANT IE to work, and have read & consumed an enormous amount of IE content (mostly books, some podcasts, lurked in this community). I just am facing the reality right now that, after a year, things aren\'t working and that I (and my ED team) seem to be out of things to try.\n\n\\---\n\nI am looking for advice, because (even more frustratingly) I can\'t seem to find anyone in my situation.\n\nIt seems as though virtually every succeeds with intuitive eating, and it\'s recommended as a cure-all. I feel unbelievably depressed/hopeless, because somehow although it works for everyone else, I\'ve had the worst year of my life trying IE, despite always thinking a breakthrough should be around the corner.\n\nAs background: I\'ve had binge eating disorder--more compulsive, addictive eating--for over a decade. I\'ve been working with an ED counselor and an ED nutritionist, both of who specifically promote IE. A little over a year ago, I started IE, reading Elyse & Evelyn\'s book, as well as several others & some IE/HAES podcasts. I was so excited & committed fully, because it seemed to be the only thing that works for everyone.\n\nUnder the guidance of the counselor & nutritionist, who I get along with very well, I worked on "reintroducing" foods back in. This honestly was *very* easy--I essentially ate non-stop for about a week.  I ate mostly sweets/candy/fried foods, etc. I felt really sick by the end of each day, but I didn\'t judge, or try and compensate (I\'ve never been a big exerciser, and I wasn\'t exercising at all at this time). I started drinking soda (multiple cans per day) but didn\'t want to try and "cut down" or course because I didn\'t want to restrict at all. This went on for several months, and I spent a ton of money on food because I kept telling myself I didn\'t want to curtail myself (I could somewhat afford it, but it was still a lot of money). I chalked it up to self-care, and didn\'t want to put limits on because I didn\'t want there to be a "backdoor" to psychologically create rules (i.e. "no candy is too expensive, I won\'t buy it, etc.)\n\nAfter a few months, I was extremely sick to my stomach within a few hours of waking up every day. I would start eating within about an hour of waking up (I didn\'t want to go too long without eating, and was trying not to worry about whether I was hungry or not--I wasn\'t hungry at all for these months, but I really wanted food and felt like eating), and then I essentially wouldn\'t stop eating until I was so full that my stomach physically hurt. I was getting bad acid reflux, and very painful bloating. It made me not really wanting/able to walk around or do much, but again I wanted to be gentle with myself so I didn\'t beat myself up about anything, I just would relax when I felt sick.\n\nEventually, my counselor + nutritionist had me start noting my hunger level & mood when I ate. I ate almost all day every day (the only thing that stopped me was the physical fullness of my stomach) and I never got hungry because I\'d eat as soon as I could when I wasn\'t too full. I would eat regardless of whether I was sad, mad, happy, stressed, excited, &etc. I would eat whether I was at home, work, school, family event, friend\'s houses... There wasn\'t a specific "trigger" outside of eating food. Once I ate breakfast, I didn\'t stop eating or thinking about food.\n\nFast forward to now, about 1 year since I started this journey. Food absolutely controls every minute of my life. I eat whatever I want, and I haven\'t restricted food in well over a year. I eat shortly after waking up, and eat until nighttime--I haven\'t been hungry in over a year, and that\'s not an exaggeration. I feel so broken. I kept waiting for that moment when I didn\'t want candy, or fast food. When I didn\'t want to eat X, when I could "listen to my body" and not eat because I wasn\'t hungry. I feel insanelly uncomfortable because of how distended my stomach becomes from always been so tight with food. My heart rate has shot through the roof, typically tied to how many sodas I drink per day. I\'m legitimately concerned about my resting heart rate, and tend to be out of breath even when sitting let alone trying to move. My counselor & nutritionist keep giving me advice that seems to go no where--i.e. they want me to "choose another activity when I want to eat, like take a bath or call a friend," but the point is that no matter how hard I TRY to stop and do that, I become increasingly anxious and feel a strong need for food (yes, even when I\'m having a great day!)\n\nI have gotten blood work &etc. and there is nothing abnormal re: thyroid or other areas. I honest to god don\'t know what to do anymore. I\'m constantly told NOT to put any rules around my eating, because that\'ll make things worse, but honestly I\'m at absolute rock bottom--worse than before I started IE to be blunt. I don\'t want to give up, but I truly have no idea what to even do anymore. I have a life outside of food, but now food is taking over entirely. Why does it seem like I\'m alone in this experience with IE? What can I do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\nEdit: I know this is long, but I wanted to add: I\'ve spent the past few hours reading posts and I want to add something. I have absolutely dealt with, in every way I possibly can, any "emotional" sides to my eating. I am sure people would say I haven\'t dealt with underlying issues, and of course I can\'t prove anything with an internet post, but I know that for me, the fact that I think only about food, and eat until my stomach hurts daily, is the only problem in my life. I have many other great opportunities that it\'s actively getting in the way of. I do not have stress--I even quit my job about 6 months ago to really focus on my recovery & other growth projects--but I sometimes feel so sick or so caught up in eating that it\'s all I do all day. I feel like every single piece of advice I come across gives the impression that intuitive eating is a cure-all.

There were also plenty of cake and frosting scraps in the fridge for the taking. \n\nCake is a big fear food for me. I couldn\'t bring myself to actually cut a full slice for myself, but the urge to eat some was strong. So when no one was looking, I grazed on little bits of the frosting/cake scraps — sometimes a few bites, then another few bites an hour later etc etc — which only led to feelings of guilty/sneakiness and "forbidden fruit" thinking (wanting the cake even more.) \n\nToday while making dinner, I had the urge to eat some cake. I did my usual sneaky grazing, but as the guilt started to emerge, I decided to do something different. I cut myself a full slice of cake and put it on my plate next to my dinner. I took a minute to center myself/get in touch with my body and I said okay, you have full permission to eat this cake, and as much cake as you want, and all the cake scraps and frosting in the fridge too if that\'s really what you want. \n\nThe effect of putting it on a plate and giving myself permission to eat it was almost instantaneous — It immediately lost a lot of its forbidden appeal! Somehow seeing a full slice sitting there in all its glory (instead of sneakily stealing bites) made me realize "Oh, it\'s just a slice of cake! It does taste good, but I don\'t know if I want cake right at this moment. I think I\'d prefer my dinner." \n\nI did enjoy a few more bites of cake (which I really slowed down and savored) and then moved on to dinner. I kept it on my plate throughout the meal just to see if I\'d want more, but I didn\'t. I put it back in the fridge knowing that I would have some for later if I wanted it. \n\nThis also made me realize my own scarcity mindset RE: sharing the cake with others — "Other people might eat this before me, so I better get there first!" Setting aside a piece just for myself that I know I can eat anytime I want helped shift away from that. \n\nJust wanted to share this win!'}, {'Recovery': 'Advice for IE with a toddler  Hello everyone!

I don’t know how to cope.\n\nFor context: I was actually very skinny as a child/young adult—bony even—but my belly was always round. It’s my body shape I guess. I then started gaining weight over a year and a half just before the pandemic because I was in an emotionally abusive relationship in which I turned out to have been used as the outlet of a feeding fetish without my consent. Then the pandemic struck, which led to more weight gain, and I was placed on antidepressants due to being unable to cope with the fallout from the aforementioned relationship, which led to—you guessed it—more weight gain. Due to my shape, a lot of it has gone to my belly. It has taken me months to even just reappropriate my body and not have it feel completely foreign to me. I started IE around that time because my relationship with food and my body was completely messed up at this point and I knew a diet was never gonna fix any of it.

I used to get awful cramps sometimes during practice. My solution to this problem was to not eat for three hours before practice or before a race. This is the first I remember trying to control my food intake.\n\nI had a difficult freshman year of college and was pretty lonely. My first semester, at the school where I went, each meal included an entree, a bag of chips, a piece of fruit, and a soda. Since all of this was included, I always took everything and I always ate all of it. It seemed a waste not to.\n\nMy second semester, I transferred schools. I joined the running club and every day after practice, I and some of my friends from the club would eat dinner together. There was a culture of eating a ton of food after our runs, so I always stuffed my tray, even though at this school the dining halls at this new school charged by item, not by all-inclusive meal. One of the girls I ate with had a history of anorexia. Looking back, we were all disordered eaters on some level. This is pretty common in sports.\n\nI remember freshman year I didnt keep any food in my room, but when I had urges to binge, I would sometimes eat my roommate\'s food. My logic was that even if I binged, I wouldn\'t let myself eat as much of her food than if it was my own because I didnt want her to notice. Needless to say, I felt extremely guilty every time I stole her food. \n\nI continued binging throughout college, often while staying up late trying to finish an essay that I had procrastinated. I was also binge drinking which didnt help because I tended to binge eat when I got home from a night out drinking. At some point I started purging too because I was literally making myself sick and I felt disgusting. My stomach felt awful and I felt guilty and it felt like the only way to feel a little better.\n\nThese habits continued past college and into my twenties. I was becoming exercise addicted and running six or seven days a week no matter how I was feeling. I was pretty much eating all day long. I had completely lost track of my hunger cues and would be constantly looking at the clock until enough time had passed that it felt acceptable to eat again. I was still drinking, not excessively but habitually, and drinking often led to my worst binges. \n\nAll the time I was doing this I somehow didn\'t acknowledge to myself what I was doing. I knew that  I felt out of control around food and I wished that I could eat socially without being hyper focused on the food itself. I envied people who could sit in front of a bowl of chips and not continuously eat them.\n\nI realize now that the reason it took so long for me to acknowledge I had a problem was because I was surrounded by disordered eaters. Once you start IE, you realize just how many people engage in some disordered eating behaviors. It\'s just about everyone!\n\nWhen I was 24 or so I read the book "Brain over Binge" written by an author who had recoveted from bulimia. The basis of her strategy was like "just don\'t do it" which sounded appealing but didn\'t help me.\n\nIt wasn\'t until about 2 years ago that I discovered intuitive eating. All the time I was engaging in disordered eating behaviors I thought that I was gluttonous and out of control. Realizing that it was my restrictive mindset that was triggering my urges to binge was huge. I started allowing myself to eat. Knowing that I could always have the food later if I wanted it helped me get rid of my scarcity mindset. And recognizing the different types of hunger helped me realize I don\'t have to be starving to eat. In fact, it\'s better to eat before I get extremely hunger because I\'ll be more in tune with my hunger signals.\n\nNow, I can go to a social gathering where there is food and take what I want without worrying about missing out on something I didn\'t put on my plate. I enjoy my meals more because I ask myself what my mind and body want every time I go to eat. I can eat my old fear foods in moderation or turn them down altogether if I\'m not in the mood for them. I can have a drink or two and still stay in touch with my hunger cues. I can eat dinner with friends and focus on the conversation and not the food. \n\nI started my disordered eating when I was 14 and I\'m now 27. I still struggle with labeling foods as good or bad and I go a little overboard with gentle nutrition. I have trouble tuning into my hunger cues sometimes. Some of my harder to break food rules rear their ugly heads still. But I no longer feel like food is ruling my life, and I *never* binge or purge anymore and haven\'t for years. \n\nI hope those of you who are new on your journey have read this and can see that it is possible to change your relationship with food. IE is a continuous process but it works and you can do it.'}, {'Disordered': "what is the shape of progress?

There are a few types of moment I thoroughly enjoy now. I struggled to put my goal into words, but yesterday I had a series of childhood memories resurface. Usually I don't remember my childhood fondly, there was a lot of trauma from my family and a lot of bullying from other kids. But yesterday I remembered the joy I felt when I was moving my body.\n\nI remember being just so tiny and chasing pigeons on the town square for what seemed like hours as my mom sat in a cafe with a friend. I remember how bored I was with walking and just ran when I could and skipped and jump when couldn't. I climbed any rock I could scramble up on. I carefully balanced on the curb whenever someone let me. I loved the monkey bars, I loved just jumping up to grab a bar, turning upside down, hook the knees and swing back and forth, laughing maniacally. I remember badgering my mom to go swimming all summer long, then refusing to go out of water every time. Then there was this wedding anniversary of some relatives I didn't know, they rented out this big hall and I was so bored I decided to do 500 cartwheels - and the difficult part was the counting. It felt like I weight nothing at all, even though I was actually a fat kid. My muscles must have been powered by an inexhaustible reserve of rocket fuel.\n\nBut I also remember other kids laughing at me for jiggling as I ran. I also remember being the only girl who could do a pull-up - and the only kid that got called into the office after they took out those fat measuring calipers. And how I was just so alone. Shamed for how my joy of movement inconvenienced adults, then the bad stuff at home, then the bullying... I did my best to turn into a rock.  Do nothing. Think nothing. Feel nothing. Need nothing.\n\nI started breaking out of that, though. Quite recently, I started freeing my body too. I just want to go back to that. To be able to implicitly trust my body to be able to do whatever I think up, feeling invincible. Climbing stuff, doing crazy stunts. Feel good when I'm moving and moving because it feels good. I'm constantly holding back, afraid of getting hurt, injury prone as I am. My body feels heavy on me and I'm afraid of being too weird. I'm not sure if I can feel quite like that again (for one, I now understand that falling from high places isn't all that fun), but maybe I can get close. I'm still trying to figure out how, though.

I was never diagnosed but looking back that’s exactly what it was. In the last 3-4 years I would say I have almost fully recovered from it - with the help of feminist thinking/ intuitive eating/ general being nice to myself. \n\nHowever, I am realising more and more that I am nowhere near fully recovered. I try to intuitively eat now which has been going really well but recently I feel like I’ve been quite confused with knowing how my body is feeling and what it wants. To preface: I recently started doing a lot more exercise than usual (not at all for weight loss purposes but as it helps with my dissociation and depression, and also because I want my lungs to be stronger and just to feel more capable of doing the things I want to do.) So I’ve been rock climbing for six ish months which has been great, and in the last few weeks Ive started to do Muay Thai. I also walk/hike a lot because I enjoy it. As a result of this I think my body has needed a lot more food, but this still scares me somewhat. I try to eat enough (Ive pretty much doubled the amount of food I eat) but I still find myself feeling super hungry and almost wanting to binge. Sometimes I don’t want to eat more because I’m tired and want to sleep, but I feel that old feeling coming back of my body just wanting more and more. And I am fine with this but I struggle with feeling it because it reminds me of binging. I have noticed myself subconsciously restricting i.e not buying ice cream when I wanted it, making excuses to check calories, limiting the amount of bread I eat. \n\nOn top of this, my flatmate has recently started a diet in order to lose weight. I find it very restrictive as he cannot have any carbs, and he exercises every day and talks a lot about how much weight he has lost and the fact that he can’t eat carbs. Even before the diet he would talk a lot about how he ate ‘like shit’ which I didn’t like. I think it has all really triggered me. Even seeing him visually lose weight just makes me feel unsafe and uncomfortable. I was thinking of asking him not to talk about his diet/ weight around me because it is triggering, but I wonder if that could be interpreted as rude or controlling? \n\nEssentially, I am starting to feel ‘out of control’ around food and my body again and it’s making me very sad.

When he was very young and we were starting him on solids, I was verrrrrry much still in diet culture and my husband and I really aspired to have him eating a very low-sugar and no "junk" diet.  Eventually this started to backfire on us (full disclosure, he got in trouble at daycare when he was \\~3 for eating cookies another kid had dropped on the floor, that was my wakeup call that my approach was not sustainable).  Around this time I started to discover Intuitive Eating for myself and also reading more seriously about Division of Responsibility (DOR, which I would describe as an IE-compatible method of feeding kids).  I started letting more of my kid\'s pleasure foods (graham crackers, goldfish, gummies) into the house, and we also started to enjoy more baking together.  He was initially pretty obsessed, if he was aware we had a box of graham crackers, he was desperate to have them all the time. After lots of reading and some trial and error we eventually settled on a sweets frequency that seemed to kind of work--he gets a small sweet at both lunch and dinner every day, and then he sometimes gets a few M&Ms in his trail mix or chocolate chips instead of blueberries in his muffins at snacktime, and then sometimes we also have bigger desserts like a slice of cake.  Increasing the frequency definitely helped with making my kid less frantic for more more more of sweets whenever they showed up, so that was awesome and it really felt like we were making progress.  However, there was nooooooo way he would ever not ask for his post-meal "sweet" (for those of you familiar with DOR, technically dessert should be served with the meal, but kiddo really enjoys picking his own sweet and doing it with the meal was kind of chaotic, so we switched to after and it made things much calmer).  Well, for the past few weeks now, a couple of times each week he has just been so excited to go off and do something after his main course that he completely forgets to ask for a sweet.  Of course, on other days he remembers and is VERY interested :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don\'t aspire to have a sugar-free kid anymore but I also want to feel that it isn\'t going to be a crisis if, say, we go to someone else\'s house for a meal and they don\'t serve dessert, so to have this happening feels like a major milestone.
