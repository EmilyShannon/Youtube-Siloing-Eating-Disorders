Neutral,"Any ideas on exercises that mentally disabled people could do with no equipment?  I recently started in a workshop for mentally disabled (most of which also have physical problems).

The mental disabilities are on a level where exercises would need to be as simple as possible. (Their mental age is often 6 and below.

The facility has little resources so equipment is not in our reach.
As of now, every single one of our clients are heavily overweight due to a terrible diet (which we eon't have any say over) as well as a lack of exercise.
So I decided it may be possible to chance something on that front.

I'm thankfull for all suggestions."

Eric has PhD in exercise physiology with a focus on sports nutrition and supplementation, and Greg is a former record-holder in powerlifting who’s lost nearly 60 pounds in the past year since transitioning away from the sport. They have not only released a bundle of 28 free strength training programs to help meet fitness goals, but have also developed a premium nutrition tracking app (MacroFactor) to help really dial in your daily diet! You can find them at https://www.strongerbyscience.com/ and https://www.macrofactorapp.com, where you can browse their free resources, research library, and in-depth nutrition and exercise content to see the science behind building a healthy lifestyle! 

As many folks who have worked on managing their weight already know, gaining control over your diet can be the hardest step: learning how to log calories, wading through information about macros, and successfully implementing new choices/behaviors around food choices can be a real challenge. Stronger by Science is here in r/loseit to talk about their experiences with managing nutrition, and answer your questions about building a healthier lifestyle! So, get your questions ready for Eric and Greg, and prepare to ask them anything! 

NB: This AMA was planned before the recent announcement from MyFitnessPal (about changes to their subscription model). We at r/loseit do not endorse any specific calorie tracking app over another. We are a staff of volunteers who have no financial interest in any specific app or program.

Neutral,"Examine.com Updated Their Website  In case you haven't seen it, [Examine.com](https://examine.com/) launched their new site. For those of that don't know, it's a website that had it's beginnings in this very community about a decade ago because the creators were tired of all the misinformation around nutrition and supplements in the fitness community. Since then they all haven't stopped working and have been expanding more and more, adding new supplements and all the relevant research at what seems like a weekly basis. It's basically a heavily researched/cited Supplements wiki.

They just came out with their new and possibly improved? website design, which is the first update in years. Looks like instead of just focusing on supplements they're also going to be expanding their horizons. Looks pretty cool.

As a healthcare provider I use the website somewhat regularly because my patients always have questions and while I try to be well read, it's impossible to keep up with everything by yourself. So I do a dive, and tell them what stuff their sketchy naturopath prescribed them is actually just a huge waste of money/cash grab, and what actually might help. I always of course always stress that healthy eating habits, exercise, adequate sleep, and reducing causes for stress are always the four pillars, but on top of that supplements can help for stuff, particularly in certain situations (living far enough north of the equator/working indoors during the day and Vitamin D supplementing, if you can't get enough protein from regular food, supplementing, if you can't get enough fiber from food, supplement, and so on). 

Linking directly to the actual studies has always been the biggest thing for me, because sometimes you want to just do the deep dive lit review. But I like the increasing information on the website as well for the times when I'm feeling lazy. I like how it looks quite a bit more streamlined/things are more integrated.

Do I exclusively search for hotels that have an onsite gym? Most hotels I've been to in America have crummy cardio focused ""fitness centers"" with dumbbells that go up to only 50lb. Should I purchase a multi-city gym membership at a chain gym for a month? Do I just exploit free trials and day passes at local gyms?

I'd like to know your thoughts and experiences. Thanks!"

Neutral,"What is a good daily fitness habit that you can't start as a beginner, but should build up to?  Context: I'm close to finishing the good ol' C25K, doing casual calisthenics on rest days (planning on going serious later), doing sun salutations after waking up, and about to finish reading Spark, which has led me to this doubt. The book talks about the great mental health benefits of aerobic exercise and recommends building up to a daily active routine. I've fallen in love with running and would do so every morning if I built it up to the point a 30-minute jog is as casual as going out for a walk.

This got me to wonder, what are other things you could build up to that may start as actual workouts but could benefit you as a habit? I was thinking of experimenting with a daily failure set of push ups, squats, calf raises, band pull-aparts and/or some ab work and see where that ends up; the goal here is not a proper workout, but rather physical activity that keeps the machine running, I suppose, without taxing my recovery.

Do you have any ideas of specific habits to try or advise on implementing such habits?"

Disordered,"DEXA scans and other inaccuracies  Really good article from u/gnuckols today on body composition ""measurements,"" including DEXA. This is a subject that comes up here from time to time, so...

Here's the article: [https://macrofactorapp.com/body-composition/](https://macrofactorapp.com/body-composition/)

Some relevant quotes:

>The first thing to know is that there’s no way of *measuring* body composition in living, breathing humans. There is exactly one way to *measure* body composition: carefully dissecting a cadaver, and weighing each component of the cadaver after completing the dissection. That’s certainly a morbid fact to ponder, but it’s the bedrock of body composition assessment.  
>  
>If you’ve never been dissected – since you’re reading this article, I assume you haven’t – you’ve never had your body composition *measured*. You’ve only had your body composition *estimated*. Understanding this fact is important for two reasons. First, it invites a simple question: “what IS actually being measured in order to estimate body composition?” Second, it invites us to consider the validity and reliability of body composition estimates.

I was already familiar with the pitfalls of BIA scales (and other devices that use conductive pads on your hands or feet to estimate body fat %) but I never got a DEXA scan or even gave DEXA much thought, so I only had a vague sense that there is some inaccuracy but wasn't sure where it might come from. This was eye opening (emphasis mine):

>Due to the relatively expensive and high-tech nature of these scanners, people often assume that their body composition estimates are nearly perfect. However, there are some noteworthy limitations that are rarely acknowledged outside of academic journals. For example, DEXA scanners are unable to directly measure tissue thickness, so **they are forced to derive composition estimates of a 3-dimensional body from a 2-dimensional scan**. Further, the devices are only able to estimate soft tissue composition (i.e., the relative content of lean tissue and fat tissue) in pixels that contain no bone mass. For most scans, about 40% of the total pixels will contain bone, so **nearly half of the scan is essentially uninterpretable** (without assumption-driven calculations) for the purpose of body fat estimation.

We often assume that even if a method is a little bit off, it will still be consistent enough to help us measure changes over time. That's not always true, though. When it comes to BIA scales, I noticed that my scale never changes its estimate very much even when I've made significant changes to my body composition. Research bears this out; scales aren't very useful this way.

Here's how that may shake out with DEXA (this quote comes after a detailed example, worth clicking through and reading the whole thing):

>If DEXA says you lost 14kg of fat and 6kg of lean mass, that actually means you lost somewhere between 10-18kg of fat, and somewhere between 2-10kg of lean mass. In other words, DEXA is telling you that the outcome of your diet was somewhere between “unambiguously good” and “catastrophically bad.”

This doesn't mean scans are useless, but we should probably be taking them with a huge grain of salt - which may make some of us reconsider whether we want or need one."

Neutral,"Why do I struggle so much on single leg exercises and how can I improve my balance with them?  So lately I’ve been wanting to start incorporating single leg exercises into my leg days because I want to work on my upper glutes. The problem is whatever I try (split squats and leg press) my balance is so off and/or I can barely do any weight. For example when I use the seated leg press, with both legs I am able to get to 110-130lbs but when I try to do a single leg one (with full range of motion) I can barely do 5 reps at 10lbs! I also tried split squats at a 6 in elevation just body weight and I just can’t seem to get myself back up, same with any variation of lunges. I’m not sure if it’s a balance thing or weight thing, I hip thrust 135 and rdl 88 regularly. What are ways I can improve my balance or any advice on what my issue may be? I’ve searched Reddit for the answer and couldn’t find anything (other than some very weird subs I did not know existed) and google just showed my HOW to do the exercises not why I’m unable to do them. I’ve been lifting for about 1.5 years now and any advice would be greatly appreciated:)"

Neutral,"Improving athletic ability  Hello all. I’m not sure to which community to ask this question to but this one looked relevant to me.

I’m a 31 year old guy and growing up I never took up any sports or athletics. 

I started playing table tennis when I was around 22 and I’m quite decent in it. I have taken up badminton as well recently and I’m okay in that too. I’m very poor in football but I have the stamina to run around for an hour of football(astro turf 7vs7). I can jog for 40 mins and my best is 5K in 28 mins.

Here is my problem, in table tennis, badminton, football or any sport I cannot generate the power I see others doing. They are quite bad at the sport and I can beat them(in table tennis and badminton) but the power they generate on some of the shots I can only dream of. I’m hitting with all my might but I can never get that acceleration and power. Even in football I cannot generate the power to kick the ball far. Guys who are thinner and weaker than me are generating that power effortlessly. 

I have taken up gym as well recently to improve my power and I have never been to gym ever in my life. But still I’m no good. What is it that I lack in general? What type of exercise should I take up to improve on this? 

What I have noticed is that i can generate the acceleration these other guys seems to produce. In all the above sports I read constantly that I should not tense up the body but no matter how loose I hold rackets or keep my legs loose I can never generate that power.

How do I train for that? Any ideas. Sorry for the long post."

Neutral,"How do you start training safely with depression and fatigue?  I have previous experience of building muscle and strength primarily through big compound lifts and eating/resting. I went from scrawny to decent size and enjoyed the strength gains. 

However, depression and anxiety disorders and other medical issues have resulted in me feeling so fatigued all the time that I gave up on high intensity exercise. The medical issues are gone now but the depression/anxiety is still there and I still feel fatigued.

Do you have experience of working through such situations? Have you trained anyone with such problems? I just want to know what type of stuff could be a safe way for me to test how much my body can handle. 

I have already tried daily walks up to 1hr 45mins (spread out) and it only had positive outcomes for me. Now that I am able to walk at least an hour daily, I want to test if I can get back to resistance training.

I'm trying this website that Dropbox recommended as it tracks how many people access it, which I thought would be fun to see. I've never used it before so if it sucks feel free to tell me and suggest a better website that can handle the bandwidth.

I've considered doing the same notes compilation on coaches and professors like Mike Israetel, Matt Huberman, and Nathan Payton, but the problem is that it takes so much time that it's tough to do as a side-hobby. If there's enough interest I may dedicate time to it. Someday you may see my 840+ saved Instagram stories of Nathan Payton answering diet and training questions turned into notes, but for now, please accept these 70 pages as my guilt offering for being lazy.

_________Example of What's in the Notes_________

**Quick Intro:**

These are 6 months worth of reading books, watching documentaries, listening to podcasts, and trying new methods of training all in my pursuit to be more fit.  That said, I've decided to share notes I've taken on the three coaches I consider to be the top teachers and doers of the strength, conditioning, and nutrition industry, whose pedigree spread across the experienced  trenches of Olympians, US Special Operations, World Strongest Man, UFC, NFL, etc --just to name a few. Now, they are by no means the holders of the gospel of fitness, nor are they the only voices worth listening to, but here's why I chose who I chose:

**Philosophy of Choice:**

* Achievements in personal fitness - need to be fit, and have fitness results in their own life. Can't be all head knowledge or studies. No book worms or science nerds without the in-the-trenches experience.
* Achievements in client fitness - need to have produced results in others lives, because knowing what works for you is vastly different than being able to identify, correct, and advance what works for others.
* Renown and respected by the community - peers need to recognize contributions to the community
* Longevity - How long have they been in the game? How long have they stayed healthy? How long have they been training clients? All important questions in establishing reputation.


**Why I Chose Stan Efferding:**

> To me, Stan is the summation of an average guy with absolute discipline who's taken the best advice from the best gurushe's personally trained with from around the world for decades, and becoming himself an absolute beast. I chose Stan because of his humble demeanor, and because he's also one of the strongest bodybuilders in the world. Additionally, he has trained the Mountain to win his first Arnolds Strongest Man 2018 this past March.

>* Blue collar guy who presents some info. No tips or tricks. Turned over every rock looking for the secret. Spent loads of money, and there is only one answer: sleep, eat, and train.
* Matt Wenning calls him ""the strongest bodybuilder on planet earth.""
* Helped get Hapthorr ""The Mountain"" diet in check, where he set records in elephant bar (1000lbs+) and bag-over-bar, and take first as Arnolds Strongest Man 2018.
* Coached various bikini competitors, NBA, NFL, MLB, UFC, etc
* Worked with Brian Shaw's diet and helped him achieve second place at Arnolds Strongest Man 2018.
* Coaching Larry Wheels (aesthetic and powerful beast) and Dan Green. 
* Has trained with almost every guru in the business, directly or indirectly.
* Former bodybuilding and powerlifting competitor. 
* Squats in the 800lbs+ at 50+ years of age.


**Why I Chose Charles Poliquin:**

> One of the first world renown and truly experienced strength coaches of the modern era. ""Research catches up to Charles,"" has been said about his bleeding edge yet common sense approach to training. While considered by a few to be the king of psuedo-science, the ironic part of this claim is that from all my note-taking from the past 6 months --from books on Green Berets to interviews with the Mountain to 3-hour long seminars with various teachers-- Charles cites his sources and explains the history of what he's talking about more often than any other individual or source I've been reading, watching, or listening.

> * One of the best and most distinguished strength coaches in the world.
* Trained various Special Operations (Seal Team 6, SAS included)
* Coached the US womens team to win their first Olympic gold in history, and defeated Japan in their 20 year reign.
* 38+ years of Olympian training across 23 different sports, went to 3 different Olympics as a coach. Also have trained various high-level professional athletes and coaches in the military, Crossfit, NFL, NHL, MLB, etc.
* Researches studies from as far back as 1890's
* Ability to recall information, facts, research papers, all to the date, location of study, and to the author/researcher, a skill second to no other fitness expert (reminds me of the level of expert recall Robert McNaramara displays in the documentary ""Fog of War"").
* Lectures around the world with book authors like Jay Papasanas, Ed Coan, and world renown athletes like Dmitry Klokov.
* Always ahead of the curve (attributed as first in the US to recommend BCAAs, fish oils, German Volume training,  tempo training, cluster training, neuro transmitter profile training, etc).
* Stan Efferding, Matt Wenning, and Mark Bell have all implemented information from Charles into their personal training, and how they train clients, and all speak highly of him.
* Has huge biceps and abs for an old man.

**Why I Chose Matt Wenning:**

> I chose Matt because of his personal and professional achievements. Hired to train various Special Operations for the military and is the first to be implemented at a large scale. His methods have reduced injury rates across the board for fire, police, and military (and thus saved money for those organizations), and is a master of training and preventing overtraining.

> * Multiple records in the squat alone, including a 1196lb squat.
* Broke 4 world records; second highest RAW at 208 class with 2204lb total.
* Works with thousands of US military, including various Ranger regiments, 4th Infantry, and paratroopers out of Bragg. 
* Developed Mountain Warrior Athlete program out of Ft. Carson.
* Clients include NFL, US Special Operations, law enforcement, fireman, professional athletes, universities, elderly (difficult to train and yield safe results) and kids with disabilities
* His training with first responders and military has reduced site budgets significantly, due to decreased injuries and insurance claims.
* Attended university in Indiana where NASA funded the strength and conditioning programs and recruited top-tier professors.
* Top ten in the world for almost two decades with no major injuries (rare in the strength industry)
* Masters degree in sports biomechanics under Dr. Kramer
* Trained closely and mentored by various powerlifting legends like Louie Simmons, Ed Coan from his teen years, and was one of the youngest to squat 900lbs

**Notes on Notetaking:**

> Each section of notes will include everything I felt was noteworthy, even if it's repeated 3 times in 3 other podcasts. I did this as people will cherry-pick which seminars they want notes on, and I don't want them to miss out on key information just because I wrote it down elsewhere. Also, rehearing the same things over and over again just works as positive reinforcement and mentally conditioning good habits. Can't hurt to hear solid advice over and over again.

> Additionally, these notes are taken as a stream-of-thought process and later revised and edited, so they may seem short, fluid, or lacking in information. I reread the notes a few times and tried to expand and clean up, but I will have missed some parts.

> **Compilation of Notes Regarding Training Women:** (work in progress)

> * For the female lifter: 10-minute walks better than 40 minute treadmill. Doesn't breakdown muscle, still helps with fat loss. 
* If on a limited calorie diet, then the caloric limit will yield results in body composition and performance based on the choice of foods, not just calorie choice. Choose nutrient rich foods like steak.
* 3oz of OJ or milk a couple times a day: liver and thyroid stimulus for metabolism. 
* Long cardio has high water demand. Sends wrong message to body: body holds on to fat to endure the longer workload. Also, body thinks heavy muscle is bad, gets rid of it.
* Stan noticed how joggers carry fat.  Body holds on to fat for fuel, gets rid of muscle. Body responds to stimulus you provide.
* Still need to develop cardio. Recommends HIIT under load: improves cardio while stimulating muscle. Weighted exercises with higher reps (why Matt and Stan recommend loaded exercise under distance). Performing 20 rep sets, or 30 second rest between weighted carries, running stairs (all concentric loading), pushing prowlers, 30s sprint/rest on recumbent bike (ten mins) are all great examples of cardio development.
* ""How do you talk people into losing weight by lifting weights?"" Cites his 60 year old women who lift weights and are lean. They don't have prior exercise experience, and they're stronger than most men.
* How much weight you have on you is 80% diet. Cardio isn't what gets bikini and stage competitors lean, it's they eat better. ""Don't want to be huge? Don't eat huge.""
* When you start training weights you start to retain water, so swelling occurs. Hypertrophy occurs, diet cleans up, everything will lean out.
* ""Foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue."" Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* Research: Sleep loss limits fat loss. Insulin resistance goes up; blood pressure goes up; hunger goes up; cortisol (breaks down muscle tissue; decreases testosterone, effects your thyroid; etc)
* Juicing and detox is completely worthless. All you can do is optimize how your body filtrates toxins, which is the liver. Best way to detox is to just not put the processed foods and oils into your body.
* 10 minute walks for athletes wanting to gain weight, with caloric gain. Also female competitors in bikini, but with calorie deficit. Helps digestion and insulin resistance. 
* Stan trained 40-50 minutes morning, 30 mins at night.
* Women tend to restrict and end of missing much needed fats and nutrients. Ability to absorb nutrients depends on using fats as a shuttle.
* ""*There's no black and white, there's only gray. Find out what fits you and do that*""
* States foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue. Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* If not yet deserving then stick to glutamine, amino acids, and whey. Losing body fat will make you more insulin sensitive.
* Steady-state cardio will cause you to get fatter. 
* Restricting fats causes fat. Fats help with insulin sensitivity.
* **Common mistakes with trainers and female clients:** not wanting to get strong. Not enough time on overload with women (don't have goals for strength). Short term goals to comply to regarding big lifts. Lean muscle tissue leads to insulin sensitivity.
* Believes most women in the gym are busy, not productive 
* Better glute development: split squats, squats, deadlifts (all of which develop horizontal and vertical jump). 



**TL;DR/Top Ten Changes I've Personally Made From These Lessons:**

There's a million bits of info in these notes, but here's some ten takeaways I was able to implement over the course of two months.

1. **Carbs:** Carbs are not the enemy, but need to be heavily regulated and based on individual performance, digestive health, and body-fat. Ethnic background is a huge factor. That being said, Charles states ""you need to earn your carbs,"" while Stan is more lenient, but still recommends you keep them low if you're not an elite athlete. If you do choose to eat carbs, white rice is the best carb as it doesn't cause inflammation or digestive issues like potatoes and brown rice can.
2. **Sleep:** The greatest anabolic, absolutely necessary. The elite performers sleep 10-12 hours a day, including long naps during the day. Important to muscle growth, fat loss, and hormone regulation. I dim the lights 2 hours before bed, do my best to not check my phone, tv, or any electronic screen to improve sleep quality. 
3. **Programming:** I've split my workouts with 72-hours between muscle groups. Using a variety of exercises helps overall performance by choosing accessory work that addresses weaknesses. ""Exercise rotation and having a big exercise library prevents injury while allowing constant key movements."" Only 4 main heavy days, with the other days as options for accessory or cardio.
4. **Food choice:** Grass-fed meat research isn't proven yet, and doesn't justify the price. Eat quality cuts of beef, bison, and wild game. ""Otherwise, the best diet is the one you stick to."" Just eliminated processed foods and snacks, and choose vegetables and fruits that the body will digest easily ([FodMap](https://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/)). Bought a sous-vide to prepare the Costco Steak, and a rice maker for the white rice. On it for two months and am seeing great results. Personally, I've added lots of berries, avocadoes, baby carrots, nuts, coconut oil, chia seeds to my daily diet. I also add kimchi and guacamole to some meals in order to keep the steak from being too routine. Also drinking 3oz of OJ multiple times a day.
5. **Warm-Up:** Static stretching isn't the best option prior to a lift, and cardio before your lift will cause you to be insulin resistant, preventing fat loss. Either do potentiation exercises, or follow this advice: ""brain should know the range of motion, and weights should get heavier."" Regarding potentiation: find where the weakest links are in the main lift, then pick a moderately light weight, and choose exercises that affect different muscle groups involved in the main lift. For example, the squat might be upper back (a), lower back (b), then hamstrings (c). Doesn't need to be heavy, just consistently volume with minimal rest. 4x25 with no rest: a, b,c, repeat 4 times total. Then rest 3-5 minutes, then you're ready attack the main lift (be if your heavy max or speed work). Matt noticed clients were getting stronger, and form was getting better over time. Matt started off light, but now can do 4x25's of 100lb dumbells on chest warmups. Work your way up. Here's the warm-up in practice with Mike O'Hearn, Stan, and Matt. 
6.  **Walking:** Not just for old people: Ten minute walk, after you eat a meal. Improves digestion, decreases DOMS, helps with insulin sensitivity. ""Blood is the life force, brings in all the nutrients."" Brisk walks with elevated heart outperforms leisure 10k step-walks in fat, heart, cardio benefits. Recommended is 3 ten-minute walks a day. Can replace all steady-state cardio with walks and HIIT. Recommended them to the women in competition and strongmen like the Mountain, both of whom saw fantastic results.
7. **Cardio:** Implemented rucks over distance running, along with adding swimming, cycling, and farmers carries. Long slow-distance work inhibits muscle growth *and* fat-loss. That said, some cardio is required, hence the HIIT, farmers walks, etc as they are recommended. Still learning to program into the workout regimen.
8. **Build the Backside:** If the muscle is behind you, chances are you need to build it stronger. The average person will have weak lower and upper back, hamstrings, glutes, calves, traps, rear delts, etc. Build those up by making them a priority in your accessory exercise selection. For example: Upperback not strong enough will change scapular position on bench press.
9. **Salt:** Upped the intake of my salt. Iodized salt, stimulates thyroid, immune system, stimulates the liver. When you hit a wall, it's because you're low on sodium, not carbs. Guaranteed. Single biggest thing you can do to impact performance, stamina and endurance at the gym is iodized sodium.
10. **Post-workout drink:**  Body super-compensates after a workout, so you need immediate replenishment, especially for two-a-days. Fructose (Orange juice) for liver stimulation, dextrose (scoop off Amazon) for glycogen replenishment, sodium (600mg), 100mg of caffeine (accelerates all of that). No proteins or fats immediately as it slows absorption."

Disordered,"Nuckols: What is the optimal dose of resistance training for longevity?  [Full article here.](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/research-spotlight-lifting-longevity/)

Summary:

> Overall, this meta-analysis offers a perspective that may be really helpful for a variety of people in a variety of circumstances. For example, if a friend, family member, or potential client is interested in getting into resistance training, they may be concerned that they’ll need to live in the gym to reap notable benefits. However, you can tell them that they’ll likely reap most of the health benefits with just 30-60 minutes of resistance training per week, thus massively reducing the perceived barrier to starting. Similarly, plenty of serious lifters find it hard to keep up their desired training schedule due to changes in life circumstances (for example, starting a new job with punishing hours, or having kids). They may want to keep lifting for health reasons, but they aren’t sure if cutting their weekly training time from 4 hours to 1 hour will result in a resistance training dose that’s even worthwhile. Again, this meta-analysis suggests that just 30-60 minutes of resistance training per week is associated with a host of positive health and longevity outcomes, meaning that a considerable reduction in training volume will still result in a worthwhile and meaningful dose of training.

> Conversely, I suspect that most readers probably engage in resistance training for more than 130-140 minutes per week. This meta-analysis suggests that such a training dose may actually be associated with higher all-cause mortality risk, cardiovascular disease risk, and total cancer risk. So, how concerned should you be?

> I’d like to be able to say that you don’t need to be concerned at all (that would certainly fit my biases), but this isn’t the first time that such a relationship has been observed. 

Before we all panic and step away from our longer or more involved programs, some caveats:

> However, it’s also worth mentioning that the studies included in the present meta-analysis were all observational in nature. In other words, they tell us the relationships between resistance training dose and mortality/disease risk, but they can’t tell us that the resistance training dose causes the observed reductions and elevations in risk. 

> With all of that said, there’s one major reason to be skeptical that these results will generalize to all readers: the studies in this meta-analysis mostly used older subjects. It’s entirely possible that the optimal dose of resistance training for older adults is a lot lower than the optimal dose of resistance training for younger adults. For example, oxidative stress and generalized inflammation likely contribute to biological aging, and older adults have higher levels of oxidative stress and generalized inflammation. 

TL:DR- 30-60 minutes of resistance training per week can have major health/longevity benefits."

Neutral,"Can I get the ""gym shape"" without going to the gym?  Hi everyone, I'm a 21 year old male who recently suffered a retinal tear. I've been advised to not lift heavy weights (like ever) and not do contact sports for practically the rest of my life.  


As someone who is quite passionate about the gym, is it possible for me to maintain my fitness goals of getting the gym shape without lifting weights? I understand that cardio and such can help me get lean, but I'd want to have fairly defined arms, shoulders etc as I was working towards before my incident. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!

Edit: Thanks for the replies! I should add though that calisthenics are probably a big no no due to the internal pressure it creates. and i can't really strain or do anything with my head below my torso :/

I will definitely listen to ophthalmologists first and foremost, I was just hoping to hear some experiences from others in similar situations. Additionally, I was never aiming to be buff or ""big"". I'm going from overweight to lean so I know cardio will play a big part regardless of my situation, but I'm just looking for ways to still have the upside down triangle shape and maintain my traps, arms etc"

Neutral,"Is there an objective standard of physical prowess that everyone should aim to?  I heard Peter Attia say that in his clinic, a 50 year old patient is asked to stay at the level equivalent to his own 40 year old at peak performance.

I believe they do mainly strength training (weight lifting), ""cardio"" (what he calls zone 2), and something resembling HIIT.

What left me wondering is: what is this ""peak performance"" he mentions? And what does it mean for me? As a 37 y.o., what physical feats should I be able to perform, even if I'm not an athlete? What are the things that everybody should be able to perform in some measure, and is there some kind of standard?

If somebody asked you: ""what physical things everybody should aim to be able to perform for as long as they live?"" (doesn't mean they can now, or at 70 or at 90, but that they should aim to)

So even if there is no consensus whatsoever, it would be interesting to simply know what is your answer to this

I'll write some completely random examples to give you an idea:

\- Deadlift your own body weight 3 sets 5 reps

\- Able to full squat (until your but touches the floor)

\- Run 5 km in 30 minutes

\- Bike 100 km within one day

\- Climbing a 5 meter tall tree

\- Walk from sunrise to sunset

\- Horse stance 15 minutes

\- Dive 20 meters deep

If you want to say, ""it depends on your goals"". Then assume the goal would be to maintain a great physical health through one's entire life, including very old age.

Edit: Lol, didn't expect so many comments. The examples above are completely random and non-sensical. I didn't try to think of a ""standard"" myself."

Disordered,"How to convince myself to not overreach/overtrain?  Hi All,

I don’t post much if ever but I’ve recently had an issue where, even though I do workout a lot, I’ve started feeling myself actually getting weaker.

I box as my main sport, at the very amateur level, and I had a pretty gnarly concussion in Feb that took me out. Before then I was in the best shape of my life, working out sometimes twice a day (strength in morning, boxing in evenings), doing proper recovery, and feeling great. I took nearly a month off after the concussion since I could barely walk the first two weeks. I was almost at the point where I feel like I’m near the same shape as before.

The issue is, especially in my legs, my body seems to tire and fatigue during intense workouts way easier than I remember - to the point where last week my coach noticed and questioned me on it. 

I’m thinking I need to potentially take more recovery and slow down, but honestly I hate doing that. I like exercising hard, pushing myself, and I feel like shit when I don’t. To others that had a similar situation where they need to lay off the gas - what did y’all do to convince yourself it was ok? 

TL;DR : How do you work out less to emphasize recovery without feeling lazy?"

Disordered,"Main Lift Tracker, Accessory Progression, and 5/3/1 FSL + nSuns Plate Calculator Spreadsheets  I have created several spreadsheets that could hopefully be of some use to whoever wants them. Do not request access. Make your own copy.

**Main Lift Progress Tracker for programs that use a daily AMRAP set (such as most 5/3/1 templates)**

1: Input the monday of the week you start in the blue date cell. By default it is the nearest monday to today, which is 7/4/2022

2: Input your daily weights and reps for the week on the left block in the blue cells.

You can change what the main lifts are, just do so on the top of the left block, and the rest will fix.

The middle block displays the exact estimated 1rm for each lift *no matter which version you use*, next to it will be the total of your S/B/D (the OHP is included on the individual lift graph, NOT the big 3 total), with the difference between each week next to that, then the right side will graph your lifts depending on the spreadsheet. The maximum Y value will change according to your lifts. Your big 3 totals will not appear until every main lift for the week is filled and the difference between weeks will not appear until you have the weeks logged. It was done this way so the graphs don't just read a 0 for information that has not yet been logged.

There are 2 different versions that graph the lifts a bit differently. These should both be accessible now, let me know if they aren't!

[True Main Lift Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18QYKjgNxZqONf0ar9_wvrVO8m9hNds8iiEs9icMKi7c/edit#gid=1219405196) Graphs your 1rm estimates.

[Max Main Lift Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jEvQDsu4qbzKFFX2X9xva4AYAIKkNSmLl3KxDyDOxZg/edit?usp=sharing) Graphs your best lift to date. If your bench numbers go from (200,190,210), it will ignore the dip and instead graph (200,200,210). Your Big 3 total and graph will also be your maxes to date. I like this one because the dips are upsetting, and I know I didn't truly lose that strength, I just had a less than perfect day. (it also makes the trendline look nicer ;))

&#x200B;

Not the main point of the post, or really anything special, but I have them so I figured I would share these:

**SBS Accessory Progression**

This is an automated accessory progression based on a post by Greg Nuckols I made for use in the SBS templates. I had this in my SBS Hypertrophy sheet but pasted it into a new sheet to share, because the SBS programs are paid and I of course can't share those, so this will look pretty bare bones.

Your goal is to perform a total of 40 reps in 3 sets. If you succeed, you then do 50 in 4 sets with the same weight. Then the weight bumps up an increment and you begin again at 40 reps in 3 sets. If you fail any day, it will not progress, and the weights, reps, and sets will stay the same until you beat it. This is why all of the weights, reps, and sets will look the same for each week before you start progressing.

Fill in the blue cells with the name, smallest increment, and starting weight of the lift. To progress, fill in the total amount of reps completed in the blue cells each week.  Create a new column to the left of column B on the SBS sheet. Highlight and copy all 4 rows of the accessory sheet, then highlight and paste it over the 4 rows where the accessories are on SBS. Google sheets is creating some odd borders when you paste it, so you could just highlight the 4 rows afterwards and select ""Borders > Clear Borders"" on the top of the screen.

[SBS Accessory Progression](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CWTL0ND7DoPqhhLkGKYmna5dSv2msEcXDWScvjSFzAI/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

**5/3/1 and nSuns 5 day LP With Plate Calculators**

Fill in your barbell weight and plates from heaviest (left) to lightest (right). Not every plate cell has to be filled. If your plates do not add up evenly to the weight of a set, the calculator for that set will display ""Plates Do Not Add Up!"". The 5/3/1 template will have a dropdown for different supplemental options (FSL, SSL, and BBB (3 popular ones that are not paid))

I did not create any programs listed here. They are originally available in the fitness wiki, and the SBS bundle can be purchased from strongerbyscience."

I'm a lapsed cyclist trying to get back into training in time for an upcoming triathlon. What I really enjoy, far more than 'training for the sake of training' is going for long multi-day cycle tours, often carrying a tent and wild camping. As a student, 5+ day trips of 80-100 mile days with 20+kgs of equipment on the back up the hills of Scotland & northern England lead to some of the best fitness of my life. So it leads me to wonder.

### ***May 2019 - May 2020 (1 Year) / 1 to 5 Reps:***

Gym hosted a [Murph Challenge](https://themurphchallenge.com/pages/the-workout) & I had to sub in lat-pulldowns for pull-ups after 5 poor reps. This was when I decided to try & improve. I worked out 4x a week in a group strength training class & began adding pull-ups at the end of each class. As you might expect, attempting pull-ups after a strenuous strength class 4x a week didn't lead to great gains. After a year, I could only do 5-7 slightly better reps.

### ***Jun 2020 - Nov 2020 (6 months) / 5 to 11 Reps:***

Gym reopened after being closed for the first half of the year (*COVID)* & I decided to get right back to it. I started doing 3 sets of pull-ups, at the start, middle & end of my workouts (*solo strength training + FIT45 classes 5-6x a week*). I didn't set a fixed rep goal but would go until just shy of failure for each set.

By Oct 2020, I was consistently hitting 8-9 reps but was struggling to get 10 reps. I sought advice from r/bodyweightfitness & weighted pull-ups were recommended. That did it! On Nov 6, 2020, I got my first 10 rep set. I spent the rest of the year cleaning up my form & ended with 11 reps on Dec 31, 2020.

### ***Jan 2021 - Oct 2021 (9 months) / 10 to 15 Reps:***

My initial pull-up goal had been to hit 10 reps  & I didn’t have any strong motivation to do more. I felt fine sticking with 10 reps. By end of summer 2021, I realised 10 reps weren't providing a stimulus anymore. I could do them no matter the conditions (*hungry, sore, tired etc.*). At this point, I was familiar enough with the concept of progressive overload & decided it was time to increase reps, volume & weights for all sets. On Oct 15, 2021, I got my first 15 rep set. I was very proud of it & made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/q8mf7y/bw_pullup_milestone_15_reps/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on Fitness30plus. At this point I knew I wanted to keep going until I could get a 20 rep set.

### ***Oct 2021 - Jun 2022 (8 Months) / 15 to 20 Reps:***

I chose to stick with the same principles of increasing reps, volume & weights to hit 20 reps. On Jan 4, 2022, I got 16 reps. Again, I felt quite proud & [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/rvtdqu/pullup_pr_16_reps/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on Gym about it. On Jan 6, 2022, I got 17 reps. I didn't make a post but [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rzofqs/comment/hrwkgld/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on the Fitness Victory Sunday thread. On Jan 9, 2022, I tested positive for COVID. My illness was mild. I rested & isolated for 10 days & got back in the gym on Jan 19.

Mild or not, it did me in cardio-wise. My strength came back quickly but I struggled to catch my breath. My chest-strap heart rate monitor would show my HR spiking up & down erratically. I like to play this game with my HRM ([*my tile displays on a TV*](https://www.myzone.org/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Tiles-1.jpg?width=700&height=500&name=Tiles-1.jpg)) where I move as much as possible to stay in the yellow zone (*80-89% of maximal heart rate*) but I put a stop to that & focused on not over-exerting myself. I dialed down the reps, volume & weights for everything & intentionally didn't ramp up until April 2022.

On May 7, 2022, I got 19 reps. I didn't make a post, but I [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ukxqgs/comment/i7s5yf4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) again on the Fitness Victory Sunday thread. On June 13, 2022, I got 20 reps on my 2nd set as I failed my 1st set.

# 4. Training

I brute-forced my training & while it eventually paid off, I should have trained smarter. I don’t recommend this & suggest following a program. [The Fighter Pull-up Program](https://www.strongfirst.com/the-fighter-pullup-program-revisited/) is highly recommended.

That said, if you'd like to be a mad person & wing it, the core tenets of my ramshackle training are; (1) Don't go to failure on working sets, (2) Pump up the volume, (3) Add weight & (4) Mind your form.

There are many resources for pull-ups, but I especially like this video, [The Perfect Pull Up by Calisthenic Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGo4IYlbE5g)  & this brilliant post, [The Elusive Pull-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/lrgeht/the_elusive_pullup/) by u/stephnelbow.

I used a rack at the gym 98% of the time. I used a pull-up bar at home & playground bars for the other 2%. I used gloves initially (*I dislike calluses immensely*) but with time my grip strength improved to the point I didn’t need them. I also bought a [Harbinger Dip Belt](https://www.amazon.com/Harbinger-Polypropylene-Steel-Chain-Black/dp/B001P0S3XU?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1) once I started adding weights.

I didn't train only pull-ups these 3yrs. From Jun 2020 to Dec 2021, I ran a GZCLP program, attended FIT45 classes 3x a week, did LISS cardio & completed a 1yr bulk. In Jan 2022,  I switched to the 5/3/1 BBB program, I'm continuing FIT45 classes, LISS cardio & trying to eat at a slight surplus daily.

# 5. Miscellaneous

Yes. I know. Legs straight down & pointed. Trust me, I know. I can do them that way, but I don't like it. Legs crossed is easier for me. Please let me live purists :)

I'm going to stick with 20 reps until it becomes ""easy"". I remember when 10 reps became easy & I hope to get there with 20 reps.  I'd also like to learn how to do a muscle-up or two.

Finally, a shoutout to u/SelfiesSuck. Almost a year ago he made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/lgv746/finally_hit_my_goal_of_getting_20_pullups_in_one/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) & I was so impressed. I saved that post & came back to it many times for inspiration. Thank you.

Disordered,"How to build a routine for aggressive skating or a specific athletic/sport goal  Hi all, this one's a bit longer so TLDR; I'm looking for how to build a routine that helps support a specific sport (my sport is aggressive inline) that includes strength, stability, power, and conditioning while still leaving time to actually do the sport. 

I've looked through the wiki and done some research but I'm kind of stuck. I used to be quite fit in general but dropped off for a couple years. Got back into it and have been doing mostly conditioning for the past week. My goals are to get back into aggressive inline skating but supplement with workouts to help improve my strength, cardio, and stability/balance (essentially overall athleticism). The program I'm following so far (with some variations like Australian pull-ups instead of pull-ups) is [this one](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/routine/workouts/workout-routines/ultimate-workout-program-be-all-around-athlete/) but it's almost entirely conditioning and I feel I'm not really going to gain much in terms of strength since I'm not doing anything with heavy weights (deadlifts, barbell squats, etc). 

Looking around at other routines it looks like heavy weight days and conditioning days are mixed in, like [this one](https://betterme.world/articles/athlete-workout-plan-how-to-train-like-a-pro/) which literally uses the same conditioning and power production days as the one I'm following but combines them together to add in an Upper/Lower weighted split. 

What I'm confused about:

1) With a 5 day regimen like this, when am I supposed to actually go out and do my sport? On my rest days? On the same day as I'm doing training? 

2) Is combining conditioning with heavier weights the way to go? How can get a good balance?

I've also considered doing something like a 3-day PPL split plus one day power production and one day conditioning with aggressive skate training fit somewhere in there at least twice a week and yoga 1-2 times a week to focus on stability. Does this sound good, and how should I schedule these workouts? 

I'm just generally lost how to work out for a specific athletic goal instead of for pure strength, cardio, or vanity muscles, since I've never had to do so before."

Neutral,"Best Boxing workout programs and Best ""smart"" Boxing equipment?  Hi r/fitness!  

I have recently gotten very interested in obtaining some boxing equipment for my home gym to implement some extra cardio into my regimen. I am not looking to be a professional, just want something fun to add to my cardio game.  

I have been looking at some different smart technology boxing equipment:  

1. DribbleUp: These are smart gloves that would track progress, comes with some type of app with workouts. I would need my own bag. Smart Gloves: $75; Bag: ??; Continued membership to the app $14/mo 
2. QuietPunch: Small punching bag which attaches to a doorframe that has a smart sensor in itself to track progress, comes with gloves and has some type of app that has workouts. Smart Bag plus gloves: $239; Lifetime membership to the app included
3. FightCamp: Full size stand up professional looking kick and punching bag, gloves, smart trackers. $999; Membership to the app $39/mo  

So as you can see these are all kinda pricey. I really like the idea of tracking my progress which is why I am considering the ""smart"" equipment in the first place.  

My question is, what is everyones opinion on what would be the best choice?  

Should I just get my own bag, maybe the smart gloves, and look for workout videos online?  

Related question: Does anyone here currently have a membership to an online boxing workout platform (an app, trainer, or gym you follow for workouts) paid, or free?

Neutral,"What does a cut accurately look like for you?  Personally, I have struggled with the concept of ""cutting"" and staying consistent for a period of time. I'm 5'11 and about 191, roughly 20 ish % body fat. I have a solid muscular foundation and know I would look great with a 10-15 pound cut. Recently took some medical board exams and lost my mojo (mind gets locked into study mode). I was really consistent with the gym prior for several months, better than ever actually, but I feel like my diet is always the same.

I find myself snacking/eating shit food on weekends (only at nights) especially mixed with alcohol. I love relaxing and taking a weekend night to enjoy myself, but I fear that eating ""junk"" food has become an activity to me mentally. If I want to get lean, what are some ways I can approach this behavior? I don't want to avoid alcohol and junk food entirely, but I feel like my current habits are always limiting my progress. I know having a leaner body would make me feel happy, but I debate whether that happiness is surface level based on societal standards. "

Disordered,"Can you help me lift my disabled son?  My son is disabled. It is unlikely he will be able to walk and will probably be non-verbal as he gets older. I'm looking to prepare for my son growing heavier and in particular, preparing for lifting him in/out of bed/wheelchairs and probably stairs. I work a busy desk job and still being a dad (2 kids, one disabled) I don't have lots of time for the gym. 


I've looked online but I can't see much info around lifting plans for carers. I was hoping that some combination of fireman/army/drunk friend workout tips might help me plan a routine. 


One thing to note, I'm looking to keep injury to a minimum. Tweaking my back for a month will be more than a minor inconvenience putting on socks. 


Some background about my fitness. About 10 years ago I read starting strength and have reasonable form for my compound lifts. I've not been a gym regular for a few years because of being a dad and work. My max lifts were no record breakers because I was very active playing sports year round. 


Also, I'm likely to play some tennis and cycle. I have a gym membership through my sports club (it's a good gym with squat rack etc) and have kettle bells at home and a yoga mat.

Neutral,Gym Story Saturday  Hi! Welcome to your weekly thread where you can share your gym tales!
Neutral,"When do I ""master"" an exercise, in calisthenics?  I started following a calisthenics / bodyweight progression (this one [https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/az79av/new\_and\_improved\_bodyweight\_fitness\_progression/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/az79av/new_and_improved_bodyweight_fitness_progression/))

What I am wondering is: whne can I consider I ""master"" one exercise in the progression?

Some exercises have reps. Being able to do 1 set of 10 reps seems reasonable to me to say ""I can do this"".

Some exercise are about ""holding"", like the plank. 60 seconds seems like a resonable amount of time, but maybe it's too much (Maybe 45 seconds?).

I'm pulling those out of my \*\*\* though.

Or maybe it's more complicated, and it depends on the exercise? (after all, not all muscles have the same size and capabilities)

Is there any generally agreed definition of mastering an exercise, in this sense? What is it? If there isn't, what's your opinion? When should I check one exercise as mastered, and move on to the next exercise in the progression?

I'd appreciate advice

Edit: the reponses tend to focus in the ""Mastering"" vs ""Good enough"" of the question. If I could word my question better, it would be: ""In a bodyweight progression, how many reps / hold time do I need to be able to do to move on the next exercise"".

The concise answer by u/surferguy999 seems reasonable:

\- 3x5 to 3x8 reps

\- 15 seconds to 30 seconds for ""hold"""

Neutral,"Lifting Requires SO Much Sleep - Tips?  I've gone through periods in life where I'm weight training 3x a week for years, and multiple year layoffs due to laziness and life stress.

After recently starting up again, I realize now I had forgotten how crazy sleep requirements are when lifting heavy.

Before I started training again, I could easily get by on 6 hours. This week I've been getting 9 per night and could still use some more!

I remember Arnold saying in a speech to ""sleep faster."" While this seemed to be tongue-in-cheek, I'm wondering if there's more we can do to improve the quality and efficiency of our rest (aside from the magical abilities of exogenous testosterone).

I already avoid stimulants, take magnesium, and sleep in a cool, dark room. Anyone here have any tips on how to ""sleep faster?"""

Disordered,"The Road to Nine Plates  A bit over 3 years ago I pulled 765lbs, 8 plates, for the first time. I [wrote about my experience up to that point and my thoughts on deadlifts in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/aulcv7/8_plate765lb348kg3x_bodyweight_deadlift/). [Today I pulled 865lbs, which is all 9 of my uncalibrated plates.]( https://youtu.be/npDzuNldT2g) I wanted to revisit my old post, and see how things have changed since then. It might be a bit self-indulgent but I hope there is still something of value for others in my looking at how my training and thoughts have evolved over three years and 100lbs of deadlift. 

Having learned my lesson last time, I include [this still]( https://imgur.com/a/fNzpTnp) of my pull as the first linked image so the thumbnail does not auto-populate with the picture of my first deadlift ever. Hopefully this will avoid numerous comments from people who do not read anything besides the title but still feel the need to hear themselves talk.

This was before I programmed it, and just wanted to demonstrate how much I could do to a friend. This was at a shitty 24 gym so I could not say how much the bar or those plates weighed. I am pretty sure the plates are 45lbs based on size and the bar is probably 30-35lbs.

There are a ton of other deadlift and deadlift adjacent PRs in there but the full list would be enormous. These are just highlights. 

**Training History**:

In the initial post I wrote the following: 
>Between the first pull in 2014 and some time around the 600 pull (I do not remember the exact dates) I started running nsuns 531LP. In nsuns 531 LP (5 day) you have two deadlift days, both with ~8 sets of varying weight and reps including one AMRAP on the primary deadlift day. The program suggests sumo deadlifts for the secondary deadlift day but I never clicked with them so I did deficit dead-lifts instead. This program definitely solidified my preexisting aptitude for deadlifts, and I believe the high volume was very beneficial when I was still pulling in this weight range. Despite a day dedicated to deficit work, I still found I was weakest off the ground. I also performed RDLs for a good portion of the time I ran this program as an accessory.
>After that I ran PHAT for about a month but did not like it do I moved on to nsuns CAP3. Nsuns CAP3 also had a primary deadlift day and a day where a deadlift variation was recommended. But stopped doing the variation at this point. The deadlift day was similar in having ~7 sets of deadlift, culminating in a single AMRAP set. At the beginning of the program I ran the full day, but by the end I just did warmups and enough of the initial sets to feel loose then put all my energy into the AMRAP. I ran nsuns CAP3 until the middle of last summer and it took me to the 700 pull. I did not do any deadlift specific accessory work while running CAP3. About the time I pulled 700 I found that I was no longer particularly weak off the ground.
>After nsuns CAP3 I ran my own variation of 531BBB. I had one deadlift day where I just did the 531 sets, the last of which being an AMRAP. Between the second half of my running CAP3 and this program, the last year and a half or so of my deadlift training has basically consisted of warming up and one single max effort AMRAP set a week.

I want to start off by saying that the year and change I did my own programming after 765 was the least productive period of my training career. Seriously, don’t try to do your own programming until you are very experienced, and even then start off with modifying existing programs *slightly*. I am almost a decade in now and only have only recently started to feel that I can really fully program for myself. 

Since then I have run several programs, including a mangled Deepwater, PH3, and Average to Savage 2.0. I have taken ideas from other programs including Gamma Bomb, and 28 Free Programs. The last year plus of training I have been doing a lot of my own programming. The only periods of really focused deadlift training I have done have been in my fall/winter block of high intensity, high frequency Squat/Bench/Deadlift programming. I cover this program and include the spreadsheet in [this post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/s8rgbl/rip_and_tear_program_review_and_discussion_of/?ref=share&ref_source=link) and am working with a training app to possibly get it available for free in an even more user friendly format. 

Other than that my deadlift training has been sporadic. I have trained it a few times with specific goals in mind. Leading up to the 585 x 20 pull I spent 6 weeks pulling 585 x 20 from the floor with increasingly small blocks in a Range or Motion progression method. I found this worked pretty well. Its biggest benefit is that it builds confidence. If you start at a height that is ‘easy’ and work down in small increments you go into each set being pretty sure you can do it. 

Besides these bouts and my fall/winter block I have stopped training deadlifts. Up until todays pull I have barely touched deadlift in the last two months. Most of my deadlift work is in the form of PR attempts and challenge sets in variations of deadlift. I have come to the conclusion that I know how to deadlift, the technique is seared into my soul. I don’t really gain anything from practice at this point. What I do gain, however, is a lot of fatigue. I can’t keep up with a high frequency deadlift program unless I drop the intensity to a pointless level. I put my focus these days into building the strength and size of my muscle with movements other than deadlift, then testing that gain in PR attempts at some later point. 

I will say, in capitals, that I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT SUPPORT THIS APPROACH FOR THE VAST, *VAST* MAJORITY OF PEOPLE. Almost everyone has room for technical improvement in their deadlifts. Very few people are going to have my innate proclivity for the movement. 99.9999% of people are not moving my loads and gathering the kind of fatigue I am. This is a case of do as I say, not as I do. Please train your deadlift, and do not point to me as an excuse for why deadlifts have a bad stimulus to fatigue ratio. I am an exception, you are (probably) not. 

The last thing I will say is that I am making use of a wide variety of deadlift variants. This is not so much a training method, as I don’t use any of them regularly either, but challenging myself with PR sets in other pulling motions helps build my bodily awareness and confidence in pulls. I talk a bit about this idea in [this post about unusual lifting]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tagy4l/the_odd_the_old_and_the_original_the_case_for/?ref=share&ref_source=link). 

**Thoughts on Deadlift**:

In this section I will look at what I said 3 years ago, and amend the statements with my new thoughts, and include new insights that I have gathered since then. 

>Set up is the most important aspect of deadlift. I think it is important in all compounds, but deadlift most of all. If you are set up properly when you start pulling the weight off the ground the lift is going to sort itself off pretty much on it's own. It's a simple movement pattern, the weight is below you and 'hanging' so it has little chance to move out of the center of gravity. The most valuable cue is to pull the slack out of/pre-load the bar.

I still believe this 100%, if anything I would emphasize it even more. The setup is an integral part of a lift and often gets neglected compared to the portion of the lift where you are actually moving. A rock solid setup is the foundation of every lift. In a deadlift, particularly in a single, you need to pull a very heavy weight from a standstill. If you aren’t mentally and physically set up to go from 0 to 60 you are going to lift less than you could be. Most people fail at the floor, and of those that fail higher many fail because they messed up breaking the floor. 

>At high weights, the high volume approach does not work well unless you are using very sub-maximal weights. For the first few weeks of my BBB programming, I tried to do the deadlift BBB sets as well as my squat and front squat BBB sets (5x10 @ 55-60%). This was the first time I ever tweaked something without a single obvious moment in which the injury was caused. I did something to my lower back just from sheer overuse between all those sets. After that I dropped the deadlift BBB sets.

I am still pretty much on board with this. I have gone even father and now look at movements like squat, bench and deadlifts as movements I train to become a better squatter, bencher or deadlifter, not as movements I train to get bigger and stronger generally (though that certainly is a side benefit). I would never use a 5 x 10 compound as a general purpose hypertrophy movement these days, I think there are better alternatives. Most of my barbell compound training these days is a couple relatively easy sets to build technical expertise, then a single hard set to push myself. I don’t use multiple difficult sets for anything other than specific challenges. I do not think this is a universal truth though. It is my personal preference. Plenty of people have built themselves almost exclusively on big compounds, its just not for me. 

>Lowbar squats are an exceptional accessory to deadlifts. I spent over a year doing deficit pulls and still found breaking the floor to be a weakness. After my 635 pull I injured my forearm doing some tricep work and didnt deadlift until about a month before my 700 pull. In this time I heavily focused on lowbar instead, raising it 50lbs. Before this time I was heavily limited in what I could 1RM by weakness off the floor compared to what I could do for multiple reps. Afterwards I never saw it to be a significant weakpoint. I cannot say for sure it was the lowbar focus but I believe it was.

I don’t know if Lowbar is an accessory to deadlift, but I think they feed into each other and both benefit from similar support training. They compliment each other well if your goal is to have big squats and big deads. An issue with them, however, is they have a lot of overlap in muscles used. Part of the reason I have really pulled back on deadlift training is to allow more room for squatting. I still benefit from practicing squats, the more I can work with them the better I can squat. I would go so far as to say if you want to train low bar and conventional deadlift you should probably periodize them at a certain point. If not dropping one movement when working the other at least pick one to reign it back on. But that is just my experience, some people might be able to juggle them better if they have different technique than I do. 

>Touch and go is a completely valid and viable approach to dead lift sets. I do all of my deadlift work touch and go. For me trying to re-establish position and tightness once already fatigued is an issue. With touch and go I never lose position and tightness, so I can push my sets until my muscles won't let me anymore. This is important when my training has boiled down to basically one set a week. On a similar vein, hex plates are not evil. Everything before the 635 pull was done with hex plates, they taught me proper bar control on the way down so as to not have the bar go caddywumpus. [Here is a video from ~~2~~5+ years ago of me doing 405x21 with hex plates](https://youtu.be/RLhMw_u-F9s)

Still support this one completely too. I don’t think they are ‘cheating’, I think that pushing yourself as hard as you can with touch and go versus deadstops is a better way to train deadlifts. I think that they force you to control the eccentric, and maintain a controlled barpath. I think that all of that makes you a better, stronger deadlifter. Also deadstop deadlifts are just a series of singles, its like re-racking the bar between squats, change my mind. 

I don’t think I would want to go back to deadlifting with hex plates though. 

>I do not think that everyone can/should train deadlifts as I have for the last couple years. I have a large natural aptitude for the movement and am moving big weights. When I take a deadlift set to failure, it is to real failure. My AMRAPs on bench and squat fail do in large part to form breakdown as well as muscle failure, my deadlifts do not. I also am moving pretty big weights, so I can pull a lot of stimulus from a single set. If you feel that you are very good (either by natural aptitude or extensive training) at the deadlift form and are moving heavy weights feel free to give it a shot, but if you don't meet those criteria I do not recommend '1 AMRAP a week' as a valid training style.

I already covered this, please don’t try to train like me unless you are also a deadlift savant, you will no get my results. 

Besides these older ideas, which I have not really shifted from it seems, I have some new thoughts. 
Right after pulling 765 I started using straps. I think that training with straps is great, and that you probably should just use them unless you want to powerlift, and even then you should use them in some of your training. When I used mixed grip, a lot of my sets were held back by my grip. My *peak* grip strength was fine, on a good day my PR sets were fine. But not every day is a good grip day. In my experience, grip fluctuates a lot more than the rest of my body, and suffers from systemic fatigue a lot. This meant that I was leaving reps, and sets, on the table when pulling without straps. This held back my training for no good reason. So I started using straps. I still use them for every set because I have no interest in competing in powerlifting, and because I don’t want to start switching back to mixed grip for PR sets. Not only would it suck to fail a set for something as stupid as grip, I don’t think suddenly switching part of my technique (arm orientation) for PR sets is a smart move. 

I’ve also recently started working with a belt for heavy sets. I did not understand how to use a belt for deadlifts for the longest time. Over the last few years I have gotten much better at bracing into a belt, and no longer need to cinch it as tight as possible. This means it no longer gets in the way when deadlifting, so I am working it in. I also recently got a soft underbelt, and I really really like how that feels for deadlifts with the leather lifting belt. I’ll probably continue to use it on heavy sets, but leave it off on longer sets so I can breath more easily. 
The last big thing is I have worried a lot less about a strict deadlift. I have learned how to modify my technique to get the most out of my body and it’s not as pretty, that for sure. But I am not lifting to create a pretty deadlift. I am lifting to pick up the heaviest thing I can. I am going to use my body in the configuration that gives me the most power and stability. This is something that all the odd deadlifts and pulls has really helped me to develop. 

I will also note that, yes, I am aware that I pulled this PR Jefferson. Jefferson stance and Conventional stance have always been close and I just happened to be testing Jefferson maxes today. I have no issue considering this a deadlift PR. It was pulled from the floor and I do not think Jefferson gives any kind of strict benefit over conventional or sumo. I will probably pull 9 plates conventional soon, but this is my first 9 plate pull and I am treating it as such.

**Preparation**:

> To prepare for this lift, and for my bench and squat PR attempts next week I start tapering down volume two week ago. I reduced accessories, and switched my 5x10s for 3-4x4-5s while working up to heavy singles in place of the AMRAPs on a normal 531 week. This last week I just did the work up to heavy singles and some trivial accessories. This week I am taking off the gym period. I planned to do this lift and be peaked this weekend but I was feeling fine yesterday and figured I would give 8 plate a try as I could always try again this weekend if I failed.

I have basically stopped trying to prepare for big deadlifts, or any lift. I do not like operating under a looming deadline for my goals. I don’t like the pressure of having to lift a PR on a specific day. I don’t find that I can really predict when I will be strongest or reliably produce the conditions to hit big lifts. So I let them come when they do. I didn’t prepare for this. I set out planning to hit 820 as part of an entry in an online lifting meet. After it moved so well I hit 840, then 865. I have developed a good deal of patience in my lifts and have embraced the idea that there are a million things you can PR on. I go into more detail on that in [this post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/owm6yc/anything_can_be_a_pr_broadening_your_horizons_to/?ref=share&ref_source=link), but the general take away here is there is no reason to push yourself against a plateau in a handful of areas. Take a step back, pick something else to focus on, go PR in that, then circle back around later and tackle your old goals when you are bigger and stronger. 

**Moving Forward**: 

>Moving forward I am going to cut for a while, then spend some time reading the 531 books and trying to vary my training a bit, with more periodization. Up until now I have picked a program and ran it for months-years, and its worked alright. But I've noticed that while my muscles are up to heavy singles right now, my joints and form is not really handling it as well as I could be, because I have been working with submaximal weight for about a year since the last time I really tried PRs. I hope to work more periods with high weight into my future training so I can keep things from getting rusty. These thoughts are more for my other lifts, as I am pretty much convinced that deadlifts will keep going up for me regardless of what I do. I am confident I will hit 800 in a year with 9 plates being the next stretch goal.

Well for one I never read those 531 books. I pretty much realized that I don’t like 531 and should not run it. It’s a great program, its just not for me. My “muscle were not up to heavy singles” because my programming then and for a good while after was dogshit, as I already discussed. I would go on to add a grand total of 10lbs onto my Bench/Squad/Deadlift total after this post over like a year and a half. I did hit that 800 a year after I planned, and here I am today with the 9 plates. I was right that deadlift would inevitably go up doing pretty much anything though. 

Moving forward now is a lot more vague. My training goals these days are lot more varied. I will hit 9 plate conventional pretty soon, I hope. From there I think I will try to pull 900 as a lifetime PR goal. I would love to hit it on a deadlift bar, but I plan to buy a 10ft Elephant style bar someday and if I cant get 900 on the deadlift bar I will do it with that instead. My barbell deadlift 1RM PR is now officially higher than my Trap Bar 1RM so maybe it’s time to revisit Trap Bar. Other than that I am just going to keep pulling whatever strikes my fancy and continue to try and become one of the best all around deadlifters/pullers ever. 

I hope that you got some value from my reflections here. I know that this is a lot less directly applicable to most people than most of my other posts, but I wrote this one just as much for me as I did for everyone else. Here’s hoping I can come back at some point and write about the road to 10 plates."

Disordered,"Research Review: Do Oral Contraceptives Affect Your Gains? • Stronger by Science  #Link to Article: [Do Oral Contraceptives Affect Your Gains?](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/oral-contraceptives/)

Our self-appointed BFFs at Stronger by Science have a new research review on the topic of contraceptives based on past learnings and [a recent study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33054662/).  The study examined the effects of oral contraceptives on strength gains, hypertrophy, and anabolic signaling.  Their article goes into a key question we see regularly: Do female lifters need to worry about hormonal contraceptives affecting their gains?

**tl;dr - ""If you choose to use hormonal contraceptives, you probably don’t need to worry about your gains.""**

Key points include

>* Strength gains and hypertrophy were not significantly different between groups. However, the subjects using oral contraceptives tended to have larger increases in lean body mass, along with some molecular indicators of anabolism.

>* When analyzing these results within the context of the rest of the literature, it doesn’t seem that second- or third-generation oral contraceptives have a meaningful effect on strength or hypertrophy outcomes.

Of note to me was the section calling out that any slight or potentially non-trivial edge is often less important than other reasons oral contraceptives are used.

>the research suggests that you probably don’t need to think about your gains when you’re deciding whether to start, stop, or change oral contraceptives.

plus

>	the most commonly discussed reasons for using or not using oral contraceptives (contraception, more control over your period, managing menstrual symptoms, etc.) seem like the most justifiable reasons

Also of note was that these studies and findings are largely based on oral contraceptives and do not include other methods like hormonal IUDs that have grown in popularity over the years.  More (hopefully!) to come.

>There are a lot of forms of hormonal contraception that haven’t yet been studied in a resistance training context. We don’t know how the minipill (progestin-only oral contraception), fourth-generation combination pills, hormonal IUDs, intravaginal inserts, or progestin injections affect strength and hypertrophy"

Disordered,"21M/6'/190lbs. Alright, Fitness community it has been about 8 months now. I just got a DEXA scan today. I'm going to give you guys a cr@p ton of data through text and images. Tell me what you think!  **Dexa and other images:** [https://imgur.com/a/JV59CZ7](https://imgur.com/a/JV59CZ7)

TL:DR

Over the past 8 months, I've lost about 40lbs of weight and 8% body fat. I'm proud of my progress but would like to start to lean bulk soon. However, I will do so only after I gain some non flexed ab visibility (or just some visibility period). It's a purely symbolic goal that means a lot to me and I'm going to achieve it however long it takes. Given everything I've shown, how much longer do you think I've got.

  
**Info**

I've been lifting on and off for about 6 years starting freshman year of high school in 2015. This is the longest consistent stretch though. I'm a 21-year-old 6' male that went from 225lbs to 190lbs and 23.9% to 14.7% body fat over 8 months. So about 8 months ago in August of last year, I finished up my bulk and was 225lbs. I then began cutting eating around 2500 calories a day from then until around mid-March when I started aggressively cutting eating around 2000 calories a day. I did this because I was tired of cutting and would like to start putting on some more size and lean bulking.

**Diet**  
I ate about 3 meals a day and usually snacked on a protein bar or a protein shake.  
An example of a day on MyFitnessPal can be seen here:

A log of what I ate for a month can be seen here:  
https://imgur.com/YUBEWzI   


Breakfast was usually something highly satiating that would last me until mid-afternoon around 3.   
Lunch would be something light that would hold me over till dinner.  
I usually ate my snack around 6PM this would satiate any hunger that came between lunch and dinner.  
Dinner would be something high in volume and dense with protein but still kinda low calorie. I like to eat, so something high in volume was necessary to keep this sustainable.

Supplements: Creatine, Pre-workout, Bodyfortress whey protein 

&#x200B;

**Workout Routine**  
I workout 3 days a week for a little over an hour using a PPL split. I try to increase the weight for each workout. I alternate the first workout on my push, pull, and leg days. First is either Bench, Deadlift, Squat or Overhead Press, Barbell Row, RDL.   


Here are some screenshots of some of my previous lifts

As for cardio, I'm a Mechanical engineering student at UT Austin. I get most of my cardio walking and biking around campus. In the fall I did boxing sessions for an hour or so every Saturday and shadowboxed every other day for about 20min. This Spring from Feb to mid-March I swam for an hour about twice a week. I've kinda fallen off that now thanks to midterms but thought I'd mention it anyway.  


As for sleep, I generally get about 5 hours of sleep a night usually going to bed around 2 AM. College life ;p.  
 https://imgur.com/4tEgReE 

&#x200B;

**Stats**  
I haven't been giving Overhead press or Row much love so I'm not going to list their numbers here as there hasn't been much growth.

Bench before bulk: 235 3x5  https://imgur.com/Y3JlSdE 

Bench now: 225 3x5  https://imgur.com/ThViTVg 

(I am trying to maintain 225 as I continue my cut. As of the past month, it's starting to get hard now. I usually choke on the last rep.)

Squat before bulk: 225 3x5  https://imgur.com/ukFB3pq 

Squat now: 295 3x5  https://imgur.com/gW113eB 

Deadlift before bulk: 225 3x5  https://imgur.com/lP3Ml5J 

Deadlift now: 350 3x5  https://imgur.com/y5k8X5m 

I've just been trying to maintain and build as much muscle mass as I can as I cut. Honestly, I feel like I can deadlift and squat more. I think it's just mental now.

I am now about 190lbs so about 40lbs of weight lost. According to my electronic scale, I was about 26.9% body fat in August though it was more likely 23% body fat. According to DEXA, I am about 14.7 percent body fat now and my scale currently reads me at 17.9% body fat. I'd like to believe the DEXA is more accurate than my scale, so my scale is off by about -3%.

  
**Conclusion**

So yeah that's about it. I'm pretty proud of my progress I think it's decent. Though as I mentioned before I would like to start to lean bulking soon. However, I will only do so after I gain some non flexed ab visibility. I know abs aren't all that it's just a purely symbolic goal for me. I've been fat all my life and would like to see some abs on my frame to prove to myself that I can do it. Purely symbolic but it means a lot to me.

So given all the DEXA and all the other data and factors, I've shown and told you, how much longer do you think I must cut to see some ab visibility? I'm in no hurry, I'm willing to go the distance. Just curious really.

&#x200B;

Any other comments on my progress you feel are worth sharing are appreciated as well.

Thanks!"

The latest research spotlight from Stronger by Science showcasing a new meta-analysis on the [interference effect](https://thefitness.wiki/faq/does-cardio-impair-muscle-gains/):

[Compatibility of Concurrent Aerobic and Strength Training for Skeletal Muscle Size and Function: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34757594/) by Schumann et al.

The review concluded that concurrent strength and endurance training does not compromise hypertrophy or strength gains. However, explosive strength gains may be attenuated.

The article briefly explains the results and then follows up with some real-world context.  It provides thoughts on the realities and concerns of balancing the training load of both endurance and resistance training.  I know a lot of people around here won't be surprised by these results, but it may be reassuring news to others.  

>Previously, the default assumption was that the interference effect generally mattered quite a bit, and that it was the goal of a coach to find the exact right mix of training variables to mitigate the interference effect to the greatest extent possible. However, I think the overall balance of evidence now suggests that the interference effect isn’t *that* big of a deal, and you probably don’t need to be *that* concerned about it most of the time."

I have a natural propensity to want to work out in the afternoon or early evening but I’d really love to get in the habit of working out in the morning.

Neutral,"Review & Results from 5 months of RP online coaching OR 'I paid for an online coach - you won't believe what happened next!'  **TLDR**

140 -> 130lbs and all lifts up.

[October 31 2021 - April 8 2022](https://imgur.com/a/IWE0wfB)

Online coaching is great.

&#x200B;

**Why Online Coaching?**

I live in Melbourne and we went through a lockdown of over 260 days.  Gyms were closed and I ate way too much with the misguided belief that I was 'bulking'.  All the while, I struggled to get enough intensity in my home workouts.  In short, a recipe for disaster.  So when the gyms re-opened, I decided to make a big change and what better motivation than getting a coach and putting my money on the line?

&#x200B;

**A little About Me**

I'm male, 34, about 5'4"" and currently sitting at 130lbs.  I've always had a fairly narrow frame and I if you could imagine a tall, handsome, naturally athletic person, and then think of everything that is the opposite, you'd have a fair image of me.  I work as a psychologist, so the gym is my way of offsetting all that carcinogenic sitting (sitting is the new smoking, as they say).

&#x200B;

**A Brief Training History**

I am the definition of a late bloomer.  After a lifetime of no physical activity, I started going to the gym in my 30s and worked with a PT for nine months, then cycled through 5/3/1, Reddit PPL, PHAT, and then RPs Physique Template.  Of course, all of this was brutally disrupted by the joys of COVID, so I'm still a bit of a beginner in the gym.

&#x200B;

**The Program - Weight Training**

I splurged and bought the combo plan (diet and weight training).  Since I was in my dreamer bulk, I started with a fat loss phase with a heavy focus on shoulders because I wanted to be able to lift heavy things overhead.

Each mesocycle in my program is about six weeks.  RP uses reps from failure to regulate intensity, or the number of reps left in the tank after completing a set.  The first week is a breeze, with just 2-3 sets per exercise and four reps from failure.  The intensity increases each week with added sets, increased weight, and closer proximity to failure, with week five being 4-5 sets per exericse, increased weight and only one rep from failure.  Generally, my week 1 workouts take about 30 minutes whereas week 5 takes 1.5-2 hours depending on my level of fatigue.

The program I'm on is  five full-body workouts a week, with a different focus on each day:

Day 1 - chest and shoulder focus

Day 2 - legs and shoulder focus

Day 3 - back and shoulder focus

Day 4 - legs and shoulder focus

Day 5 - full body

&#x200B;

An example of day 1, week 1:

Incline DB chest press | 2 sets | 30 lbs | goal reps 8-12 | 4/fail

Seated DB shoulder press | 2 sets | 27.5lbs | goal reps 8-12 | 4/fail

DB skull crushers | 3 sets | 15lbs | goal reps 10-20 | 4/fail

Straight bar cable curls | 2 sets | 33lbs | goal reps 10-20 | 4/fail

Bent over barbell row | 2 sets | 66lbs | goal reps 8-12 | 4/fail

DB walking lunge | 2 sets | 25lbs | goal reps 10-20 | 4/fail

&#x200B;

And then day 1 week 5:

Incline DB chest press | 5 sets | 35 lbs | goal reps 8-12 | 1/fail

Seated DB shoulder press | 5 sets | 30lbs | goal reps 8-12 | 1/fail

DB skull crushers | 5 sets | 20lbs | goal reps 10-20 | 1/fail

Straight bar cable curls | 5 sets | 43lbs | goal reps 10-20 | 1/fail

Bent over barbell row | 4 sets | 99lbs | goal reps 8-12 | 1/fail

DB walking lunge | 4 sets | 32.5lbs | goal reps 10-20 | 1/fail

&#x200B;

*Things I liked*

* The increase in intensity over the five weeks gave an amazing sense of progression
* It was easy to set goals for each exercise in each workout (one more rep than last week, or to try to match reps if the weight had increased)
* Using reps from failure ensured I didn't push too hard too early so I'd have a great peak week
* The program structure made it easy to hit PRs in week 5 which felt amazing

&#x200B;

*Things I didn't like so much*

* Sometimes the length of the workouts meant I only had enough time to complete 80% of the workout - this probably has occurred 5-6 times
* Reps from failure is a great system to regulate intensity but not easy to judge and takes a lot of practice, and it's easy to stuff it up
* The fatigue by week five is seriously a killer and made me not want to go to the gym some days

&#x200B;

**The Program - Nutrition**

The diet plan comes in the form of an excel diet template.  I'm now into my fifth template - four fat loss phases and one in maintenance.  I was given macro targets for each meal based on when I work out, as well as macro targets for rest days.  The template also includes calculators to help with meal prep and a list of recommended foods in the categories of lean proteins, healthy carbs, healthy fats, workout carbs, and veggies.

For reference, my macros:

* At the start of the fat loss phase - 140g protein / 170g carbs / 37.5g fats
* Final fat loss phase - 140g protein / 110g carbs / 15g fats
* Current maintenance - 140g protein / 150g carbs / 45g fats

&#x200B;

*Things I liked*

* Having a list of recommended foods made meal prep simpler
* The calculators were very handy for figuring out the amounts of different ingredients
* Having so much lean protein and veggies in most of my meals meant I was almost never hungry
* Eating more food than before and losing weight faster than before is amazing

&#x200B;

*Things I didn't like so much*

* Having the limited list of recommended foods got a little boring, particularly as my macros got reduced in subsequent templates
* You probably need some experience with calorie counting and RPs dieting principles, or you're in for a big adjustment
* Everything else was great.  This was easily the most sustainable and successful diet I've tried and I feel like I could keep this going for a very, very long time

&#x200B;

**The Coaching**

All the comms with my coach was via email.  At the start, we helpfully spent quite a bit of time figuring out goals.  I get three check-in emails a week where I log my basic stats (weight, diet adherence, and fatigue), as well as regular check-ins if there are any changes or when my program is updated.  My coach always responds within 24-hours and I was encouraged to send videos for feedback on my form.

&#x200B;

*Things I liked*

* Fast response times to all my questions
* Having someone to go to when I had uncertainty about my training was helpful for sticking it out
* I got helpful advice when I wasn't sure how to handle a situation, such as when I got sick, or how to manage my diet on a weekend away
* The check-ins helped a lot with my adherence to the program
* The video form checks were great.  I have a history of pain when doing lat pulldowns and with a few video form checks I have a smoother movement and I'm lifting heavier and pain free

&#x200B;

*Things I didn't like so much*

* Communication via email isn't always easy and some questions required quite a bit of back and forth

&#x200B;

**The Results**

I guess this is what really matters!  I've listed my main lifts except for overhead press, as the first mesocycle had db shoulder press and the final was barbell shoulder press.  As an alternative, I've listed my progress on db lateral raises.  Also my results would probably be slightly better except I ran a 14.8k fun run with no training and had to take a few days off, and then came down with a cold during peak week... genius stuff!

* My lifts went up quite a bit even though I was cutting for almost the entire four months
* I lost quite a bit of fat and seem to have gained a little muscle along the way

&#x200B;

*Things I didn't like so much*

* Changing the lifts was enjoyable but obviously makes it harder to compare and track progression

**Final Thoughts - was it worth it?**

Yes.  Absolutely worth it.  I've been spending hundreds of dollars on my gym membership over the years without a lot of success.  In other words, throwing money and time down the drain.  I'm looking this as an investment that's making going to the gym worthwhile for achieving my goals.

Having an online coach has helped a lot with adherence and motivation, and I've managed a streak of five months of workouts five times a week.  I learned how lose fat more easily and with less hunger, I learned how to push myself harder in the gym, and I finally had the experience of success in changing my body composition.

I intend to keep working with my coach for at least another six months as we head into a bulk, and I am beyond excited.  I hope that if you've ever wondered about online coaching or RP that this has been in some way helpful.  And if you're thinking about it... I'd recommend taking the plunge!"

Disordered,"UPDATE: My one year journey from not-underweight to healthy (25M; 5'7"" / 130lb -> 153lb; mid March '21 to mid March' 22)  **Disclaimer**: please don't kill me for the title! I'm just poking a little fun at my last post lol. Anyways, here's this to start:

Previous post link: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/pw2ged/my_six_month_journey_from_very_underweight_to/)

As for now, it's feels pretty much the same lol. My routine is basically the same with some tweaks and additions. The main differences in the past few months are a job position change, which has caused a diet change because of the new hours I've been working. I've also worked through a variety of injuries, which I've learned quite a bit about, which I'll include in a separate notes section down below. Also, for my updated routine, I included a LOT more detail this time, which is going to make it seem super long, so bear with me.

So yeah, there's that. I usually do this six days a week, barring any outside circumstances. 

As for my diet, same as the last post. I'm eating typically the same things every day, but they're different from what they were before. The list in the included screenshot is a lot, and that's what I'd ideally eat every day, but there are days where I miss certain items. Either way, I try to make sure what I eat is at least over 3000 calories at the bare minimum. I also reduced the amount of protein I was eating (which in the last post was wayyyy overboard), reduced the amount of sodium, and added more carbs instead. Everything is listed in the screenshots below.

[New Diet](https://imgur.com/a/np3tf3e) 

Other things to include:  
- Since the last post, I've used pre-workout before every time I've gone to the gym. I personally use Pre-Jym, but I may switch since I'm getting a little sick of it, it's a little sugary, it's a massive scoop, and I have to drink quite a bit of water because of the scoop size. We'll see.  
- Since the last post, I've used creatine after every workout, even on my off days. I tried to remember to take it even during extended periods of days where I didn't go to the gym, but sometimes it wasn't possible. See below.  
- I battled quite a few injuries and I learned a lot from it. These include: elbow tendonitis, bicep tendonitis, and multiple pulled back muscles. This, coupled with covid for a week, set me back about a cumulative total of a month of lost gym days.  
- Hot damn, my leg days and weights skyrocketed these past six months out of nowhere.  
- I did hit 225 on my bench on the session after I decided to cut off this post, so it's not included in the weight above because I felt like it would be cheating (lol), but I did do it!

Main things I've learned:  
- Accessory workouts are HUGELY important for ""forgotten"" muscle groups, especially when you get to higher weights. Some of the injuries that I had weren't do to overuse, but rather, overload.  
- Elbow tendonitis: I had both golfer's and tennis elbow at both the same and different times on my left arm. It would hurt to bench sometimes, on lat pulldowns, face pulls, etc. Turns out it was two things. 1) Gripping with my fingertips too much and not in the main part of my hand. 2) My forearms and area surrounding my elbow wasn't strong enough to support the loads I was lifting. I had to essentially rehab and strengthen that area of my arms to fix and prevent injury. Some of the rehab work I did at home while relaxing, and I was able to ease thru workouts still to some degree without losing days.  
- Bicep tendonitis: this one was harder to figure out. It would hurt while benching at times, while overhead pressing, lat pulldowns, and would even hurt just to pick up weights it got so bad. Turns out it was because I wasn't working out my rotator cuffs at all. I won't break down the full explanation, because I'm not a doctor or physical therapist, but once I started to add rotator cuff exercises in and really focus on them, it slowly went away. I started that rehab at home as well, so I could slowly still go to the gym without missing days.  
- Back injuries: I don't even know what caused the first one, but it wasn't at the gym. That one was the worst pain of my life, and I kept going to the gym thru it. Eventually it got to the point I could barely breath and had to go to urgent care twice. The second one somehow popped in the middle of one rep on a squat set. I worked out thru that one too and had it for a little over a month until about a few weeks ago. I'm stubborn. Don't be like me. With the back ones, I learned to just take the week off and let it fully heal. Yeah, sure, I didn't miss days because I worked thru it. But the workouts did get painful and that got annoying. I'd rather just take the week off and not have to feel pain doing every workout, every day at this point.

Things I'm working on:  
- DEADLIFTS. I still didn't do it (lol). Now that my back is better, I'm going to start now.
- My next goal is to join the 1000 club. I did hit 225 on the bench between my cutoff date for this post and the actual day this got posted. I'm sure I can do one rep of 315 while squatting too. The only thing I'd have left, which is now why I have to start it, is the deadlift (lol). I know I can at least do one rep of 195 decently easily, since there have been times where I'm forced to deadlift it off the ground to start sets of barbell rows when I don't have a rack.  
- Lowkey, at this point, I kind of want to leg press 1000 pounds for reps now... 

Things holding me back:  
- Weight gain. Mannn, I try to eat well over 3000 calories in a day. It's been like a month since I've gained even 3 solid, non-fluctuating pounds. I've gotten stronger still, but no weight gains. I don't know why.  I mean, I do, but I don't.  
- My job has been active the whole time I've been working out. To estimate, I used to walk at least 20k steps a day. Now, I probably walk at least 16k steps a day and am lifting and moving boxes and stuff around often. This plays into the above bullet point. Can't really change that, but can I even stomach eating more than I do in a day? Ehhhh... 

But yeah, ultimately that's my full year progress, journey, and guide to where I'm at now. I'm open to suggestions on any aspect of what I've done so far, whether it be focus exercises or dietary changes, so please let me know! I'm not sure if I'll post or update on this again, as I feel pretty content with the year mark. Plus, I'm pretty lazy and it took me a hot minute, spread over days, to even make this post. But again, thank you all very much and good luck on your journeys!"

Hello /r/fitness! I am on the journey of losing weight/becoming healthier. I am primarily trying to lose the fat/build some strength(I know it will be harder to build big muscles on a deficit, so I'm mainly just going for strength gains). I plan on trying a modified version of 5/3/1 while also mixing in about 1-2 hours of cardio every week.

A deficit for me with 4-5 days of exercise is about 2400 cal. I plan on prepping for 6 days a week. Saturday will be a sorta cheat day (eat whatever I want but still try to stay within 2400 cal). So here is the plan I came up with.

[Meal Plan](https://imgur.com/a/bqgGiqw) (the garlic and spinach will be thrown into lunch and dinner, I just didn't count them as they have such few calories)

I am a picky eater so I know it's a little basic. I know there are some really good foods like avocados, but I absolutely hate them.

I have an office job and use a standing desk, walk about 2 miles every day and will start adding in cycling most mornings when the weather is nice, 3 miles round trip. 

My biggest question is for my goal of weight loss, while retaining muscle, do these macros make sense? 

I'm tracking via Carbon and it puts my daily calories at 1788 with macros at:

Protein: 166g
Carbs: 155g
Fat: 56g

My stats are
Male
Mid 30s
5' 9""
206lbs
~26% body fat 

I feel pretty satiated at this deficit and while I don't feel I'm getting stronger in the gym, I don't feel like I'm getting weaker. 

Do these numbers make sense for my activity level and goal of losing 15 lbs before moving into a surplus for muscle building?

Neutral,"LSD microdose as preworkout  In my experience LSD 10 - 15ug (1/10 of the standard street dose) is almost the perfect preworkout.

-

Edit - This is not a recommendation that anyone tries microdosing as a pre workout! These are simply the effects I observed. Don’t follow in my footsteps, I’m a dumbass.

-

LSD is nontoxic and nonaddictive, but can be dangerous for those with mental disorders like schizophrenia. If you struggle with your hold on reality then please avoid psychedelics and psychotropic drugs in general (including peds). I would also avoid it if you have a substance use disorder as like all drugs it *can* be abused.

Below is my list of all the performance related effects of microdosing lsd. 


Effects -

Increased energy - 
The increased energy is potent but never feels forced and one can sit still if need be but one feels encouraged to move. This is comparable to a average dose of caffeine and lasts approx 8 hours.

Appetite suppression - 
This effect is far stronger then what is provided by caffeine and can rival a low dose of amphetamine (this also lasts around 8 hours so it’s perfect for a fast). Eating big meals can become impossible and small meals of fruits and oats are preferred.

Wakefulness aid - 
This effect is more then just the increased energy mentioned above. Most people will find it *impossible* to sleep within 8-12 hours after LSD, even at a microdose. This effect is most comparable to 150mg of modafinil. 

Increased strength -
I always find that I can lift more / perform more reps after a microdose. It’s almost like my mental limiter has been removed. This effect is most pronounced within the first 4-6 hours of the experience.

Euphoria -
LSD can be very euphoric. The effect is not as potent at a microdose level, but it boosts the post workout euphoria by a huge margin.

Decreased boredom and increased music appreciation-
Honestly I could workout all day after a microdose and never get bored. You feel very creative and in the moment and music sounds absolutely amazing, this is even more the case after the endorphins start pumping.

Increased coordination -
As a fairly athletic person, I play a lot of spots with my main being skateboarding. I have filmed and landed most of my best tricks after a microdose. It’s almost like my body movement is more precise and my coordination skills / self confidence is off the charts.

Down sides - 
Biggest downsides to me are appetite suppression while bulking and the instant tolerance. LSD can only be microdosed 1 to 2 times a week (every 4 days), otherwise the positive effects begin to fade. If you have over used it a built up a high tolerance then a 2 week long brake will reduce your tolerance back to baseline.

People who suffer from anxiety may also want to avoid psychedelics. Psychedelics  often cause and increase anxiety in people who are prone to it, I personally experience this and avoid it if my anxiety levels are higher then normal on that day / week.


Please share any experiences / effects you may have had with microdosing and working out.

Edit 2 - This is not a April’s fools post, just bad timing. I’m interested in pharmacology and try to discuss substance use in a prejudice free manner.

A microdose should have little to no subjective effects. These doses don’t cause hallucinations, mania or sensory effects."

So I recently got a body scan done, and I was going over the results and im not sure if I'm just kinda slow, but why is my Dry Lean Mass (43lb) lower than my Skeletal Muscle Mass (92lb)? From what I've read, the Dry Lean Mass measure muscle mass that you have on your body and the Skeletal Muscle Mass is the muscles you control voluntarily and can build. Is the reason my SMM is higher than my DLM because the machines measures the SMM with the water inside the muscles, whereas the DLM is without water?

It's the first time I've ever done one of these tests and just want to make sure I understand everything right.

Ive been doing an Upper Lower 4 day split and have been following Mike israetrel’s guidelines for volume. Here’s the problem:

The minimum effective volume for an upper day would involve 22 sets per workout. 

That’s absolute bare minimum. According to his research, most people past beginner will need more. So if we just add 1 more set for each body part, now we’re at 29 sets in a workout. Most people I’ve found would call “doing 29 sets” overtraining. But according to what limited research I can find, it’s literally the bare minimum.

So I've scoured the rules, including the entire list of banned topics in Rule 2, and I *think* I'm in the clear here. Whether or not this is the right place to be asking this question's another thing entirely, but I'm hoping I can get some help here.   
I'm a scraggly writer. Furthermore, I'm a scraggly writer who can't work out due to a disability. The relevance here is that I have a character who's got a bodybuilder physique, and I'm trying to get a sense of how much he'd weigh. The complicated part is that he's seven and a half feet tall (and this is sounding dumber the further I go, but press on I shall.) I looked at over-simplistic weight charts and calculators and tried to extrapolate to someone his size, but it tends to break down.   
After that, I found the heights and weights of different bodybuilders and likely-phony instagram fitness gurus who looked like they had the same general shape as him, and I got an average of the ratios of their height in cm to their weight in kg. I tried applying it to my guy, but it seems inaccurate to me too. He's seven and a half feet tall, but using this method, he'd only weigh 250 pound, which sounds to my inexperienced ears like a huge undershoot. So here's me asking for more experienced opinions. Based on your actual experiences -as opposed to my frantic, pointless Googling- how heavy should this guy be? (For reference, some of the builds I used for my calculations were Ali Bilal, Ryan J. Terry, and Anton Antipov. I know they're probably completely un-serious instagrammers, but they looked about right, so I went with it.)

I recently just started up the gym after a 2~3 year hiatus. Decided to chat with one of the employees about possibly getting a personal trainer. 

He did [this](https://i.imgur.com/1l4CFOj.jpg) body analysis thing on me that showed my segmental lean analysis and showed that my right leg had .8% more muscle mass than my left leg and suggested a few months of therapy for it with a personal trainer because anything above .3% was significant. My arm difference was .1% so it wasn’t a big deal.  

I know imbalances causing back problems or potential injuries are a real thing, but my back now feels fine. My right leg/arm has felt more dominant since I started working out in high school over 10 years ago, and from what I remember my right leg was stronger during certain leg workouts and held more during weighted leg workouts, which i remember getting weird lower back pain during those. 

So my main question is should I just do unilateral leg workouts for awhile to gain equal strength in my legs? Or should I actually pay a personal trainer to help me out? Id rather save the money because it’s a little too expensive for me right now to pay for a trainer and motivation is not the issue.

Neutral,"Machines and Freeweights  I'm sure this is a common question, but I've got other questions to add to it:

Soon, I'll be at a place where the only option might be machines without any free weights. I'm wondering the timeless question: Are machines good enough? Alright, now I'm asking from the perspective of health. I have gotten conflicting responses. What I've heard and read is that, if you do machines-only, you won't be training your stabilizers and could get injured as a result and generally have bad balance. So, anyone got answers that can be backed up? 

The second question is this (I think it adds a lot more to the original): if I do calisthenics along with machines, will that strengthen stabilizers enough? 

My goal is to be firstly healthy, secondly strong, and thirdly I am concerned with anesthetics.  My main concern is health with strength; I'm less worried about looks, but those are a big bonus, of course. I used to lift a lot, but have been on a long hiatus. I'm getting back into it. I train for functionality. I'll be getting back into MMA, as well, so I'm less concerned with anesthetics and more concerned with health and functionality. Aeathetics are a welcome bonus, though, of course.

EDIT: I guess what I'm afraid of is getting strong in an unhealthy way. Like have strong groups of isolated muscles, but not the rest of my body. Then I'd be both less functional and less healthy. For example: let's say we put a v8 into a Honda Civic and then tune it up for max HP and torque. But we don't also get good tires and don't tune gearing at all... so all you wind up doing is spinning out or losing control. It isn't a perfect example, but it conveys my thoughts decently. Big and strong, but not balanced,  not stable, and not functional

Disordered,"Muscle Maintenance during Stress, Detraining, and Sickness  **Much of the discussion in fitness forums is based around achieving hypertrophy. One might think that to maintain muscle they are better off following hypertrophy-centric advice, but this is not always effective. Poor access to food, gyms, stress, life events, etc can make rigorous programs difficult to follow at all times. In understanding the minimum effort you can put in to maintain your muscle mass, you make yourself much more adaptable in pressing times.**

**There is a great security in knowing that you won't lose your progress should you need to focus on more important matters for some time.**

**This post will go over maintaining muscle in various contexts, both emotional and physical. Sources are included with the statistics themselves, I encourage anyone to look into sources for things they will apply to themselves.**

# Key concepts

**- The amount of protein you need to consume for nitrogen balance (net lean-mass maintenance) is dependent on your level of training, calories, and other macronutrients.**

**-** [**Carbohydrates spare protein needs more than fats**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/440521)**, but they cannot** [**alone induce nitrogen balance.**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7598072/)

**- Training one muscle will reduce the catabolism of other muscles by altering your endocrine environment (**[**mainly through IGF1, not testosterone**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24276305/)**), but this effect is not capable of completely protecting untrained muscles.**

# 1. Detraining/Unable to go to the gym

**In 75 year old men,** [**3 sets of 10 reps at 80% max was sufficient to maintain muscle mass in the targetted muscle over 12 weeks.**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11909878/)

**Keep in mind that these are 75-year-old men who ate maintenance calories, muscle-sparing in younger people is likely even more forgiving.**

# 2. At-home sickness (COVID, Flu, etc)

**Viral infections cause muscle wasting through activation of IL-6, an inflammatory cytokine. Check with your doctor if reducing inflammation is in your best interest, as they will know best based on your condition. If you are given the go-ahead on reducing inflammation, OTC aspirin and fish oil can help reduce levels of IL6 and muscle wasting.**

**UNLESS PRESCRIBED BY DOCTOR, DO NOT USE CORTICOSTEROIDS,** [**THEY CAUSE MUSCLE WASTING**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557731/)**.**

**As for training, calisthenics and makeshift dumbells are your best bet. Use exercises that do not hit too many muscles, as this will minimize cardiovascular load which might be strained during an infection. If you feel able to do compound calisthenics though, by all means, go ahead.**

**Diamond pushups, curls with makeshift dumbells, dynamic planks, leg raises, incline to calve raises, pull-ups (if able), lateral raises, and oblique planks can all be used to preserve muscle mass in all parts of the body.**

# 3. Bedridden

**Talk with your doctor to see if you're able to do some mild resistance training while in bed. If your limbs have been immobilized,** [**your muscles will begin to waste after around 1 week**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4600281/)**. Ensure that your food is high in protein and that you are eating maintenance calories.**

# 4. High stress

**Cortisol, the primary stress hormone, promotes muscle protein breakdown and suppresses the immune system. Training and maintenance calories (and slight surplus) are two physical strategies to reduce cortisol. Carbohydrates may also help reduce cortisol,** [**but this effect is more pronounced at lower BF%**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893582/#:~:text=A%20diet%20high%20in%20carbohydrate,to%20prolonged%20exercise%20%5B64%5D)**. Practice stress-reduction techniques to reduce the cortisol increase caused by your emotional state.**

[**High cortisol puts you at risk for an infection**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465119/#:~:text=Cortisol%20is%20ordinarily%20anti%2Dinflammatory,the%20immune%20response%20%5B18%5D)**, and thus even more muscle wasting.**

**Furthermore, although exercise increases cortisol, it does so alongside the** [**release/upregulation of other anti-catabolic hormones**](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/exercise-and-stress/art-20044469)**, and provides stress relief on its own. Cortisol in the absence of these coincident hormones is the real killer of lean mass.**

# 5. Sickness/Low appetite/Very Low calories

**During sickness, one may feel overwhelmingly satiated despite consuming very little food. This is likely due to the** [**appetite-blunting effects of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10657519/)**. Do not be fooled, however, muscle** [**protein breakdown is greatly increased during times of high inflammatory burden.**](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/132/7/1921/4687380)

**Carbohydrates and fats as well as caloric surplus can lower your protein need. If you are unable to stomach enough carbohydrates and fats to meet your maintenance, you need to up your protein intake. Your body will require much more protein to maintain nitrogen balance.**

**Experiments on subjects undergoing protein sparing modified fasting (PSMF), a diet consisting solely of 500-800 calories of lean protein, have demonstrated that muscle mass can be protected in times of severe caloric restriction by upping protein intake to** [**125-200g per day.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4784653/)

**Try your hardest to eat at least 2.2g/kg protein. You do not need to eat beyond this but it is important that you reach this to avoid muscle wasting.**

# 6. Sleep deprivation

[**Even acute sleep deprivation is capable of reducing muscle protein synthesis.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7785053/#:~:text=Acute%20sleep%20deprivation%20decreases%20muscle,promotes%20a%20catabolic%20hormonal%20environment) **Though you may not want to rely on supplements and medication to sleep, it might be important to use such ailments to reset the circadian rhythm and prevent muscle wasting.** [**Melatonin seems effective in resetting the circadian clock**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3696986/)**, even if its ability to induce sleep is debated.**

# Takeaway

**Maintaining muscle during simple detraining is surprisingly easy at maintenance calories. During infection and immobilization, though, it is important to meet your heightened protein needs BEFORE attempting to eat at maintenance calories. Using stress-reduction techniques can also make it easier to maintain muscle during pressing times.**

This leads me to my question, if the Dumbbell Bench Press is a preferred exercise for hypertrophy for the chest, is there an alternative that is suggested in place of the Barbell Row? I also wanted to see if there are any reasons why I should train Barbell Bench Press instead of Dumbbell Bench Press.

Neutral,"Clarification on the 8-12-8 method for a noob  Edit: This is the 8-12-8 method by Paul Carter. I think I may have wrongly assumed it to be more popular or well known than it is

Hi,

Apologies in advance if any of these are stupid questions; I've never really followed a routine before and I workout from home with limited equipment due to mental health issues so I'm not really sure on best practices etc.

I decided to do a little bit of research today as I keep hitting a limit with the current exercise routine.

I have a classic ""skinny-fat"" physique with fat around my waist / stomach etc. Everywhere else I look skinny and my muscles are particularly long / thin.

I had been training more for strength by trying to do 3 sets of 6 X 6, and when I could do 6x6 for all 3 sets I'd put the starting weight up and continue again until I could hit the 3 X 6 X 6.

I found that with this I was able to reach a certain point but it wasn't particularly helping me gain visible muscle and I would always end up hitting a wall which I could not pass.

My diet isn't optimal either which I need to sort but I'd like to understand the fundamentals of 8-12-8 to start with but I'm unsure of the following:

1) Should I be picking a weight that I know I can do 3 sets of 8 reps, or should I be picking a weight where I know for the first set at least I can reach 8? I'm guessing it's the former but I'd like to double check.

2) Should I be aiming for 12, 8, 8 or 12, 12, 12 before moving up?

2) If 12, 8, 8 is the pattern to aim for, should I still be applying almost to failure for sets 2 and 3 if I feel I have an extra rep in the tank? If I did this on set 2 for example this could jeopardize reaching 8 reps on set 3 so I'm guessing this is a bad idea

E.g. today I picked 70KG on bench press as I was confident I could maybe hit 12 on the first set, but was unsure of the subsequent 2 sets of 8.

I did the following: 70x12, 70x8, 70x6, 70x6 (aiming for 3 sets but did 4 as couldn't reach 8 reps).

I guess I'm unsure of what to do in this kind of scenario; if I can barely reach 8 in set 2, there's little chance I'll reach it in set 3. This was evident in the rest of my routine too.

Should I be lowering the weight next week to aim for 12, 8, 8, or should I raise it even knowing that I'll unlikely hit 8 reps again for each set?

My guess is that I should be picking a weight that I am confident that I can do 3x8 or 12,8,8 and only exerting maximum effort on set 1 and bumping the weight down if I can't reach the target?

I'd appreciate any advice on how to proceed

Cheers!"

I’ve been one of those people that goes to the gym consistently for 6 months, drops off for 6 more, and then starts again for the last several years.  One thing I’ve consistently found is I get extremely sore for extended periods of time.  I’m talking I do 4 sets x 8 reps of squats struggling for the last rep and I’m sore for 10 days.  I try moderate activity (walking) and foam rolling and it doesn’t help much.  

Is this a sign I have such minimal muscle that I just need to keep at it, or should I be concerned?"
Disordered,"From 0 Pull Ups to One Arm Chin Up in 1000 Days | A Detailed Progress Post about My Pull Up Transformation  This is going to be a detailed and comprehensive post about my vertical pulling strength progression, from not being able to do a single Pull Up, to a clean One Arm Chin Up on Gymnastics Rings on both arms, putting on about 35lbs of weight along the way. I will write about the beginning, types of routines I used, DIY equipments, training experience etc. This post will be long, so I will include an index in the beginning and make headers for each chapter so that it is easy to read and navigate through this post.

#• Starting from Zero (4-5 months):

I started training on 23rd May, 2019, at the age of 17. At 170cm height, my weight was 44kg/97lbs. This was pretty low. I will not get into why because that's not the goal of this post. Anyway, I did not have any prior experience with strength training. I could neither do a push up or a pull up. I was so weak, that after doing a couple of negative pull ups (not even slow ones), I could not bend or fully straighten my arms for the next 4-5 days because of intense soreness. Around this time I had zero knowledge about training and I watched a lot of YouTube videos to get some ideas about what to do. You will see in the video that I used to do pull ups on my gate and rows on a broomstick, I will write more about them in the equipments section. But for the first few months, my pull up training consisted of negative pull ups (trying to go as slow as I could) and bodyweight rows, which I could only do about 6-8 reps of. I did not have a proper routine and did not know where to find one. So I just did whatever seemed logical to me after watching YT videos on this subject. 

It took me about 3-4 months to get a clean pull up and about 5-6 months to get 5.

#• The Next Phase & a New Routine (next 5-6 months)

So after about 5-6 months I found an app on Play Store called Calisthenics ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.londonsoftware.calisthenics.calisthenics ). The beginner routine was free so I started using it. Looking back, I would not call it the best thing, but it was better than what I used to do and a lot of trash routines you can find online. I followed this for the next 5-6 months. The main methods of progressive overload of this routine were increasing reps and progressively decreasing the band tension (this had a lot of band assisted pull ups). It also had a lot of isometric holds in different parts of the pull up. These were really helpful. As it got me to 10-12 pull ups in a row. But after that there was a problem. 

See the app was great for mid to low rep ranges as it's easier to go from 5-5-5 pull ups to 6-6-5 pulls on the next session than let's say 13-13-13 to 14-14-13. I do not remember the exact progression of the routine but it was similar to this. So after a certain point (10-12 pull ups), I was stuck. This routine goes up to like 19-18-18 (which I can't do even now) and after completing the whole beginner program, you should be able to do 20 pull ups in a row. But progress doesn't happen like that. I was stuck and stayed stuck in that 10-12 rep range for a long time and was not able to progress after that point. So after like 6-7 months, I decided to stop the routine and follow something of my own.

#• Equipments: 

Before I write about my routine afterwards, it's important to talk about the equipments I used. As it will be important as I introduce weighted pull ups and use different and harder progressions.

So I have never gone to a gym. In home there was no pull up bar. I first did negatives on a door ledge thing (don't know what to call that in English, but in the video I'm doing negative pull ups there). But this hurt my fingers too much. So I started doing it on the iron collapsible gate. The edge was pretty sharp so I warped 2 dirty towels around it so that it won't cut my hands. This [looked something like this.](https://i.imgur.com/7tv6MTt.jpg) This is where I did all my pull ups until I bought Rings in May 2020. I have also trained outside in a park near me. I used a broomstick and two chairs to do rows in the beginning. But it was not very stable so after a while I stopped it.

For extra weight, in the beginning I used a school bag. I had two 2.5kg/5lbs dumbbells and I picked up some bricks from the road and put it in the bag. The weight was 15kg/33lbs total (weighed using a bathroom scale). In 2021 August, I bought four 5kg/11lbs plates from amazon and a weight belt. I used five 1L bottles for microloading. Combining the bag and the plates + bottles, I could get any weight from 1kg-40kg. I used the bag to do one arm bicep curls as well. However I'm sad to say that the straps of the bag broke just few days ago while doing some weighted push ups. So I can only go upto 25kg/55lbs now, not 40kg like before. 

I have a medium resistance band. It is broken but it works. The first band I had was the light red resistance tube, which broke after a year.

Gymnastics Rings were the best investment I ever made. I hung the Rings on the gate itself (or on the bar if I was outside). The Rings were truly the game changer. I recommend buying one to everyone, even if you're not heavily into Calisthenics. Now back to the progress report.

#• Fuckaroundities (next 9-10 months):

After I was done with the app, I started following my own routine. And this was the first time I was doing weighted pull ups. I started with 5kg. The routine was very simplistics and the biggest problem was I did not have a clear idea how to progress week to week. However, being new to weighted pull ups, I did make some progress in the beginning. I went up to +15kgx3 (I only had 15kg at that time). From October-November 2020, I started going to a park at very early morning and started doing unilateral movements.

I could not carry 15kg to the park, I tried harder progressions instead. And [Mantle Chin Up](https://youtu.be/f2BM5hdX8dI) was the first progression I used. It's a very good progression. Many people who have some basic strength in pull ups want to know how to get started with one arm pull up training, and Mantle Chin/Pull Up is the answer. It won't get you to a full one arm pull up, but this will get you far. This was my main movement till about March 2021. After which I started training at home again the 2nd wave of covid hit my place. From March to August, I did a lot of fuckaroundities with different progressions and stuffs and didn't make a whole lot of progress. Then came a big change.

#• Riding the Gainz Train with APRE (next 5-6 months):

During all this time I was learning about training from different places. I spent a lot of time on Reddit, forums and websites, watching YouTube videos etc. I was also learning more about weight training theories and different programs and variables, and how they can be applied to my training. While doing this, I found the APRE mode of progression through Mathew Zlat. This was very interesting and I decided to apply it.

APRE is Autoregulating Progressive Resistance Exercise. There can be different programs based on it, this is the one I used for my weighted Ring Chin Up and weighted Ring Dip. This can be applied to any exercise.

You start with a weight you can do for 10-12 reps. You do that for 8-10 rep range. First two sets would be 8 reps (even if you can do more which you should be able to in the beginning, don't. Keep the reps in reserve). The last set you go to failure. You do it 3 times a week, and add weight every session based on how many reps you did in the last set of the last session. 

So if you do 8-8-10, you add 2.5kg/5lbs, if you do 8-8-9 then add 1.5kg/3.5lbs, if you do 8-8-8 then add 0.5kg/1lbs. If fail to do 8 reps on any set, then don't add any weight the next session. If you fail to add any weight 3 sessions in a row, do a deload and move down the rep range. 

Do the same thing with 5-8 rep range, start with the weight you ended doing your 8-10 range with. If you do 8 reps last set, add 5kg/11lbs next session. For 7, 6 and 5 reps, add weight like the last rep range (2.5kg, 1.5kg, 0.5kg). This is the range where you will make the most amount of progress. When you fail to add weight 3 sessions in a row, deload and move down again.

This time do the same thing with 3-5 range. Make the rest time slightly longer as the intensity is higher. When you can't add weight 3 sessions in a row, rest 3 days and try a one rep max. You should be a lot stronger than you used to be when you started at the 8-10 range.

This is what I used to do the program. Bought 20kg/45lbs total weight plates and used 1L and 500ML water bottles to microload and also had that 15kg bag fro before. Let's say I I need to do 28.5kg chin ups for the 5-8 range. I would have the plates (20kg) between my legs, two 2.5kg dumbbells in the bag (5kg), three 1L full bottles and one 500ML full bottle on the bag (3.5kg) and that's how I would get 28.5kg.

One of the biggest benefits of this program is the psychological one in my opinion. Because you are adding weight every session, you are basically hitting pr every session, 3 times a week. Even it's as small as 1lbs. This is very rewarding. As this is a very high frequency program, it may not work with squats and and deadlifts. But weighted pull ups/dips have excellent stimulus to fatigue ratio, so it can work. It can also work with OHP I think. Not sure about bench press. If you are not very strong, I highly highly recommend doing this program (maybe change it to 2 sessions a week rather than 3). Start from 8-10 and end at 3-5. This whole cycle should take from 6-9 months (nice). 

This got me to a 38kg weighted ring chin up (over 60% of my bw) from one rep max of 27.5kg on a bar and 3x40kg weighted ring dip (max weight I had) from 3x15kg. Then I specifically started training for the one arm chin up, from January 2022.

#• Fantastic Programs and Where to Find Them (last few months):

This is the last phase. During this time I had a pretty good idea how my body responds to different things. I tried a very unique method this time for the one arm chin up. The Concentric-Eccentric Method.

This idea was taken from Dominik Sky. Basically it is when you train the concentric and eccentric part of the movement separately. For the concentric day, you only focus on powerful concentric part of the movement. You can use a box so you don't have to do the eccentric part. Getting up as fast and powerfully you can is the goal. On the eccentric day it's the opposite. Only focus on supramaximal (something you can't do a concentric of, so higher than your one rep max) slow eccentrics. The minimum time you should spend to get down should be 6s and the ideal time should be 8-10s. I see some people do 2-3 seconds negative, I don't think it's very efficient. Does this method have any value? Is it better than traditional training? Is it sustainable? I don't know. I can just say that it worked very well with me.

I used a pulley system to do the concentric. So put one strap of a ring through a 5kg plate or a small bag with weight in it, put the strap through the ring you are not using to do the chin up and hold that strap for assistance. This way the progress is measurable and I can only get as much resistance as the counter weight allows me to. I would progressivly reduce the counter weight to make it harder. I would pull as fast as I could and would skip the eccentric. And for the eccentric day, I would jump up and do a slow one arm negative and will add weight to that progressively to make it harder. I also focused on my grip strength and bicep curls during this phase. Here's how the sessions looked like. I only did this for the OAC, not for weighted dips.

● Session 1, Monday (Concentric)

A. Pulley Assisted OAC - 2 sets of 1 (with the least counter weight), 2 sets of 2 (slightly more counter weight) - 1 set of 3 (with the most counter weight) - 5-6 min rest

B. Weighted Paused Ring Pull Ups (normal pull ups, no skipping eccentrics) - 4 sets of 5 - 3 min rest

C. One Arm Schoolbag Curl - 3-4 sets of 5 - 2 min rest (after both arms)

D. Weighted One Arm Hang - 3 sets of 10-20s - 2 min rest

● Session 2, Friday (Eccentric)

A. One Arm Chin Up Negative (with weight if possible) - 2 sets of 1 rep lasting 6-8s, 3 sets of 1 rep lasting about 10s - 6-7 min rest.

B, C, D exactly same as Monday. Only the first movement would be different. 

Here is the progression scheme. I would try to reduce 0.5kg from the counter weight every week (I used water bottles in a bag to do this) and add 0.5kg on the negative. I started with 5kg/11lbs as the counter weight and ended with an empty bottle (basically nothing). For the negatives I started with just bodyweight and ended with 7.5kg/16lbs added weight for a slow 8s negative. My best grip feat was one arm hang with 20kg/45lbs extra for 20s.

#• Conclusion:

And this is how, on 7th March, 2022, after 1019 days, I achieved a full One Arm Chin Up on both arms starting from zero. My weight is 60kg/ 130m2lbs. Pretty low, but way more than what it used to be. Let me know if you have any specific question.

Disordered,"Cardio for lifters (and anyone else who hates cardio)  Hey folks! I'm here to spread the Good News about cardio for lifters. TL;DR - it won't kill your gains, it *will* improve your work capacity and your ability to recover, and you can start seeing benefits from even a small amount of it done at an easy effort level. Later in this post I have an example program that only takes 20 minutes three times a week. ETA: [Here's the cheat sheet version](https://imgur.com/gallery/egnHKwC), screenshot this and you'll be on your way.

But first, the why.

## Why you shouldn't overlook cardio: science edition

First: for health. The American Heart Association, World Health Organization, and others [recommend 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity). *Lifting does not count;* we should all do resistance training too, but it isn't included in that total.

Second: for gainz. While there's a myth that cardio kills your gains, the opposite is far more likely to be true. To quote Greg Nuckols, in the article [""Why Avoiding Cardio Could Be Holding You Back](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/avoiding-cardio-could-be-holding-you-back/)"" (a really good read, btw):

>The more powerful your aerobic energy system, the more reps you’ll be able to do with a given weight or percentage of your max, because every bit of energy you can produce aerobically is that much less that you have to produce anaerobically, which pushes off those factors that cause acute muscular fatigue. Also, if you do the same number of reps with a given amount of weight, less of the energetic contribution will come from your anaerobic energy systems, so the set will be less fatiguing. So you’re either looking at more work and the same fatigue, or the same amount of work with less fatigue; either way, you win.  
>  
>This actually relates to a past article about sex differences: Women can generally do more reps with a given percentage of their 1rm because they generally have higher aerobic and lower anaerobic capacity per pound of lean body mass than men.

and

>Your aerobic system is what produces the energy necessary to restore intracellular ATP and PCr levels, metabolize lactate, and generally get you headed back toward homeostasis so you can perform the next set. Better aerobic conditioning means you’ll recover faster between sets (and since you’ll be somewhat less reliant on your anaerobic system for each set, they’ll be less fatiguing in the first place) so you can handle higher total training volume.

So if you have a strong aerobic system, that means:

* more reps per set
* better recovery between sets
* less fatigue for a given amount of work
* you can handle more training

This means a good aerobic system directly benefits your ability to lift more. The harder you can train without tiring yourself out, the better your potential for strength and hypertrophy.

Additionally, the stronger you get, the more weight you'll need to move. The more weight you're moving, the harder your energy systems have to work. When you're deadlifting 300 pounds, your body needs to do more physical work--even if it doesn't feel that much harder--than when you used to deadlift 135. So cardio is also an investment in your future gains.

Not to mention: your performance in strength sports will benefit from having a good aerobic base, whether it's that sport's main goal or not. In strongman, static strength isn't enough to win meets; you need to be able to do things fast, with most contests requiring you to do one-minute sets (or longer) for carries, medleys, and max reps. In kettlebell sport and in crossfit, strength bleeds into strength endurance into aerobic endurance. You have to be good with all your energy systems to succeed.

Even in powerlifting and weightlifting, the better conditioned you are, the less you have to worry about tiring yourself out with warmups and early attempts. If you're a weightlifter and hate having to ""follow yourself"" (do two attempts with only a minute's rest in between), cardio is important to you too.

And even in the gym, if you don't plan to compete: who doesn't want to be able to do more work with less fatigue?

## Why you shouldn't overlook cardio: personal story time

I've been on both sides of this. I used to be a runner (albeit a slow one) who skipped strength training. More recently, I've been the stereotypical lifter who avoids cardio. But here's the thing: when I started adding some cardio back into my routine, my lifting got SO much better.

A clean and jerk triple used to leave me completely gassed. I took long rests between sets of squats or deadlifts, like, 5-10 minutes if they were getting heavy. I joked that anything over five reps was cardio, but it was also kind of true. High rep sets were torture.

But a year or two ago, I started adding some cardio into my routine, mostly with easy jogging. And last summer (2021) I took conditioning more seriously, running [Building the Monolith](https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101078918-building-the-monolith-5-3-1-for-size) on top of my normal weightlifting programming. So, yes, I was running two full programs at the same time, one of which (BtM) called for cardio and conditioning as part of it. And to save time, I blasted through my BtM workouts by supersetting everything. A given workout might have 12 sets of presses, 100 band pulls, and a 20-rep squat set, plus more squats and chinups and shrugs. I made it a point to try do the whole thing in an hour or less. The cardio I had added previously benefited me here; and simply doing this much work this fast built my capacity to do even more.

I overheard my weightlifting coach telling another lifter that ""Beth can do that because she has Wolverine genetics,"" which made me laugh, because my work capacity was never like this before! Definitely not a thing I was born with.

Later that year, I [competed in a strongman meet](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUBTY63gP1g/) that included a 275-pound deadlift for reps. I did THIRTEEN reps, even though my deadlift 1rm was 315 or so. Going by the calculators (which *used* to always work for me), 275 should have been a 5RM. But I wasn't fatigued at 5 reps. I slowed down around 8. I paused at 10. I was shocked that I had time left at that point, so I did two more reps, and then I *still* had time left, so I did one more right at the buzzer. What the hell. I hadn't known I had it in me.

## But what if I hate cardio and it makes me feel like I want to die?

Good news! You don't need a lot of cardio to start seeing major improvements. The inspiration for this post was a client I worked with over the past few months. [She is a powerlifter](https://www.instagram.com/i.like.carbs/) who wanted better conditioning to improve her lifting. I gave her the most basic, minimalist cardio program, which went a little something like this:

* Monday: 20 minutes LISS (low intensity steady state cardio) on a bike
* Wednesday: 20 minutes LISS again
* Friday: a short conditioning workout, usually 10 minutes prowler pushes or bike sprints with plenty of rest in between

The first week, she said, she felt tired. By the second week, squats were feeling easier. By the end of the month, we repeated a prowler test (max distance with a given weight in 5 minutes) and her score improved from 100 yards to 160. After the second month, she was up to 200 yards.

All from three workouts each week that were never crazy hard, and never took much time. She told me afterward: ""I honestly enjoy cardio more now after starting this. I, for a long time, had the impression that you had to go borderline hard effort on cardio sessions for it to be effective. And since I lift heavy for 2 hours at a time, it was sus since I didn't want to kill all my energy in the gym.""

I knew this approach was going to work, but even *I* was surprised at how quickly she saw results with fairly easy effort. Cardio works.

## What's the minimum I need to see results?

First, the most important thing for lifters is that your cardio routine *doesn't wreck you*. Your priority is your lifting, so you need to still be able to show up to the gym and crush your workouts. While HIIT is often touted as a time saver, LISS is actually a better fit here because it has a very minimal recovery cost.

LISS is also great as a foundation because it works your aerobic energy systems. Your aerobic capabilities are the ""base"" that supports all other types of conditioning. What helps you recover between sets of lifting, or between intervals of a conditioning workout? That's right, your aerobic capacity. (For another super interesting read, check out [this case study about increasing a runner's VO2max through broadening their aerobic base](https://simplifaster.com/articles/how-trainable-is-vo2-max/).)

If you only did LISS, you'd be off to a good start. But I think it's good to include conditioning, too. This means you're doing work that ideally uses your whole body, and that isn't continuous and steady. Kettlebell swings (heavy enough to need frequent rest) and prowler pushes are some of the best options, since the recovery cost for those is pretty low. If you want to stick to cardio machines, you can do something similar with sprints on a rowing machine, bike, etc.

If you get bored of the same old bike sprints and prowler pushes, do a [Crossfit WOD](https://wodwell.com/wods/category/other-benchmarks-workouts/?feeds=none&sort=popular) or one of the HIC workouts from [Tactical Barbell II](https://www.amazon.com/Tactical-Barbell-2-Conditioning/dp/1537710443) or, if you dare, pick something from [Mythical's Book of Bad Ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pimzfr/per_request_my_free_ebook_mythical_strengths/). Just promise me you will start with something that is *short*, no more than 10 minutes your first time. When your work capacity increases, feel free to do more.

These conditioning workouts serve two purposes. One is to work the higher-intensity systems that LISS doesn't work directly; these are more aerobic than lifting, but more anaerobic than LISS.

The other is to give you a benchmark for testing. ""I feel better between sets of squats"" is subjective; ""I can push the prowler 200 yards in the same time it used to take me to cover 100"" is objective. You could also use other types of tests if you like: run a mile on a track and watch your time go down as you get better; or if you get into Peloton, do their FTP test.

## An example program you can start with

[Here is a calendar version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FnRHnG37m_B5-XULRC2v0XLEvOkkjmAu/view?usp=sharing) of the program I gave my client. It's pretty minimalist, just 20 minutes three times a week, and two of those workouts are LISS, so they are meant to feel easy. It's the gentlest introduction I can think of to cardio, even if (or especially if!) you've found cardio miserable in the past.

Here's the explanation:

**LISS days** are moderate cardio. You should feel like you're breathing heavier than at rest, and probably sweating a bit. But you should *not* feel like you're dying or gasping for air. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is max effort, this should feel like a 3 or 4.

You can do any type of cardio where you can keep up that kind of effort. A stationary bike or elliptical is great; just keep up that level of effort. If you choose a treadmill or an outdoor run, you may be able to hit this effort level with a brisk walk or by alternating running and walking. Do NOT do a run-walk program like couch to 5k; it's too easy to turn that into a sprint-and-rest interval workout. You want to do your best to keep up a steady effort.

**Cardio intervals** (alternate Fridays) can be done on any of the cardio machines/modalities above. If you're on foot, you'll run for the hard parts, and walk for the easy parts. If you're on a bike, you'll pedal at a hard effort for the hard parts and pedal easy for the easy parts. The hard effort here should be as hard as you can maintain for the specified interval without wrecking yourself for the next one. Think maybe an 8/10 effort. But if you screw up and go too hard or too easy, don't give up and don't reset the clock. Just keep going and adjust your pace on the next one.

The intervals in this example are :30 hard, 1:30 easy, but you could use other interval lengths. One minute on/one minute off is another good one.

**Prowler test** (once a month) - you do NOT need a prowler to do this. You can substitute anything that is full-body hard work but where your lungs are what give out first. Other options would be HEAVY kettlebell swings, sandbag carries, or (I'm so sorry) burpees. A crossfit benchmark WOD wouldn't be a bad idea here either, so long as you feel pretty confident you can recover from it before your next lifting day.

If you're doing the prowler or one of the DIY test options, on your first test day, find an intensity where you can work hard for 20-30 seconds, need to rest for the remainder of the minute, and be ready to go again by the end of the minute. Take notes so you can repeat this test later. For example, if you used a kettlebell, write down the weight of the kettlebell. If you used a prowler, write down the weight on the prowler and measure the distance. Figuring this out will be your warmup. Rest until ready, then test yourself by setting a timer for 5 minutes and seeing how much you can do in that time.

On later test days, do the exact same thing--same kettlebell weight, same prowler loaded to the same weight--but try to beat your score (more swings of the kettlebell, more lengths on the prowler, etc).

## How to fit this into your lifting routine

The first week you do this, you may be more fatigued than usual. Be prepared for that, and maybe don't start this program the week before a meet or anything.

You can do the cardio workouts on your non-lifting days, or you can do them after lifting, whichever is more convenient for you.

Once you're used to this routine, it will be part of your baseline and you can keep it up even when you're deloading or while you're tapering for meets. The only change I would make on meet week would be skipping that week's Friday conditioning and replacing it with a LISS session or some extra rest.

## How to progress

If you’re currently doing nothing, I recommend starting off with this minimal amount of work: just 20 minutes for the LISS sessions, and no more than 10 minutes for conditioning (you can do a 5 minute warmup and cooldown for those).

After that, work toward meeting the minimum guidelines for health (150 minutes per week of moderate effort; each minute of hard effort counts double). Even brisk walks count, so adding a few of those each week will get you there.

Beyond that, progressive overload is not required. If you're happy with your conditioning, you can just keep doing the same routine forever.

If you'd like to progress, start by adding more LISS. Extend the 20-minute workouts to 25 or 30 minutes. Extend your warmup and cooldown on the conditioning days. You can even add an extra LISS day, and if you're still recovering well after a week or two, add another. You can increase the hard conditioning *slightly*, but don't try to double it or triple it right out of the gate. This stuff will leave you more fatigued than the LISS, so tread carefully, ok?

As a final note, if you add cardio (using the example program or one you design based on these guidelines) and see results, I'd love to hear how it went for you!"

Disordered,"Seeing Better Results on a Bro Split?  Hello all,

For a couple of years, I have been weight training using the PPL program, where each muscle group gets stimulated twice per week. Although I've obviously seen and felt great progress over this span of time, I always felt as though I was taxing my body and hindering my recovery. I was getting stronger and more muscular, but progress was incredibly slow. My strength would stall for up to a month at times, and it would take every ounce of effort just to get that additional rep to ensure ""progressive overload."" I kept my sets at 8 per muscle group per session, totaling 16 sets for each muscle at week's end.

However, ever since I switched over to the Bro Split, I always come back into the gym feeling more than ready. To my pleasant surprise, my strength is climbing faster than ever before. I'm able to get an additional 2-3 reps per week using the same heavy weights that I'd otherwise be stalled on using PPL.This newfound and superior progress is keeping me motivated. I'm currently doing between 12-16 intense sets for each muscle group once a week.

I don't understand why the Bro Split gets so much hate. People act as if it's the worst program a lifter could utilize to better themselves. Could this be an individualistic thing?

Thanks for any input."

Disordered,"Strategies For Achieving 10% Body Fat and Pushing Through a Plateau  #  Context:

I am trying to get to 10% body fat for the first time. It's been proving pretty difficult, but one thing has more or less helped me through the entire process-- understanding caloric deficit. I've been trying to keep myself in a caloric deficit for a while now, but I've run into a problem. I'm at just under 12% bodyfat, eating roughly 1300 calories per day, and plateauing. I understand that reaching a goal such as 10% body fat requires strict dietary requirements, but from what I've seen, other people can achieve the same goal, all the while eating more calories.

I tried to look online just to get a general idea of how many calories other people were eating to reach the same milestone, only to not be able to find any numerical answer. The best I could do was brief mentions from fitness YouTubers where they would say roughly 1800\~2000 calories, which is substantially more than I am currently intaking. I am primarily interested in developing an understanding of what is *generally* normal caloric intake for those trying to reach certain body fat goals, because there seems to not be a clear consensus; I understand full well that it varies from individual to individual, so to reiterate, I'm just trying to create a range so as to establish normalcy.

It is my hope to learn and improve my own diet, and for this post to help others do so as well.

# Details on me, if you want a better picture:

* 5'8""
* Male
* 19 Years old, almost 20
* Substantial muscular development (could pass as a Marvel Hero)
* Currently at 11.9% body fat (using an electric scale)
* Between 158 and 160 lbs (fluctuates, just wanted to give a good idea)

# Typical diet consists of:

* Supplements, including: amino acid pills, fish oils for omega-3s, zinc, selenium, and multivitamin gummies (Don't judge me, I like what I like), **70 calories**
* 1/2 cup of oatmeal + scoop of protein (**25g protein**) + 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder, **300 calories**
* Caffeinated coffee, 1/3 cup almond milk (unsweetened) + 3 packets of Splenda, **20 calories**
* Post workout protein shake, 1 scoop protein (**25g protein**) + 1 scoop of creatine + 1 table spoon of unsweetened cocoa powder, **150 calories**
* 5 ounces of chicken breast, twice a day. To be safe, I round up to 50 calories an ounce. I do this because I marinate the chicken, and use a bit of olive oil and a bit of sauce in the marinade. 50x5x2 = **500 calories, 90 grams of protein**
* Single Drumstick brand ice cream cone (I know that ice cream isn't healthy, but considering how few calories I otherwise eat in the day, I figured it was acceptable, especially considering how it helps prevent me from splurging and, consequently, backtracking). Roughly **290 calories**
* 4 cans of diet soda a day, 2 of which are caffeinated. While claiming zero calories, it is said by some that they actually have roughly 1 calorie per can, so **4 negligible calories**
* Every so often, a cup of decaf coffee as well + 1/3 cup almond milk + 3-4 Splenda packets, **20 calories**
* Grand whopping total of **1334-1354 calories per day, and 140 grams of protein**

# Exercise:

* Weightlifting 6 days a week; in the gym for about an hour each workout, so 6ish hours a week. I don't do cardio as I hear it can prevent muscle growth, and even cause muscular dystrophy, as well as increase hunger. 

# Timeline:

* I've been dieting since January, and have been lifting since February of last year.

Disordered,"The Odd, the Old, and the Original: The Case for Atypical Lifting  **Introduction**: 

Today I want to talk about, and make a case for, all of the old, the odd, and the original lifts that don’t see common use in the majority of the population’s training. I find that they often garner some polarizing responses, and I want to try to convince you, the reader, to maybe give them a shot, or at very least change any negative attitude you might have towards them. I think they have quite a bit to offer and that their supposed negatives are often exaggerated or baseless. 

First, a little bit about myself and my history with atypical lifts, and then a short breakdown of what this post is going to contain before jumping into the meat. 

I do *a lot* of unusual lifts. I have for quite a while now. I’ve won a World Championship in Egolifting. I hold, to the best of my knowledge, a [World Record in the Zercher Deadlift at 550lb/250kg](https://youtu.be/ZUhlMyvvqOA). I have, again to the best of my knowledge, unofficial records for multiple USAWA lifts. I know my 1RM for [Squat](https://youtu.be/uQ3RPE2nIec), [Bench](https://youtu.be/GGETz4BZYFI) and [Dead](https://youtu.be/5Mrn8aDsvKg) performed with two barbells. I’ve [squatted my Log](https://youtu.be/pRE4i0MRwg8), [deadlifted my SSB](https://youtu.be/8pn0gb0aMxo), and [benched my Trap Bar](https://youtu.be/IvC9kNWcltE). I’ve used just about every bar I own for every lift it is not intended for and I have no intention of stopping any time soon. I don’t know how one would qualify as an ‘expert’ in this field, but I like to think I am up there. 

Here is a list of the topics I am going to cover if you choose to keep reading, along with brief descriptions. 
*Concepts and Definitions*: This section just clarifies some of the terminology and concepts I will be referring to, in order to prevent confusion. 

*The Benefits of the Odd, the Old and the Original*: This section covers what I see as the benefits of these kinds of atypical lifts, both from a subjective and an objective standpoint. 

*Arguments Against Common Criticisms*: This section offers rebuttals to the most common complaints I see about these kinds of lifts. 

*Application*: This section looks at how you can introduce this kind of lift into your training, based on how I have chosen to do so. 

With that covered we can get started. 

**Concepts and Definitions**: I start most things I write with a section outlining *my* definitions of terms and concepts. I find that it helps prevent disagreement based solely on different interpretations of specific terminology. 

*Strength*: Strength is a term that seems clear, but I think it is a lot more nuanced than most people consider it. ‘Strength’ in a general sense is multifactorial consisting of three primary components:

-Skill: The skill component represents how effective your movement pattern is in directing force produced into moving weight. This represents all technical aspects of a lift.

-Muscle size: The force production potential of a muscle is determined by its cross-sectional area. A larger muscle is a stronger muscle. Do note that this does not mean that person with larger muscles can always outlift someone with smaller muscles, as this is only one of the factors in determining strength. 

-Neurological components: This is going to be a catch all for a lot of other aspects related to your mind and nervous system. You need to develop the ability to maximally recruit your muscle fibers to produce their full force potential. This, alongside other similar factors, is the neurological component of strength. On a less directly biological side, you also need to develop the proper mindset to exert maximal effort, which I will lump in here as well. 

It should be worth noting that an individual’s anatomy (bone length/proportions, muscle insertion/origin sites, connective tissue length, etc) can impact how much they can lift. But this cannot be improved or changed so we will not focus on it. 

With these components established, I want to differentiate the ideas of ‘Specific Strength’ and ‘General Strength’ as I see them. 

*Specific Strength*: this is the strength you can express in a specific movement. It represents the sum of all three factors above and applies to lifts you have specifically trained in which the skill component is strongly represented. 

*General Strength*: this is, essentially, strength in the absence of the skill component. It’s how much strength you can leverage in a movement that is foreign to you, or a familiar movement in conditions that negate your established technical skill. 

 Next I want to quickly define the types of lifts I will be talking about:

*Odd Lifts*: These are lifts that don’t have much of an established history, and are not featured prominently in most people’s training, but are otherwise defined somewhere. The best collection of odd lifts would be the USAWA Rulebook, which features hundreds of contested lifts. Examples include a Scott Lift, Reverse Grip Press, Hip Lift, and Single Arm Bench Press. 

*Old Lifts*: Old lifts are lifts that had prominence at one point, but have mostly fallen on the wayside in modern training. Lifts like the old-time circus strongmen lifts fall into this category. The main difference between these and odd lifts is the historical aspect. Examples include Bent Press, Steinborn Squat, Two Hands Anyhow, Pullover and Press. 

*Original Lifts*: This category is anything you can imagine that isn’t really recorded anywhere else. These are purely original lifts that you come up with (even if someone has already thought to do the same lift independently). Some of my examples are Trap Bar Back Squat, Two Barbell Steinborn Squat, Vertical Trap Bar Bench Press. 

*Atypical Lifts*: These are lifts that are not trained regularly/at all. On a greater population level this includes the Odd, Old and Original Lifts listed above, but might include more/exclude some for the individual. For someone who does not train the Olympic Weightlifting movements a Snatch might be an atypical lift, while its obviously not for an Olympic Weightlifter. 

*Typical Lifts*: Lifts trained regularly, pretty much the opposite of atypical lifts. 

The last two concepts I want to quickly touch on are *building strength* versus *expressing strength*. Building strength is the process of increasing your strength potential. This does not necessarily include heavy work, or hitting PRs. It is any process that increases your strength peak potential. A hypertrophy block, seemingly ironically, is a strength building period. 

Expressing strength is simply displaying that potential. Performing a rep max is an expression of strength. The process of expressing the most strength possible usually involves processes counter to those used to build it. A peaking protocol will allow you to express more strength, but is not going to do a good job of building it. 

**The Benefits of the Odd, Old, and Original**

The benefits of these kinds of atypical lifts can be broadly categorized into subjective and objective. 

*Subjective Benefits*:

To me, these lifts are a lot more fun and interesting than the lifts I perform on a regular basis. I find joy in breaking up the monotony to challenge my strength with the old and odd lifts, and in challenging my creativity coming up with the original lifts. I am sure that this does not apply to everyone, but I think that many people have never even given these kinds of lifts a chance to see if they enjoy them as I do. They are novel, which really stands out in an activity generally featuring extreme repetition. 

Beyond personal enjoyment, they can be more enjoyable for the outside observer. The old lifts listed above have a history in circus strongmen shows, where they would be performed for the entertainment of an audience. They are fun to watch, and that has not changed even if the circus strongman has mostly ceased to be a thing. Original lifts are a form of creative expression, and while I won’t call them ‘art’ they are something that can be enjoyed by an audience. This notion seems to get attacked quite often as people ridicule the idea of lifting for an audience as ‘clout chasing’ or ‘attention seeking’. I would say “So?”. No one seems to get as upset about sharing other creative endeavors, or typical lifting achievements. What makes this any different? 

Another subjective benefit is that you are moving to a much smaller playing field if you want to be really good at something relative to the greater population of lifters. I will never deadlift 502kg to take the world record in that movement. I *can* Zercher Deadlift 250kg, however, to take that unofficial world record. The same goes for many of these lifts. I have already surpassed multiple records in the USAWA record book, and have yet to find any evidence of a higher single leg deadlift than my 405lb pull. Sure not many people choose to pursue these movements, and that makes it much easier to be the best, but that is on them. Everyone has the option to try, and I do not think it invalidates one’s accomplishments just because they choose not to. If you ever wanted to be world class in a lift, your likelihood of accomplishing that is much higher in a niche lift. 

*Objective Benefits*:

The objective benefits of atypical lifts all center around the idea that they allow you to test and develop your general strength and physical preparedness in a way that typical lifts do not. As I defined it above, general strength is your ability to move weight in the absence of significant practice. It is a function of your size, ability to generate force with that size, and bodily awareness to channel that force effectively in the absence of specific training to do so. I’m going to break this general idea down into several points. 

Atypical lifts present an excellent way to test your general strength. If you are heavily practiced in a movement pattern you are, hopefully, going to be relatively strong in it. There is nothing wrong with this. Its not ‘fake’ strength, it’s not a misrepresentation of how strong you ‘really’ are. Specificity is an excellent way to be stronger in lifts you want to be stronger in. But if you stick strictly to this specific training you lose out on strength gains on a more general level. You develop muscle memory that you rely on more than you do your general bodily awareness. If you move outside that specific movement pattern your strength declines as you lose the skill component. This can bottleneck your potential in a way. Again, I do not want to suggest that specificity has no carry over to general strength. If you hyper focus on bench press and push your numbers very high you are almost certainly going to be stronger in anything resembling a press than most people, but there will still be a drop off when you leave your practiced technique. Seeing how well you stack up in unpracticed movements compared to practiced movements that use similar muscles can help illuminate how big that gap between your specific strength and general strength is, if you care about that. 

Beyond testing your general strength, you can build it with regular introduction of atypical lifts. By challenging your body to figure out how to move loads without falling back on ingrained movement patterns you can increase your overall bodily awareness. You develop a more innate sense on how to work with weights in new and unusual movement patterns. Think of it as raising your baseline when it comes to the skill component of strength. If you develop this bodily awareness you are effectively ‘a little skilled’ in any lift you want to try. It’s important to note that the key is *atypical* lifts. If you take a niche lift and practice it regularly it is no longer an atypical lift to you. This is also totally fine, but I want to stress that the distinction between typical and atypical lifts is dependent exclusively on *your* programming, not on the lifts themselves. 

To bring personal experience into this, I have found that my ability to adapt to and learn new lifts has increased dramatically since I’ve expanded the scope of what lifts I perform. This includes niche lifts as well as more common lifts that I just never practiced. Before I introduced this variety, I would struggle with something like barbell back squat if I didn’t have a perfect set up, if my mind wasn’t focused, etc. How much I could squat would vary wildly based on external, and internal, variables. Working in a large variety of movements that could be loosely considered ‘squats’ has made me much more consistent in back squats. I can now adapt to little changes better and muscle through when I have minor technical slips. This goes for my other main lifts, as well as movement patterns that don’t have an obvious corresponding typical barbell compound. I pulled a Zercher Deadlift record on my first day trying it. I generally can manage a respectable max in a new lift with no practice.  I certainly would be better at any given one of them with extensive technical refinement, but that gap is a lot smaller than I expect it would be in most people. 

This general strength applies outside the gym as well. ‘Real’ life lifting often does not allow you to choose your circumstances and movement pattern as a gym lift does. Being accustomed to moving things in new and unusual ways is going to have substantial carryover to dealing with loads in day to day life. I work in the nuclear pharmaceutical industry. Despite not working in the department primarily concerned with the radioactivity, I often get called in to move around all the lead-lined equipment used to work safely with hot samples. I have shifted a solid lead barrel weighing over 1000lbs up off a pallet and onto a raised roller cart. That movement pattern has absolutely no corresponding lift, and I don’t know how you would recreate it, but I managed it with only moderate difficulty. Many people claim to strength train for general wellbeing and functionality in daily life. Well developing your general strength and bodily awareness with lifts you are not used to is a big part of that. 

Beyond the benefits of regularly challenging yourself with unfamiliar movements, many of the old lifts particularly offer a training stimulus that is unlike anything you will find in more conventional training. Take for instance the bent press. The ‘outward’ lateral press motion is something I have not seen in any other movement, as is the stabilization of your body in the bent and rotated position. These incredibly novel movement patterns will train your muscles and mobility in a way that nothing else will. Is this significantly beneficial in ways beyond being good at bent presses? I could not say for sure, but I do not think that expanding the range in which you are strong and capable is ever a *bad* thing. Again, note that if you choose to train something like the bent press regularly, then it is no longer an ‘atypical’ lift *for you*. It becomes a typical lift just like anything else you practice regularly.

The final benefit is somewhere between subjective and objective. Performing lifts you are not accustomed to, and are perhaps uncomfortable with, builds your mindset. It builds an immense trust in your body’s abilities, you become much more confident that your body is capable of being safe, strong, and functional in ‘compromised’ or ‘incorrect’ positions. This helps break through mental barriers in your regular lifts. If you are terrified of the risks of minor technical deviations when pushing yourself hard this will help. Its hard to be concerned that you are pushing yourself with a lift slightly outside your regular groove when you have successfully pushed yourself in movements that are a whole zip code away from any groove you’ve ever been in. Being able to push yourself when outside your ‘comfort zone’ is a valuable skill to have. If you can only functional in heavily controlled conditions you are going to leave a lot of chances to get better on the table, as life is not always going to serve you training sessions when everything goes your way. Being confident that you can adapt and perform when things go off a bit will let you capitalize on all the time that would otherwise be wasted because you could not maintain your rigid, ideal, technique. 

**Arguments Against Common Criticisms**: 

The complaint about these kinds of lifts that I see most often, probably more than every other type of complaint added together, is that they are more injurious that conventional lifts. This is bullshit born of a fear of the unknown. No movement pattern is inherently more injurious that any other, injury is born of load, not ‘form’. Your body does not have some innate proclivity to a conventional deadlift over a Zercher deadlift. It does not have a biologically ingrained set of ‘okay’ movement patterns, it makes no sense to believe that it would if you think about it for more than a few seconds. People have come to mistake ubiquity with correctness, they believe that because they see certain lifts performed all the time that they must be the right, safe and effective lifts, while things that they do not see regularly are wrong, dangerous and ineffective. This is not a valid argument. In fact, I would argue that atypical lifts are *less* likely to produce injuries if you are loading them at all responsibility. In the absence of any kind of technical practice they are going to be limited more heavily by lack of efficiency and familiarity than by lack of your bodies force production potential. To put it more simply, your body will not strain as much because the lifts will fail because you are not doing them well before they will fail because your body can’t keep up. A failure due to technical inefficiency is a lot less likely to cause an injury than a failure because your lift pushed your body too hard. 

As touched on earlier, I would go so far as to say that training atypical lifts regularly will reduce your overall chances of injury. Being more adapted to techniques and movement patterns outside those you drill regularly will reduce the chance of injury due to accidents in regular training. Having the bodily awareness to adapt to unusual loads will let your respond better when you misgroove a lift or otherwise find yourself outside your regular technique. Responding better means you are less likely to experience an injury from such events. 

A less common complaint is that they are not ‘optimal’ or even beneficial in training muscles or strength. And this is, in some cases, true. But they are not meant to be the exclusive way to train your strength and muscles, or even the predominate way. I am not here to advocate training like Joel Seedman says you should. Your entire training regime should not consist of messing around with random lifts (though even this can work if you really *really* bust your ass, it’s not a good idea for most people). They are a seasoning, a little something you sprinkle in for the benefits mentioned above. You can and probably should still base the bulk of your training around the commonplace movements. When used sparingly, they offer benefits your common lifts might not, and at little to no cost. 

Another occasional argument is that no “real [insert any kind of athlete]” uses these movements or that no trainer will recommend them. Well first off 99% of trainers are random schmucks and their words and ideas mean nothing. I don’t even deign to acknowledge that half of the argument. As for athletes, they train for a specific purpose. These lifts probably don’t benefit that purpose. Training for a sport is training with a specific actions in mind, not with a goal of a vast scope of ability. A powerlifter does not care how well they can do a lot of things, they care how much they can Bench, Squat and Deadlift for one rep. They are training for specificity. As seen in most of the rest of this write up these lifts are aimed more at developing general strength and ability, not specific strength and ability. 

**Application**:

Finally I want to talk about how I incorporate atypical lifts and what bringing odd, old and original lifts into your training might look like. 

As I said in the previous section, your training should remain largely unchanged. This is not a complete overhaul, its merely a recommendation to incorporate a few unusual lifts from time to time. I’ll mess around with an odd lift when I feel inspired to do so. Sometimes this means a lot in quick succession, sometimes it means gaps without anything. I would say they average maybe once a week. I usually perform them outside my regular training sessions, but they can also be tacked onto or replace parts of lower volume days. 

I don’t generally warm up extensively with the movement, but you could. At most I get a general warm up in then pick a weight I think will be challenging to start with. Sometimes I will overestimate and I’ll have to drop some weight, sometimes I will underestimate and keep loading weight and hitting more reps until I complete a difficult rep.  I lot of these lifts are more conducive to single reps than longer sets, so that is how I do the majority of them. I do not push to an absolute max on purpose, unless I really feel that the movement is clicking. I will fail reps sometimes, and sometimes I will load up what I think is a hard rep and it ends up being a max effort lift, but that’s not the goal. I think that this is a good effort level to push for, but if you are not very aware of your body or absolutely cannot risk an injury then you can be more conservative. 

You can also choose some of these unusual lifts to adopt into training regularly. With some of these, like the bent press, you really are not going to be remotely good at without extensive training because they are so alien compared to when you are familiar with. If you want to do this just treat them like you would any other lift. No need to do anything special because they are weird. 

Finally I will briefly talk about what goes into finding or making these kinds of lifts. As mentioned in the description the holy grail for odd lifts is probably the USAWA Rulebook. There are 300+ movements that are contested in that organization and pretty much every odd lift out there is covered in that book. Most are just slight variations on regular lifts, e.g. Reverse Grip Bench Press, but many are very much odd lifts, e.g. the Kelly Snatch. If you want to find odd lifts this is probably your number one source. 

Old lifts are mostly drawn from the old school strongmen, primarily in the late 1800s and early 1900s. There are quite a few social media accounts that talk a lot about lifting history and these can be a good place for inspiration. There are also a lot of older books on the subject, but finding these can be a pain. If nothing else just googling for circus strongman, or old school strongman will probably get you started. 

As for the original lifts those are up to you. You might be inspired because you see someone do something original, but many times you just gotta do whatever pops into your head. Here are some of the common prompts that I use when developing original lifts:

-‘What am I *not* supposed to do with this bar’: I have a pretty decent collection of bars (over 10 now) and often I will take a bar that is clearly designed for one purpose, like a Trap Bar is mostly for deadlifts, and use it for something else, like a Back Squat. This is a pretty easy formula to end up with some pretty creative lifts. Many bars are really not made to be used in certain movement patterns, so figuring out how to work around that physical constraint is a great exercise in creativity.

-‘Can I add implements’: Sometimes I see if I can’t work in multiple bars or other implements into a single lift. Having to balance and manage multiple weights can add novelty and difficulty. 

-‘Can I add asymmetry’: Most lifts are very symmetrical, adding asymmetry (using only one half of the body for a lift, or loading the implement unevenly) generally makes it easy to create something new. 

-‘That’s impossible/You can’t do that/X is dangerous’: sometimes you just need to prove someone wrong, that is also valid inspiration. 

**Conclusion**: That about wraps up everything I have to say on the topic. If you made it this far thanks for reading. If something was unclear or you want further clarification, please ask. Some of these ideas were a bit hard to articulate and I’m more than happy to better explain any parts of my position that didn’t fully make sense. I hope you will consider adding some atypical work to your training."

I've been using the Jackson/Pollock 3 Caliper Method (same method as this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj9chziWUk8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj9chziWUk8) or [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xho0tZRSEI8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xho0tZRSEI8)) to measure my body fat and I can tell it's not accurate. I get my mm measurements on all three points (I take them five times on each point, then take the average of each point) then input them here: [http://www.linear-software.com/online.html](http://www.linear-software.com/online.html). I've done it multiple times over the past three months and it's saying I'm 5.8% bf...which I'm definitely not.

The calipers I'm using are not great...but it's what I can manage to afford (maybe this is what's wrong?): [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B2MIDFY](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B2MIDFY)

Coach Greg uses a different approach here, but I don't have someone to measure me like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=977ZiIPP6Ko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=977ZiIPP6Ko)

**Anyway**...does anyone know why the Jackson/Pollock 3 Caliper Method is so off and what's the best method I could use to measure my bf by myself (without the help from someone else)?"

Disordered,"Lower back getting tight after Squat, deadlift and hyperextensions, is this normal?  I started squatting, deadlifts recently after a long time and I notice my lower back gets stuff af after a set or in between set. Like rock hard.

I observed same with hyper extensions of lower back, just body weight after 15-20 reps or aroujd 8-10 reps with 10-25 lbs. 

If I do foam rolling after, it loosens up by 70%. 

My question is : am I doing something wrong with these exercises or is this lower back tightness expected? 
It would be great if you could share how feel after/during squatting, deadlifting and hyperextensions.

Thanks.

Neutral,Gym Story Saturday  Hi! Welcome to your weekly thread where you can share your gym tales!
Neutral,"How accurate are lift comparison websites?  Hey guys, I have been using [this website](https://strengthlevel.com/) to compare myself to other lifters around the world. Don't get me wrong - I don't work out for comparison (I actually mostly do it for fun) but it is nice to see yourself moving slowly up the ranks. I also try to use it to spot areas where I am maybe lacking.

I have been wondering how accurate this website or websites like it are? For most of my lifts I solidly in the ""Novice"" category which means 6 months to 2 years of lifting according to them. This makes sense I have been lifting for 6 months and I already started out quite athletic. I am also improving at a steady rate with simple progression so I am definitely not in the intermediate stage. However, I really like lat pulldowns and can at this point do 87kg (I know that this is accurate because it can almost hold me up at 89kg bw) with 11 reps at 89kg bodyweight with really really solid form, slow eccentric and small pauses at bottom. This website says I am an advanced lifter with this exercise, which they say is 5+ years of training! I was able to do maybe 6 pullups before joining the gym. Is this because of my genetics favouring my back or should I distrust the website all together? Also, is it a problem that I my back seems to be much stronger than my front?

I know that I should first and foremost compare myself to myself, I just find this statistics stuff interesting.

Thanks."
Neutral,"How to brace/breathe while using an ab wheel?  Bracing when squatting or deadlifting is pretty straightforward. But when using an ab wheel, bracing feels kind of weird. 

Basically, if I *don't* brace then I can really feel my abs activating or ""crunching"" as I roll back to the starting position, [like so](https://imgur.com/a/bcXdumg). By activating I mean feeling my abs flex and stretch throughout the movement. 

However, if I *do* brace before rolling out, then as I come back up it's much harder for me to feel that ""squeeze"" or activation in my abs.

So is bracing taking away the effectiveness of the exercise? Is not bracing before every rep on the ab wheel a recipe for injury? Thanks."

There is no guiding question to help stir up some rage-feels, feel free to fire at will, ranting about anything and everything that's been pissing you off or getting on your nerves."
Disordered,"Olympic Speed Skater Training program  Nils Göran van der Poel is a Swedish speed skater who is the current world and Olympic record holder and reigning world and Olympic champion in the 5,000 m event and the 10,000 m event.

https://www.howtoskate.se/

He's wrote a PDF about his training. Covers his mental, physical, general thinking, and specific workouts on speed skating.
I found it fascinating from a fitness perspective- it’s blue print on how he built his training program including the specifics of speed skating.

 I'm clearly not an olympic athlete, nor am I going to train like one. And I have no interesting or competence in speed skating.  
However it is a way to build an elite level training program.

I found interesting data in here and inspiration.

 * He divides his fitness training into two axes: (1) Competition speed capacity and (2) aerobic capacity.   ""The physical ability that enabled my success was a very strong aerobic base.""  He doesn’t view it as an explosive power event (which is how most speed events are viewed now). 

 * He sees the event as a series of one legged lunges and tries to train for the event by basically doing the event in an empty ring.  “     you will become good at whatever it is that you train”

 * He cycles training to enable that specific training. It’s cycled in 5-2 training (5 days on 2 off)  and seasonal cycles.  “My yearly training program was divided into three different seasons. First the Aerobic season (aerobic), secondly Threshold season (10 weeks maximal training), thirdly Specific season (3 weeks prior to event) and lastly Aerobic season 2.0.” Which is back to “lower aerobic”- kind of a deload.  

By the way his lower aerobic training is 6h biking at 220W- way past most people’s maximal training.  His maximal is way higher, however the principles at work are similar for anyone.  He explains how he does  tapering, rest and eating during each cycle.


 * Consistency and motivation was important to him- training 5 days on 2 days off. Eliminating anything that interfered with that (including travel to test VO2 max). Some variation of training program due to recovery or rest with simple metrics indicating when to rest (heart rate was a key one).


It's the best thing I've read on fitness in a while.  He posts exact training notes in the guide.

I’m definitely picking things to apply.  I’ve not done much cyclic training.  I often do 6-8 weeks of a program, plateau, switch programs.  Or 6 week program, deload and then try again.   I will be designing my training with a more cyclical training program based on the pdf, goal oriented, with simple measurables and goals. 

I do listen to my body for rest days (I’m old- rest days are mostly yoga now).  His comment:     
“If you’re listening to the body when it whispers to you, you don't have to hear it scream.”, rings true for me. 
So does the advice on the mental portion in terms of coach and media interaction- which maybe important for young athletes. 

 But the concepts from it for mental that I’m applying is creating an environment (make it easy to train) and working motivation into the training/rest cycles.

Any way- I hope you read it and get as much inspiration and information out of it as I did, even if you aren't a speed skater."

Neutral,Gym Story Saturday  Hi! Welcome to your weekly thread where you can share your gym tales!
Neutral,"Advice with lifting journey  Hey guys. So I just wanted to get some feedback on what I’m doing well and poorly. I’m 30 and I’ve been lifting for 5+ years with some 6+ months long breaks. But the past 2 years I have been lifting (bulking and cutting) with not breaks beyond a couple months without a gym but still lifted at home. I’m pretty tired of going through building and cutting cycles so I kind of want to show a picture timeline along with my lifting routine and get some feedback. 

Couple things before. Yes I know my abs are absolute dogshit. I’ve never been able to see them. Even when I was in high school and was like 138 pounds there was nothing. But I wasn’t lifting Not sure it’s even too attainable for me or if I’d want to cut to that weight and not look as big. Idk

Chest has always been the weakest muscle group for me by far. I don’t feel it as much nearly as other muscles. I do wide grip bench, heavy dips, etc, but it’s hard to grow. 

Shoulder and mainly biceps are easily my best muscle areas. I’ve always had great arms. I’ve shown pics before and got accused of photoshopping my biceps. 

3/2020

https://imgur.com/a/1QOOExO

That’s me at March of 2020. Sorry don’t have a shirtless pic.  173 pounds.  I haven’t worked out in 6 months. Look pretty small in a shirt. Decided to start with a strong bulk to get muscle I had lost back. 

7/2020

https://imgur.com/a/s38CuDN

3.5 months later. 180 pounds. Benching 190 and sitting dumbbell shoulder raises about 60-65 pounds each side. 

10/2020

https://imgur.com/a/oRhxlyL

3 months later. Still 180. But had to take a 2 month break from gyms being shut down but was doing home workouts with bands and smaller weights for most of this time.

3 months later. 188 pounds. Look a lot bigger in a t shirt. Obviously some fat as well. I’m getting compliments which is nice with good fitting shirts. Benching 210 or so. Decided to start cutting at this point. 

6/21

https://imgur.com/a/gVL3ePi

https://imgur.com/a/vH9cRDu

These are all about a month or so apart 4 months after my cut. Obviously the pics immediately post workout looks better. And shaved hair haha. Weight 164-165 pounds. 185 bench press. So I lost about 23 pounds in 16 weeks which I think is not too much or too little. Although I lost fat I’m getting told I look smaller when wearing a shirt obviously. And got weaker. Decided to cut again because was stuck at low 160s. 

2/21

https://imgur.com/a/PrnRZ2k

Fast forward 8 months. 190 pounds now. Getting compliments in a shirt. Gained 24-25 pounds in about 30 weeks. benching the most I ever have at 235. 80 dumbbell sitting shoulder presses/raises. 

Not sure what to do and what to work on or do differently. I should definitely probably cut again. I workout 4x a week. Do sets of 6-8 

Monday. shoulder/biceps. 
Military barbell press 
Dumbbell fly
Barbell front shoulder raise 
Dumbbell curl
Barbell curl

Tuesday: chest/triceps

Bench press
Incline bench
Dumbbell bench
Dips
Rope tricep pull down 
Tricep overhead press

 Wednesday: back/legs

Squats
Dumbbell back row
Bulgarian split squats
Machine back row
Calf raises 

Friday: shoulder/bis

And so on. So hit them 3x every 2 weeks. 

Bulking I eat ground turkey and rice. And I eat +500 surplus

Cutting same things but -500 surplus. 


Any advice is recommended with a new workout plan to maybe mix it up. I’m looking to get stronger but have less body fat. The whole process I did that 4 days split routine. No special routines but I would like some proven ones that have worked for guys"

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.

Disordered,"1,000 Workouts Without a Rest Day  **TLDR**

Age: 36

Years lifting: 13

Height: 5’5”

Weight: 158 to 196.

1,000 consecutive workouts without a rest day.

In this period I accomplished numerous goals. Including a [1RM Press of 235 lbs](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5i4OGAAyl_/). (+10 lbs. PR), a [315 lbs. 20-rep max squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5nlw7pgZ04/) (both at 175 lbs. bodyweight), gaining size ([about 20 lbs. of lean mass](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYfsa0hAOr-/)), and stamina (I can shovel snow literally forever). To celebrate the 1,000th day, I completed 33 rounds in a [60-minute AMRAP of a 1,000 lbs. total](https://youtu.be/_M-GCGod4RE) (345 squat, 243 bench, 412 deadlift).

**Introduction**

Hello! /u/GZCL ([Cody](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPhXX0CgmbJ/)) here. Creator of the [GZCL Method](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html) and many popular programs derived from it. A good intro to the method is linked in the [/r/Fitness Wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/).

For over 1,000 days I have worked out without rest days. That means no days out of the gym, and no counting steps as a workout, nor yoga, and not even shoveling snow… quickly becoming my [least favorite activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIwyZefLyL4).

All my workouts used resistance training in some way. Workouts were 99% barbell based and all but about 30 were above 10,000 feet elevation, where my gym is nestled. My training is structured by and progressed through my [General Gainz](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/) training framework.

I accomplished these things by using a simple training framework, being consistent, and patience – the three foundational elements of progress.

**Goals**

· To see if I could.

· Assess potential for overtraining.

· Better regulate my training.

· Improve strength, size, stamina, and the condition of lingering injuries.

· To test and refine my General Gainz training framework and programs derived from it. (Read the above linked reddit post to get an idea of what that looks like.) All my personal training clients have also been lifting within this training framework.

One client has surpassed a year without a rest day. Read his fantastic write up:

[365 Days and Counting](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2021/).

**Results**

No missed workouts for 1000 consecutive days (closer to 1,050 now). Nearly all workouts consisted of lifting weights. Only one was bodyweight only (while on vacation, a fast paced, high volume, nauseating bodyweight circuit). Running, hiking, snow shoveling, etc., did not count as a workout, nor did yoga or other such activities. On many days in the winter because I live at over 10,000 feet elevation, I must shovel snow for hours. This I counted as survival, not training. Same for chopping and hauling wood in a sled. [Training is the means to survive easier.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIJuOsogabe/)

Because I was working out daily, I grew more aware of my recovery limits, thereby avoiding overtraining. This allowed me to better regulate my training as the days continued. Previously, when I was taking rest days, I counted time out of the gym as being a major aspect of recovery. That is a false notion. Because of that former belief I would go too hard in some workouts, figuring that “I would be out of the gym, and so recovering for the next session.” This was not always the case, as some workouts would go on for hours, often performing excessive amounts of sets and needlessly high intensities at all to frequent occurrences.

I had the mindset that a hard workout was always a beneficial workout and that a hard workout meant that I must be puking, shaking, or crawling out of the gym – I was wrong. A beneficial workout is one that produces a positive training stimulus while not increasing recovery debt so much that it inhibits the next workout. As I continued to train within my General Gainz framework I grew to understand this distinction and apply it consistently to my training. This improved the quality and consistency of my training. Compounding interest, but for gains.

I set personal records across rep ranges, from [1RM](https://www.instagram.com/p/B55q4pKggk3/) to 20RM, particularly for [press](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5i4OGAAyl_/) and [squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5nlw7pgZ04/). These are the two lifts that I have favored because they are less stressful on previously injured joints. Six weeks ago I hit a PR 203 lbs. [behind the neck press](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWmTgj5gZu9/) at random. It was just feeling good that day, so I went for it – an unusual decision for me lately – but old habits die hard. This lift improving shows me that my regular pressing is also, despite not currently being in an intensity directed training phase.

This was not my first bulk. But I do consider it my best. I gained 38 pounds between Day 31 and Day 1,000. Going from a low [of 158 pounds](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwItaivA_2-/) to a high of [196 pounds](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVjId0WA6KI/), with about 25 of those in 2021. I committed 2021 to a long bulk and a body building phase. The words are separated because I do not mean the sport, rather the goal of building muscle, particularly my arms and shoulders, as those were my goals.

Fat mass increased by about 5%, going from approximately 12% at 158 pounds bodyweight to 17% at 196 pounds bodyweight. This increased how much lean mass I am carrying by about 23.5 pounds (158\*.88=139, 196\*.83=162.6). ~~This means that in about 1,000 days I gained on average 1.4 pounds of muscle (and associated water weight) per month, or .35 pounds per week average. This is the biggest I have ever been.~~

~~(1000 days / 365 = 2.739 years \* 12 months = 32.868 months / 23 pounds = 1.42)~~ If my math is wrong here, let me know. I’m a pleb history major, not a king math wizard.

Math correction (I knew my math was wrong...): I gained 23 lbs of lean muscle of 32-ish months, hence about 0.7 lbs/month (or 1.4 months per lb). (Thank you /u/itsgilles )

Additionally, I achieved the goal of rehabbing a hip and shoulder that would often cause pain while lifting and during daily living.  In 2017 and 2018, before these last 1,000 days, I could not even do a bodyweight squat, or bench, or deadlift one plate without pain. That is no longer the case, as I can now squat four plates and deadlift five without those prior issues. Not my best weights for those lifts but considering what they were rebuilt from – it is great progress for me.

This was accomplished without training either of those lifts with powerlifting-esq training intensities during 2021. Likewise, despite bench pressing maybe five times in 2021, I still managed an easy [293 pound paused single](https://www.instagram.com/p/CW3ZKIsLQ69/). This lift is the one that causes my shoulder the most grief, so I have not trained it much in the last two years (a mistake discussed in the following section).

Lastly, during this period I exclusively used General Gainz as the basis for every workout. Doing so improved the concept by expanding and refining the framework. Throughout these 1,000 days it became easier to plan, execute, and assess workouts. Since I began lifting in 2008, my training evolved from random everything to percentage-based powerlifting focused, to volume, intensity, effort relationship based, with a general strength and conditioning focus. In my early powerlifting years, from “[OG GZCL](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html)” to [Jacked & Tan 2.0](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/07/jacked-tan-20.html) to [UHF](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/02/gzcl-applications-adaptations.html) and later [VDIP](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/11/volume-dependent-intensity-progression.html). The last of which grew into what became General Gainz.

**Injuries**

This section is not a prescription or advice. It is meant to describe how I improved the conditions physically ailing *me*. Consult your physician regarding your specific problems.

Do not use reddit to diagnose and treat your injuries!

During the 1,000-day period I sustained no major injuries. Only aggravating a previous tear to the right trapezius and rhomboid, and a left groin strain. Both were caused by pushing too aggressively in a single session, causing old injuries (hip and shoulder) to flare up. When this happened, I trained those areas using light resistance and high rep exercises to improve the affected muscles. I would then focus on unaffected muscles and movements, training them with more weight and/or volume.

For example, when benching caused my shoulder to stiffen or ache, I began to do more overhead pressing, a movement that did not cause such problems. Likewise for deadlift, which affected my hip more than squatting – so I squatted more.

When a movement or muscle was giving me problems, I simply ‘worked it out’ in a very literal sense. In fact, years ago I bought a specialty leg press ([Shuttle Systems MVP](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIKA3q2ALIs/)) to help rebuild my hip strength after the joint sustained multiple injuries; the worse of which were not due to lifting, but by falling (I am clumsy and unathletic).

Through exercise I was able to improve the deteriorating condition of my two problem areas, left hip and right shoulder, thereby gradually improving the lifts that tax them most. Granted, I am not at my [peak powerlifting strength](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvePo-WSuzg), but I have not been training for powerlifting for years now.

Where I could have done better is the bench press. Between 2012 to 2016 I had strained my right pec numerous times. This coupled with a once dislocated shoulder resulted in a total dislike of the bench by 2017, for even 135 pounds caused serious discomfort. Disheartened (as I once enjoyed the lift) I abandoned it almost completely these last three years. That I should not have done. Instead, I should have committed to regularly benching very light weights, alongside the other kinds of pressing that I had redirected towards (predominately the strict press).

Apart from those things described above I sustained no other injuries. Symptoms of overtraining, considered by some a kind of injury, were only experienced after months-long bouts of doing the same lifts daily (squat and press, later deadlift and press). Those symptoms were slight (and perhaps more psychological than physical) and came on the heels of testing High Frequency Undulating Progression (HFUP); a training program detailed in a link below. After ending the HFUP training cycle, symptoms of overtraining disappeared within days. Therefore, I do not think I had overtrained, I was just carrying more fatigue than I was used to at that time.

**Training Organization**

Workouts were built using my General Gainz training framework the entire period. From that framework, various training plans were built, tested, and improved. Training ranged from periods of high frequency and specificity, where I would do the same lift daily for a month or more (HFUP). Such periods resulted in all-time personal records for press, behind the neck press, and pause squat (linked above). Throughout 2021 I largely stuck to a body building training plan to achieve the goal of gaining size, especially to my arms and shoulders.

I have not done the same program throughout these 1,000 days, but I have stuck to the General Gainz framework, using it to construct numerous progressions to achieve various training goals. Example Training Plans:

[Generally Strong](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2019/10/): A flexible upper/lower split. (Post includes details on applications and adaptations of General Gainz; ideas to implement GG and improve your training.)

[High Frequency Undulating Progression](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2020/01/): (HFUP) Training the same lift(s) daily by changing the reps/sets/weights each workout.

[Wave LP](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/bw6qg0/general_gainz_wave_lp/): 4x Week Full Body. (Built by /u/ctye85) I’ve built and ran a similar progression to Wave LP.

[General Gainz Body Building](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/01/general-gainz-body-building.html): (GGBB) A body part split using supersets. This is the training plan I followed for most of 2021, in some form or another, as I was tinkering with what seemed to work best and changing the workouts as my recovery dictated. This means I was adjusting or changing exercises, order of exercises, volumes, and intensity, so that I could workout frequently – without training an under recovered muscle group. The linked post describes in greater detail a weekly progression outline, schedule options, exercises, supersets, etc.

With GGBB, I followed (mostly) a split of this nature:

Day 1: Legs

Day 2: Shoulders

Day 3: Back

Day 4: Arms

These were the muscle groups that were the focus in the workout. I would often do abs alongside legs or back, for example. (I did not train chest intentionally, but if that is your goal, then you can tailor GGBB to suit you.)

I would progress volume first, then once I hit a designated Rep Max (RM) target I would add weight and try to push that new weight to a higher RM. If in a workout I could not add reps to an RM set, I would do more reps in the sets that came after it.

Lift variations were used and rotated as I trained with GGBB. Such as doing SSB squat or Romanian deadlifts instead of the standard variety. Same for football bar press or incline bench. I used barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, cables, bands, TRX, etc.

The above linked posts detail the training plans I used during this period. Each was developed using General Gainz, which works by performing one or a combination of four actions to progress: Find/Hold/Push/Extend. Those concepts and associated progressions are also detailed in the above linked posts. (The GGBB post has a good intro to General Gainz.)

You can develop your own training plan using the GG framework. If you do, I have high confidence that you will be successful in achieving your lifting goals. GG provides a simple and intuitive organization and direction. Your consistency and patience produce the results.

My training is based in GG and so is my client’s training.

**How to Train Daily: Prioritize Recovery**

“Gains are made out of the gym” is a cliché.

One should not consider such a cliché the dominate factor in improving their physicality. People who say such things are often better at giving unsolicited advice than lifting weights.

To physically improve, it takes physical training. To consistently train, you need to recover – but that does not necessarily mean that sedentary days are required. There is nothing magical about staying out of the gym. Doing so does not guarantee an increased recovery rate.

If lifting regularly leaves you hobbled for a few days after, then you likely need more physical activity, not less. (And you also need to reassess how your training is set up. Follow a proven plan. Read the [/r/fitness wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/).)

Do more general physical preparedness (GPP) work, like snow shoveling, my favorite, not. If you don’t have snow, then just dig and fill the same hole in the dirt. If you don’t like those options, then push and pull a sled in the gym for an hour a few times per week. The point is that recovery is just as much about your work capacity as it is about your practices and habits outside the gym. None of which require staying out of the gym as a condition for success.

If you don’t want to lift weights or do manual labor daily, that’s fine. Go for walks, runs, bike – **do** something!

I have been able to recover from my workouts by prioritizing:

1.Eating and hydration.

2. Sleeping.

3. De-stressing.

People confuse not going to the gym with recovery because not doing something is easier than working on improving recovery habits. Knowing I had a workout tomorrow, I made those three things bigger priorities in my life. I was also able to better regulate my desire to absolutely crush myself, *because I have the weekend off and need to earn it*. (So I would say years ago.)

Time out of the gym is not the most important aspect of recovery. If it is for you, then you’re probably not prioritizing good recovery habits. An easy workout is better recovery than a hard night out partying, or a late night of Netflix, or a day full of stressed-out consumption of “news.”

Of the things listed above, I did the worst with eating. This has always been trouble for me, but I do think I improved a bit in this aspect these 1,000 days. Having always been a scrawny manlet, getting to 200 lbs. was my goal. I barely missed that. This is due to the many days where I forgot my lunch or was just too consumed by work to eat. I could do better here, and if I had, I know I would have had better results.

When it comes to nutrition, I have a consistent diet that is made up of rice, salad, eggs, and various meats. Often in the shape of a burrito.

I also eat a fair share of potatoes and bread but will limit those during a cut period when I am trying to lose weight. I do eat out a few times per month on average, but rarely more than once a week (if that). My most common meal is a salad with rice and beef. Since I was bulking for all of 2021, I simply increased the serving. In 2022, I’ll eat less, but typically the same kinds of foods.

Generally, my motto is: “If bulking, never be hungry. If cutting, always be.” And I try to bias my eating to the “Green Faces” practice (if it is green or had a face, eat it).

I tend to not track macros closely, nor calories. If I did, I would have had better results. 13+ years of training has developed my ability to gauge my own eating and practice good habits somewhat accurately and consistently. I could do better here, I admit.

As for hydration: I pee so often it sometimes annoys me.

Alcohol consumption is rarely more than a six pack per week. If I averaged out the number of beers drank over these 1,000 days, it would probably be one to two per week. Some weeks have more than others, especially if I find a beer I have not tried, and it turns out to be good.

I regularly get 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. If I do not, then I try to squeeze in a nap. I try to nap as much as I can. One to three a week on average.

De-stressing can be hard. To do this I have tried to limit my media exposure, which I determined to be the greatest source of stress for me. Doing so has reduced worrying about things I cannot control. I admit that I could do better, and just delete every social media account and stop watching and reading any current events whatsoever – perhaps later down the road.

I have found that spiritual and philosophical practices are helpful in de-stressing and am working on improving this aspect of my life. Same for reading literature. My favorite book from last year’s reading was Hemingway’s *A Farewell to Arms*.

Regarding supplements, I infrequently consume protein powder. Perhaps 3 to 5 scoops per week. Many weeks not even that much. I try to focus on whole foods as best as I can, and supplement as may be necessary (they’re called supplements, after all). More protein powder is consumed during bulking periods for this reason, as it is easier to get in a few ounces of fluids with 30 grams of protein than it is to eat that much more beef, chicken, or fish. On reflection, I should always have an emergency shaker of protein, just in case I forget my lunch.

Additional supplements I use are creatine, vitamin D, ZMA, Arginine and Ornithine. I had (have) an unhealthy amount of caffeine daily, but I have recently switched to half-caff and have drastically reduced my energy drink consumption. I try to keep it less than 300mg daily.

At no point in these 1,000 days have I used prescription or otherwise obtained performance enhancing drugs such as hormones, SARMS, pro-hormones, or steroids. I am not a “lifetime natural.” For about one year, ending in 2016, I tried TRT. I did not find it that helpful and I could no longer justify the cost. Well before that I was a crackhead addicted to Jack3d, which was basically crystal meth… *remembers the good ol’ days* (they were, in fact, not).

**Summary**

Over 1,000 days ago I started lifting daily and have not stopped. I gained size, strength, and stamina. I have not overtrained. The condition of pre-existing injuries has improved and were only aggravated on occasion that I became a knucklehead and did more reps than I knew better to.

Additionally, I worked through my General Gainz training framework, further developing the concept, and many successful training plans in the process. Several are linked in this post. GG improved my training and my client’s training too. I hope this post improves your training similarly.

Disordered,"RIP AND TEAR Program Review, and Discussion of Program Development.  **Introduction**: 

This week I am finishing the last week of my 12 week program, Rip And Tear. This post is going to take a look at the program, my run of it, and then cover some general thoughts about writing programs. 

I like to start every post I write with a brief overview of the sections included in the post so that readers can know what they are getting into and skip to what the want if they don’t have the attention span to read a few pages. 

*The Results*: This section is just a brief look at the results of the 12 weeks, mostly strength focused. 

*The Program*: This section will go over the program itself, with focuses on what it contains/ is designed to accomplish, who should run it, and some of my inspirations. It will also include a link to the spreadsheet for the program. 

*My Run*: This section will look at my experience running the program, what I liked about it, what I changed, and other aspects of my 12 week run. 

*How and Why to Write a Program*: The last section will look at what goes into writing a program. Why you should or should not do it, when you should consider it, and how to go about it. 

**The Results**:
Here are some of my results from the program, which is probably the part of most interest to many of you: 

Squat: [465 x 12]( https://youtu.be/0R6zViHMR0A), [500 x 10]( https://youtu.be/r1E3OkvdVTo),  [405 x 20](https://youtu.be/I7djdphzDK8), [525 x 10 Box]( https://youtu.be/0p_ZoMgI5VM), [655lb Box]( https://youtu.be/hI4P6J2Kb3I)

Bench Press: [365 x 4]( https://youtu.be/PYy_hxCpXLw), [415 x 1]( https://youtu.be/OpG-8_e6NTY)

Deadlift: [700 x 10]( https://youtu.be/TNfy-v5d92M), [800 x 3](https://youtu.be/WYshrJyg1oM). 

Other: [805lb Deadlift 360]( https://youtu.be/_PQjjCKAqjU), [2 x 405lb Deadlift]( https://youtu.be/5Mrn8aDsvKg), [330lb Double Steinborn Squat](https://youtu.be/uQ3RPE2nIec), [365lb Single Leg Deadlift]( https://youtu.be/0zijYggfP-4), [365lb Scott Lift]( https://youtu.be/PYejvw04VTE)

Squat, Bench Press and Deadlift sets are all (or at least almost all) on program. The other lifts are side things I was able to do over the course of the program. 

I bulked for the entire period of the program but do not have specific weight numbers to share as I no longer find tracking my weight to have a purpose. I went from ~265 to ~275, give or take on both sides. 

I do not have before and after pictures, I am at a point where I could count the pounds of muscle I can expect to gain in a year on one hand, so I do not look for difference on a bulk to cut basis. [Here are some pictures from October for reference]( https://imgur.com/a/8NhJXWa). I have a strong sense of what is or is not an effective hypertrophy workout and I judge my success in that area by how many good hypertrophy workouts I can get in. I understand this is both subjective and internal, but you will have to take my word for it when I said that I was able to maintain solid and effective hypertrophy work through the 12 weeks. 

**The Program**: 

Rip And Tear is a 12 week program focused around high frequency, moderate volume, high weight Squat, Bench and Deadlift. [Here is a link to the Spreadsheet]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C4yiw7uNw1LSPlvWMDNnIlHcVQhXMzV4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104236994809501726559&rtpof=true&sd=true). Please do not ask for access to the master copy. Just make a copy for your own use. 

*Features of the program*: 

This is a 4-7 day program. It includes 3 bench days, 3 squat days, and 2 deadlift days a week. It covers programming only for these three lifts. All accessory work and the bulk of the hypertrophy work is up to the user. If you are not comfortable handling this aspect of your training yet this program is not for you. This program will also feature work for the same body parts on back to back days. If you do not have the work capacity or will to do that then this program is not for you.

The program is divided into 3 blocks that are 4 weeks each. Intensity ramps through each block then resets at the beginning of the next block. The primary mechanism of raising intensity is by an increase in weight used. This is coupled with a lowering of reps and increase in sets in most cases. Weights will reach as high as 90% of 1RM for working sets, and will go no lower than 70%. The highest rep range programmed is 7 reps, the lowest is 1. This is a program where you will be working with heavy weight. Weights are based off of a true 1RM. Do not use a training max, do not use an old PR single, pick a weight that you could confidently perform a single for at the beginning of the program. 

Every week except for the first week of each block features an AMRAP (as many reps as possible) set for each of the three lifts during the week. These AMRAPs are not used to moderate progression, progression is locked to your initial 1RM entries. These AMRAPs should be used to push yourself without fear of inflating future week’s weights. At the same time they are ultimately optional, all that is required on the final AMRAP set is the minimum reps. You are encouraged to use your best judgement and regulate yourself as needed. Keyword *needed*, not *wanted*. The final AMRAP of each block is dealers choice on weight. This is a chance for you to push for specific PRs if you so desire. 

Only 4 days a week include programmed lifts. The remaining 3 are listed as rest or hypertrophy days. How these days are used is up to you. I recommend at least 1 of these days be used for upper body hypertrophy work. Ideally a second one be used for extra work on small, quickly recovering muscles (shoulders, calves, arms, etc). I would not recommend using all three for lifting, save at least one for full rest. 3 of the programmed days include suggestions for additional hypertrophy work. You can choose to skip these if wanted, or work a different area. Again I want to stress that all accessory and hypertrophy work is *up to you*. 

*Who/What this Program is for*:

This program is designed to give you a framework for your Squat Bench and Dead (SBD) while leaving you room to still develop yourself through accessory/hypertrophy work. The high frequency on the SBD lifts and heavier weights will improve your specific strength on heavy SBD. If this is something you want, then this program might be for you. If you don’t care about heavy SBD then I hope it goes without saying but this program might not be for you. You should have a strong competency in these three lifts before attempting this program. If your technique is inconsistent or if it puts some stress on the body in an inappropriate way the high number of sets will exacerbate these issues, potentially leading to injury. **This is not a beginner program, this is not an ‘intermediate’ program**. This is program for experienced and competent lifters with a good handle on SBD.  

This program is probably best suited for periods of weight gain. You could potentially run it while cutting with appropriate moderation of your additional work but it goes against [my philosophy on cutting]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qj1ntt/how_to_make_the_most_of_your_cutting_phases_by/?ref=share&ref_source=link). I would not suggest running this program back to back. I run a program like this once a year, and will probably continue to do so for the immediate future. It is a good opportunity to improve your SBD technique, while still leaving enough room and energy for an effective bulk. But it’s a very specific kind of stimulus and if you only train in this manner you are leaving a lot on the table. 

If you want to use an appropriate substitute for any of the three lifts you can. A trap bar deadlift would be fine to swap with the barbell deadlifts. A floor press would be an appropriate swap for the bench press. A leg press would not be an appropriate substitute for the squats. Etc. This lets the program be customized for individual preferences and limitations. You do not need to lift strictly barbell SBD to powerlifting standards for this program to be effective, but again *use your best judgement on substitutions*. If you have to **ask** if something is a reasonable substitute it probably is not. 


*Where the program came from*: 

This program is most heavily inspired by Layne Norton’s PH3. I ran PH3 at the end of 2019 and 2020. I ran it as written in 2019. I ran it with [modifications]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tCi26oYp8GvT7bJuoTGDvbqy8mazemFxD02Nl4xaFRQ/edit?usp=sharing) in 2020. I wrote about my thoughts on PH3 [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/eiz8uf/program_review_ph3/). In short, I felt that it was not suitable as written for the majority of lifters. The only population I thought could effectively keep up the loads and progression were those with substantial muscle and strength, but limited experience with lower rep, high weight SBD. Basically a population that was physically equipped for big lifts but missing the specific technical skill, leading to deflated 1RMs. Granted, *this is exactly who Layne wrote the program for*, so I can’t blame him for that. But I really liked the spirit of the program and wanted to adapt it for myself and a wider population. My first set of changes brought it into line a bit, I was not nearly as beaten up at the end of that run as I was the first, but it still wasn’t quite there. It also did not click with my current philosophy on bulk programming. 

Instead of further tweaking I decided to just take the aspects that I wanted to preserve, high frequency SBD with big weights, and rebuild from the floor up. I kept the core of the program (the 3x4 week structure, the split, and the positioning of the AMRAPS) and dumped pretty much everything else. I changed the percentages, the reps and sets, and removed the AMRAP based progression scheme. I also drew inspiration from Greg Nuckols 28Free Program Builder, with the increased weight coupled with lower reps but higher sets, as I really enjoyed that set up. 

I should also credit whoever was the original author of the PH3 spreadsheet on LiftVault, as I used the bones of that spreadsheet for this one. 

I credit DOOM for the name of the program. 

**My Run**: 

*Accessory/Hypertrophy*: 
I ran 2 additional hypertrophy days, one Upper-body and one Arm day on Days 7 and 4 respectively, with Day 2 as a full rest day. I initially took days from John Meadows Gamma Bomb for hypertrophy but quickly just started performing them how I wanted, using the GB workouts as inspiration only. 

On programmed days my additional work would look something like this: 2-3 sets of 2-5 movements, usually super-setted or giant-setted. I performed some arm work on Day 1, Leg work on Day 4, and Upper body on Day 5. I performed a more intensive Leg day on day 6. I did not keep movements consistent week to week, I performed whatever I was feeling like each day. 

*Changes, Choices, and Modifications:*
-I started with 585/405/785 S/B/D 1RMs.

-I cut the programmed squats on Day 6 pretty quickly. They did not really mesh well with how I wanted to run the rest of my hypertrophy leg days and hypertrophy took the priority over a bit if extra technical practice. 

-I skipped the deads on Day 1 as needed. Sometimes my back was just too fatigued for my heavy forward lean low bar and deadlifts back to back. I do not really need the technical practice on deadlifts, and saw little value in forcing uncomfortable clunky reps. 

-I took AMRAP sets either to PR or attempted PR, or to the minimum. I reasoned that if I was not in good enough shape to push for my best I was better off controlling my fatigue so I could keep up my hypertrophy work. 

-At one point I tweaked a knee on failing an off program lift. I skipped one sessions worth of squat and dead, then used block squats to just above parallel for the remainder of the program. 

-After the 415lb bench PR I felt a small pinch between my pec and my shoulder at the bottom of heavier bench reps. I subbed in floor presses from this point onwards. 

(I want to note that both of these injuries were basically gone in ~2 weeks and had a total impact of making me use some variations. Stop being terrified of injuries folks. Shit happens when you are trying hard). 

-I did a *lot* of off program nonsense over the 12 weeks. This seems to have a pretty minimal negative impact on my training. 

*Additional Notes and Thoughts*: 
During this bulk I consumed ~6,000 calories a day. I cut out my 5k rows the first week due to a head cold and never reintroduced them. I walked 6 miles with my dog most days, with that being reduced 3 miles or 0 miles on very cold days as I realized that I was barely gaining weight regardless of all the food, so there was little reason to try and expend more energy. 

Days 1, 3 and 5 I lifted in my basement. Days 4, 6, and 7 I lifted at the gym. I lift from ~9-11am, some days taking less some days taking more. 

I felt that every day’s programmed weights were challenging, but doable. Even on a bad day I could complete my reps if I put my mind to it. On the original program, near the end there was stuff I just could not do. Even during the first week where I had some very stuffy sinuses and a very dry throat I managed, including the first squat PR listed above. 

I think that I did betray my bulk philosophy a bit. My goals should have been primarily on the hypertrophy work, making sure that I left energy for these sets every day. But there were many instances where I had the potential to set a squat or deadlift PR and taking that set took the edge of my subsequent work. All the nonsense work also probably did not help. But ultimately I *wanted* do these things and that is what matters. 

I was very happy with how well box squats and floor presses, two movements I had never done before, slotted in when I needed them. The longer I workout the more I find that no specific movement is really needed and that expanding your horizons to try new variants and movement patterns ultimately pays off into similar lifts. I used to throw myself against barbell squat, bench and deadlift, terrified of any back slide. I kept the same training style and focused on the same accessory movements. This culminated in my least productive training year plus, where my SBD total increased 15lbs, or maybe even 10lbs with an arbitrary chip of a squat PR. It sucked, I was not excited to lift, I was not progressing, I worried that I was just done getting better. Then I sucked it up and tried a totally different type of program. I was forced to make more changes to how I worked out by the pandemic. I started trying other variants and goofing around with nonsense lifts. I took breaks from focusing on barbell SBD and it massively paid off. Since that plateau I have added almost 200lbs to my total and am confident I have room to grow on all three of the lifts. I realize I have gone on a bit of a tangent here but I think it is a valuable perspective. No matter what your goals are, or what you think that they are right now, a wider scope of training style, movement selection and programming methodology will help you. It’s good for your original goals, lets you experience new things you didn’t know that you liked and helps with training longevity, both physically and mentally. [I expand on these ideas a bit here, to plug some more reading.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qj1ntt/how_to_make_the_most_of_your_cutting_phases_by/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

I don’t think anything needs to be changed before I run it next year, which I still plan to do. I am comfortable changing things as necessary, which means I can adapt to my needs in the moment anyways. Seeing as this program is directed to experienced lifters, I think that if you run it you can probably make changes within reason as well. Just take ownership, if you want to change something make sure you are confident about it. If you aren’t, you probably should not be modifying your programming. 

**How and Why to Write a Program**: 

This last section I want to cover some of my thoughts on writing your own programming. A lot of people *want* to do their own programming, but I do not think most of them *should*. If you are in the category of people who can successfully manage it, I’ll give some general ideas on it. 
My first outing in writing my own programming was the plateau year I described above. I ran something I wrote for over a year and I ended up with jack shit to show for it.
 I had just finished almost three years of random bro split into nSuns 531 into nSuns CAP3, and I felt that I had outpaced both programs, but did not want to shift to something totally different. So I took a very loose understanding of 531BBB, and hit it with a hammer until it was a pile of scrap that covered 6 days a week. I did not know what I was doing, why I was doing it, and I had only every experienced one flavor of programming. Turns out that 531BBB is not meant to be a 6 day program. Doing 531 sets + 5x10 + accessories 6 times a week, doubling up on SBD and cutting out OHP is not a good programming decision. 
But I was not going to let that stop me, I was going to run that ship fully aground over the course of a year and wonder why I was not getting anywhere. I cannot stress enough that I did not know what I was doing and that I had zero business writing a program after only three years of training and in only one style. *Do not be like me*. This is not me telling you that I am special and can write programs and you are not so you can’t. This is me explaining my own personal failings in that endeavor so that you might understand why it might not be a good idea for you. 

So what has changed between then and now? Well now I have another 4ish years of experience with a variety of programs, including my failed program. I have a much firmer grasp of what does and does not work for me, and what my training philosophies are. I have much more nuanced ideas of what my goals are and how I can reach them. I am thinking in programming blocks, not in just in perpetual consistent training. I am much more experienced and have a much greater knowledge of how things work, and how they don’t work. The only thing that can give you the above is time under, over, around or otherwise in the vicinity the bar or other heavy object. I do not believe you can effectively ‘study’ these things from a theoretical perspective, particularly when it comes to you as an individual. 

What is the best way to accumulate this experience? Train with a large variety of someone else’s programs. Try to pick programs that are radically different, or at very least from different people in different disciplines. Even as I tell you this there are plenty of areas I have not looked into yet. Even if you want to be like me and run programs that generally gravitate around SBD, you should at least run a lot of different SBD based programs in order to broaden your perspectives on how to train these movements. No two experienced coaches are going to have the same outlook, and by experiencing their programming you gain the benefit of their unique approach to training. As you gather this firsthand experience, pay attention to what you like and don’t like. What works for you and what does not. These are the aspects you are going to want to take, or leave, in your future programming. 

So now you have run at least 10 different programs, you’ve been at this for quite a few years and have a pretty solid grasp on how you operate, and *you have results to show for it*. Are you ready to write a program? Maybe. *Should you?* Well that is a totally different answer. Ask yourself these questions: 

*”Why are you writing a program”*: The answer probably should not be ‘Because I just want to’. I can’t stop you if this is your only reason, but it’s not really a good one. There are people better at this than you, and they are offering up their programs. You will almost certainly be better off just picking one that aligns with your needs and using that. A better answer to this question is ‘Because nothing I have found quite meets my current needs’. Now you are getting somewhere. Generic programs are just that, generic. This does not mean that they are bad, but it means that they are meeting relatively broad needs so as to apply to a wide audience. A custom program does not need to do this, it can focus on as narrow and obscure a goal as you want it to. It can be tailored to your needs and wants. Why did I write Rip and Tear? Because I wanted to run PH3 again, but PH3 was not really compatible with me. No other program that I knew of had the parts of PH3 that I wanted but with more compatibility. 

*”Can you just modify an existing program”*: As a follow-up, if you have a unique need, can you fulfill it by just taking a program and making some minor changes? As far as I am concerned there is no shame in working off someone’s programming homework and changing it just enough that the teacher does not notice. This was my first step, as mentioned above. I tried modifying PH3 before writing Rip and Tear and still didn’t quite get it where I wanted it. 
*”What is your program going to do, and how”*: Even if you have identified that no program can meet your needs, with or without modification, you still need to be able to explain to yourself how your proposed program will meet those needs. How are you going to structure your program so that it helps you reach your goals? What is is going to look like, in broad strokes, and why are those strokes going to lead towards your success? If you can’t explain why your program will work, it probably isn’t going to do so. In my case this was an easy question to answer. I wanted to lifted heavy SBD a lot. So all my program had to do was contain a lot of heavy SBD sets. If your goal is more specific or based on an actual result, you might have a harder time with this question.

*”What are you basing your program on?”*: I don’t think that anyone should just sit down with a blank piece of paper and completely create a brand new program from scratch. The experience you are leveraging to write this program came from other programs. *Use those*. Take chunks of other programs shamelessly. Nothing is original, even if you do make up everything in your program it’s still going to end up copying parts of someone’s programming. Don’t make more work for yourself, work with the enormous body if existing programming. As I have also mentioned above I drew from both PH3 and 28Free when writing Rip and Tear. 

*”What are you going to call your program”*: All the good programs have cool names based on cool shit like superheros, heavy metal, giant robots, or puns. If you are going to write a program you have to name it something suitably intense to properly represent how powerful it is. I named my program Rip And Tear [because it’s intense]( https://youtu.be/NgAm664NloA) [as shit]( https://youtu.be/zZMg9ryeWOw). 
If you have established that you can make a program, should make a program, and know what’s going into it, here are a few final thoughts:

-Everything does not need to have to have a precise reasoning. I just picked percentages because they looked reasonable. I picked 2.5% jumps because it seemed like a good number. Why did I up the jump to 5% for the 3rd week? I accidently typed it that way in week three and decided that it looked alright to me. This was all totally fine because the precise percentages don’t really matter that much. A little lower and I would probably just get higher AMRAPs and have more juice for accessories. A little  higher and it would be the opposite. Neither is a big deal. 

-Along similar lines you should have a good sense of what your program is going to do, and a reasonable sense of how it’s going to do that, but the precise mechanisms aren’t super relevant. You don’t need to stress over having a double undulating bilateral progression scheme or a reverse pyramid step back looping progression, or whatever the influencers pretending to be eggheads are talking about. Is the program moving generally forward in some manner? That’s probably good enough. You should know several progression schemes that you like from the experiences you gathered. Just pick one. Adding specific movements to your program? Just pick some, I promise the choice between a banded floor press versus a chained block press wont make or break your programming. Focus on the large scale, not the small scale. Your foundation matters, what color you paint the walls does not.  

-Don’t be afraid to audible. If you realize a third of the way in that something is not working change it. You aren’t going ‘off program’, you wrote the damn thing, you are *editing* it. If you have the experience necessary to write a program you have the experience necessary to make judgement calls to change things mid-program. Frankly the later requires less experience than the former. 

**Conclusions**:

I think I have covered everything I wanted to here. Again this is clocking in at north of 4k words so thank you for reading this far if you did. I will answer any questions in the comments to the best of my abilities. I am planning to work through a radically different custom program in the spring and will hopefully work out a similar writeup when I complete that."

A common concern is that quantitatively tracking dietary intake may give rise to disordered eating. A new randomized controlled trial casts doubt on this idea, fueling optimism for people who want to more actively manage their diet without unintended consequences.

**Key Points:**

1. In the presently reviewed study[^(1)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34427188/), 200 female college students who did not closely monitor their diet were randomly assigned to one month of diet tracking with MyFitnessPal or no intervention (control).
2. The researchers did not observe significant negative effects on eating disorder risk, anxiety, depressive symptoms, body satisfaction, quality of life, eating behaviors, physical activity, screen time, or other forms of weight-related self-monitoring. 
3. For individuals without a current or previous eating disorder diagnosis, tracking with a diet app did not negatively impact psychological outcomes or increase eating disorder risk. On the other hand, the mere act of tracking did not significantly improve other health-related behaviors."

Neutral,"When do you return to exercising after Covid?  Hi Reddit, it’s 10th day after I was tested with Covid (yeah, got it on New Year) with mild symptoms. I still have some coughing but otherwise feel much better.

Before it, I was training with different levels of effort for around 2 years and strictly followed bodyweight RR for last 2 months with good progression (from my point of view).

My question is when and how to resume working out. I think it may be an interesting discussion especially with this new variant as a lot of people either already went through this or will go soon. 

Some sources [1] tell that you need to wait at least 10-14 days after all symptoms are gone, but it sounds too harsh to me. Others [2,3] suggest for at least a week (also after all symptoms are gone). But again, minor coughing usually persist pretty long after Covid and I’m not sure if you should wait after it’s completely gone or a week after fever is gone is enough. 

I desperately want to resume these fun activities but afraid of making things worse to me. So, want to know if anyone has some experience/knowledge in returning to fitness after the illnesses. And what is the general rule of thumb of the community (I’m not seeking for a medical advice, just want to discuss with the people here their experience and issues in returning to fitness)

Neutral,"Build ‘Real-World Strength’ With Uneven Load Weight Training  Hey guys!

I came across a really interesting article and I am wondering if someone has done this type of training before, or what some people's thoughts are. 


To try to condense the article, it suggests using different weights to create uneven loads. It gives this example. ""When selecting your weights for off-balance weight training, start by making sure the heavier side has 5 to 10 pounds less than normal for unsupported movements (meaning not laying on the ground or on a bench). Then subtract another 5 to 10 pounds for the other side. For example, if your Walking Dumbbell Lunge is normally performed with 40-pound dumbbells in each hand, I’d start with a 30-pound dumbbell in one hand and a 20 or 25-pound dumbbell in the other hand. Then, and this is crucial, you want to make sure you perform an equal number of reps with the dumbbells swapped. So if you start with the heavier dumbbell in your right hand and the lighter dumbbell in your left hand, you need to ensure you’re performing an equal number of reps with the heavier dumbbell in your left hand and the lighter dumbbell in your right hand"". 

The justification for this type of training is that in the real world we dont deal with perfectly balanced weights, so training this way helps us in a more practical sense. It also discusses stabilizing muscles. 

Anyways, I'm interested in playing around with this type of training, but just wanted to see if someone has done this before and/or what are some people's thoughts.

r/Fitness is a **self-help** community.  Before asking questions, you are expected to have made a good faith effort to find an answer on your own and show it by explaining where you looked, what you found, and why it wasn't enough.  We ask you to respect that the people answering your questions are volunteering their time, knowledge, and experience.

To help answer your questions, get you started, or help you continue on your fitness journey, we have complied a comprehensive Wiki and FAQ.  [**https://thefitness.wiki/**](https://thefitness.wiki/) is the result of community discussions on best practice, expert opinion, emerging science, and general know-how from those who have made fitness their lifestyle or profession.

# The r/Fitness wiki is moderator funded, and this year we are asking for your help to make it community funded.

Domain registration and hosting costs over $500 per year, but it is important to us to house this resource off-platform.  Why?  To keep it ad-free and prevent any undue sponsorship or marketing influence, to keep it organized, to ensure content and links to outside resources work regardless of app or browser, to enable proper search functionality, and to make sure it's available during site outages.  **If you'd like to contribute**, you can anonymously donate any amount via [an Amazon e-gift card](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-1_US_Email-eGift-Card/dp/B004LLIKVU) to [purplespengler@gmail.com](mailto:purplespengler@gmail.com).

* [The r/Fitness Wiki and FAQ.](https://thefitness.wiki/)  Most questions that people come to r/Fitness with can be answered directly by the Wiki and FAQ or by applying the information found in it.  It will always be the best first place to look for answers.  Moderators or the community can help direct you to the right information if you have trouble finding it.
* [Searching past threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/search?q=&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all)  r/Fitness has over a decade of discussion threads that are very likely to have answers to your questions if our Wiki and FAQ does not.  Remember when searching that fitness and exercise are not fast moving topics, and even discussions that are several years old are going to be relevant today.
* [Google.](https://www.google.com/)  Yes, really, or your preferred search engine.  Google excels at being a source of answers for common fitness and exercise questions including exercise alternatives or progressions, meal plan and food options, equipment or product reviews, and so on.
* Yourself.  Many questions we see come down to a matter of personal preference or can be answered by ""it depends.""  You should check in with yourself before asking the community to decide something for you.

Neutral,"First post! Do you manage to exercise alone?  Hello! 

As mentioned, this is my first post here, so I’ll just jump right in to it and explain.

I (male, 20’s) do a lot of different activities (mostly running, cycling, skating on ice, crossfit. High intensity is Key), but recently i’ve lost interest in doing these kind of activities alone. In fact, I think its straight up boring just having to do these things by myself. I want to share my training experience with somebody, talk about the training session, and so on. 
Its just about having someone interested in the same kind of things as me. If i want to do a hike in the mountains, i usually have to prepare myself that its just going to be me.

I have a girlfriend, but she doesn’t want to be involved in these high intensity training sessions. With her, i usually just walk. I also have some friends that I ask if want to join me, but they never want to.

I’m not even an extreme kind of training guy, i’m just average and want to be in physical activity. When I first started training, i didn’t care about being alone. But Now i think about training as some kind of experience, rather than some kind of personal goal. 

I dont how to solve this. 

QUESTIONS: Do any of you struggle with the same?How do you manage to exercise alone? 

I’d love to have your take on this."

I looked all over for a spreadsheet of a (free) program Paul Carter outlined some years ago but couldn't find one, so I made one!

I've included the article Paul wrote and the link to the google sheet that you can make a copy of to edit yourself.

I found the article's tips very helpful and having run the program through once a year ago I got my OHP up to 135. I'm going to run it again soon and try to get up to 175.

Neutral,"How to New Years Resolution - Stronger by Science podcast discusses goal setting and behavior change  **Tl;dr - For maximum success, create a hierarchy of goals and approach them with good vibes.**

[LINK TO EPISODE](https://sbspod.com/episodes/goal-setting-and-behavior-change)

New! 1/3/21 - [Link to accompanying article](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/goal-setting/)

Tis the season for New Year's Resolutions (NYRs), and [the most recent Stronger by Science podcast](https://sbspod.com/episodes/goal-setting-and-behavior-change)  came through with evidence based tips on how to best set fitness goals.  And before you dismiss January 1 as insignificant or primed for failure, SBS shares that rates of success for NYRs aren't that bad.  Six months into the year 69% of people in one study were claiming success, and 55% were still claiming it after 12 months.  ^(19:50)  Additionally, the ""fresh start effect"" that the new year offers is real and able to be leveraged. ^(24:00)

So what does the science say about setting ourselves up for success with NYRs or any other goal?  Establish a hierarchy of goals that all support each other.  ^(30:50)

* Start with a **SUPERORDINATE** goal. Have a big, value- or identity-based goal as an anchor that will provide your ""why.""  It should explain why all your smaller goals matter and act as a motivating force.
* Next have **INTERMEDIATE** goals.  These will be a little less vague and give you a clear route to accomplishing your big goal while still allowing flexibility in the path you take to get there.
* Finally, have **SUBORDINATE** goals.  This is where your SMART goals live for all of you trembling in anticipation of seeing your favorite acronym.  Your subordinate goals set up what you're going to do, how you'll do it, and when it will get done.  These are the goals you interact with on a daily basis.  Because you've set your Intermediate and Superordinate goals, these can be adjusted as needed to find any of the many routes to success.

You've got your hierarchy.  What's next?  SBS reviews what the evidence says will help you meet those goals.

* Identify your specific obstacles, and set your intermediate and subordinate goals to target them.  ^(49:50)  Set an if/then plan for when you will implement behaviors that lead to your goals.  ^(1:23:53)
* Plan not only your actions but your coping when things go wrong.  Challenges will always arise, and you can think through how you'll address them ahead of time.  ^(1:29:20)
* Utilize approach goals instead of avoidant goals.  ""I will eat more vegetables"" instead ""I will not have candy.""  Approach goals are associated with positive emotions and greater well-being, and the evidence supports it's a more successful route to take.  ^(52:50)
* Pair a delayed gratification behavior with something enjoyable in the moment.  For example, listen to your favorite true crime podcast only while you're out for a walk.  This ""temptation bundling"" adds an incentive for your goal based behavior.  ^(1:25:30)
* Piggyback new habits onto ones already established.  ^(1:28:17) 
* Allow yourself flexibility both with diet ^(1:03:34) and other behaviors.  Having some ""slack with a cost"" leads to increased persistence. ^(1:18:00)

One common theme that ran through the goal setting and the achievement strategies was this - NO BAD VIBES.  Setting goals properly and with things you can control will help you succeed.  There is no need for shame or the idea that failure or setbacks are a personal failing. ^(51:30)  Good vibe approaches work.

Neutral,"One Rep Max Questions  Hey all!

I have some very limited experience in lifting; I have followed programs sporadically and worked with a trainer for a month here and there but I would say I'm effectively still a beginner.

The program I've just started is based on %ages of ORM. The trainer I was working with previously actually recommended it.

My question is when and how I should calculate ORM. I have a squat cage at home as well as an Olympic bar and dumbbells, but I don't have anyone to lift with and am kind of nervous to try maxing out myself. I also feel like until I have someone there for safety I won't go to max. I need to get ORM for most of the major Barbell/Dumbbell exercises. I'm also not sure if the dumbbells I have will go high enough for me to max out (30 per hand max).

My questions are:

1. Do I do it on a normal workout day? Should I do it on a rest day and count that as my accessory/cardio work?
2. Is there a safe way to do it alone with safety bars, etc? Or should I just schedule a time with a friend who can spot. Would it be better to get into an actual gym for this process?
3. How often should I try to update this/repeat the process? I'm sure over time its going to change.
4. How should I handle ORM for exercises that don't use weights (band, bodyweight like dips, etc)?
5. What are the other ways people determine workload? Seems like there are a lot of different ideas/programs out there. I think its not so tough to determine which exercises to do but how do you know when you've worked enough or too much?

In any case, I am going to be sticking with this program to completion before I start looking into 5. 

Thanks everyone!"
Disordered,"What Is the Best Method of Cardio for Fat Burning?  #[Link to Article](http://www.lookgreatnaked.com/blog/what-is-the-best-method-of-cardio-for-fat-burning/)

In this blog post from Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, he summarizes a recent meta-analysis his team performed comparing HIIT and moderate intensity exercise on fat loss:

[Slow and Steady, or Hard and Fast? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Studies Comparing Body Composition Changes between Interval Training and Moderate Intensity Continuous Training](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4663/9/11/155/htm)

He notes a previous meta-analysis came to a different conclusion but has since been retracted after several oddities were found.  (Which, as an aside, [seems to be a thing](https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/17/exercise-researcher-earns-more-retractions-as-investigations-mount/) plaguing Brazilian research lately.)  

The new paper is open source and worth a read, but Brad sums it up nicely by saying:

>Take-home: We can confidently state that HIIT cannot be considered a “magic bullet” for fat loss; MICT is equally as effective for achieving this outcome.

Still, the data is not without its limitations and Brad does a good job laying those out and further explaining how different protocols may lead to different results.  Then concluding with a message I don't think can be repeated enough:

>Research can help to guide exercise prescription, but ultimately you must determine the best course of action based on individual needs, abilities, and goals."

Disordered,"Sled push to increase speed and acceleration  Hey all! For reference, I am a squash player. The length of the ""track"" is 10meters so every 10m i need to turn the sled around. So one ""round"" is 10m

I have been experimenting for 3 weeks with the sled push. Since I train legs 3x a week, that means a total of 9 sessions with it. Trying out different weights, distance and rest periods. My primary goal is to increase accelaration and my secondary goal is to increase leg endurance, espeicially for squash. My experience with it, I love it. It feels great and I think it is a decent exercise combining regular squats, box jumps and lunges. 

My problem is that Im not sure how to program this movement. I have thought it through and I think I can do 2 heavy days and one lighter day. The heavy days being two rounds of max effort, and the lighter days would be a bit longer perhaps 6-10rounds. The heavy days having the goal of increasing acceleration and the lighter day more of an endurance builder.  If you ask why I chose those distances, yes I pulled them out from my ass. 

So my question is, do  you program this on max distance covered in a x amount of time, or a predetermined distance fastest as possible? If you think the former, then for how many minutes if the goal is acceleration and for how many minutes for endurance? And if you think the latter, then how far should the distance on the heavy days and on the lighter days. 

Follow up questions, should i also include reverse sled pulls? Like instead of pushing, you go backwards.


Tl;dr: how to program sled push

Edit 2: After reading the comments I will adding the sled push to build leg endurance and not speed. I will be cheking the sprint subreddit for that"

Neutral,"CrossFit & Strength Accessory Program  Hi all!

Just looking for a bit of advice really.

I’ve been off and on with gyms for the past few years and then when covid hit, really got back into going to the gym again, messy breakup, big focus on myself!

My new partner is really into CrossFit, so I thought I would give it a go, and fell in love aswell. My main concern about a standard gym was me not actually taking the time and effort to do any cardio, having asthma I was always scared too, but doing this has pushed me out of my comfort zone.

Anyway, the coaches have great WODs programmed in and do to Oly session on the weekends. But I really miss doing some good old strength training to go alongside it. I was doing a PPL at the time, but the CrossFit gym doesn’t have all the same equipment so I thought I would just focus mainly on the CrossFit and metcon. 

Now I want to get my strength back to similar/better level so I’ve been looking at strength programs again, but I don’t want to spend hours in the gym as each class with the warm up is roughly 45/60 mins. 

Can anyone help or may if had a similar situation in the past and what they did to have CF and a strength program side by side? I was looking at simple 5/3/1 but wasn’t too sure if it was enough.

Thanks all!


TLDR- I’m looking for a strength program  (5/3/1-PPL - just on a faster scale)to go side by side with programmed CrossFit workouts."

[Progress pic/TDEE estimate/Weight Loss Graph](https://imgur.com/a/i2K3eSO)

**Diet:**

Calories:

Setted the goal of losing 0,9% bodyweight per week, eated the calories that would cause this given the amount of exercise I was doing, check TDEE estimate to see calories and weight variation.

Macros:

Sticked to 2,2-2,8g/kg/day of protein cause of the satiety benefits instead of the 1,6-2,2 range.

For fats I stayed near 0,5g/kg/day and minimizing saturated fats, and the rest I completed with carbs and sometimes alcohol.

I weighted myself every morning right after waking up and using the bathroom, only supplements I took were creatine monohydrate and a big cup of coffe before workouts.

**Exercise:**

Routine:

I sticked with Push-Legs-Pull since I went to the gym 6 times a week. Chose my exercises based on the concept of SFR(stimulus to fatigue ratio) since those were my first 6 months in the gym the first 2 were more experimentation and seeing what worked best for me but from there I sticked with those:

PUSH:

1. CHEST PRESS
2. SHOULDER PRESS
3. INCLINE DUMBELL BENCH PRESS
4. MACHINE ASSISTED DIP
5. CABLE TRICEPS PUSHDOWN
6. HANGING LEG RAISES

LEGS:

1. LEG PRESS
2. DUMBELL STIFF LEG DEADLIFT
3. THIGH ABDUCTOR
4. SUMO SQUAT
5. LEG EXTENSION
6. CALF PRESS
7. AB CRUNCH MACHINE

PULL:

1. MACHINE ASSISTED PULL UP
2. SEATED MACHINE ROW
3. UPRIGHT ROW
4. BARBELL CURL
5. MACHINE BICEP CURL
6. TWISTING SIT UP

I did 2 Mesocycles with a deload in the middle of them (it's the green week on TDEE estimate) for sets and reps I started lightly at 2 sets each exercise and 3 Reps in reserve in first week of the meso and increased it to 5 sets each exercise and 0 Reps in reserve in the last week of the meso. At the first 3 days of the week I focused on progressing load and in the last 3 days of the week I focused progressing reps, that made me stay in the 8-12 rep range for the first 3 days and 10-20 rep range for the last 3 days.

This part was really auto regulated I didn't increase every exercise to 5 sets I just increased the volume enough to give me greats pumps, burn in high reps sets, tension in low rep sets and recovering fast enough to not be sore on the next day I trained that same muscle group and ofc started relatively light and made it unsustainably hard in the last week.

Alright, I imagine that all of the above are pretty usual things that most of folks probably do, now I also done two other things that I think helped me a lot!

First: I made use of 2 days Refeeds based on a study that saw greater muscle retention, I putted those on Thursday and Friday to get the beginning of high rep half of the week and since on Sunday I rested it made possible to increase volume while still being able to recover properly.

Second: Only cardio I did was taking steps, A LOT of steps. Steps are really inefficient from a time pov but when you factor the fatigue it generates its really small you can burn so much calories without hurting NEAT or training that is completely broken. I started by taking 10000 steps daily but ramped it up to 20000 steps near the end of the diet. You can check on TDEE that I was eating 2150kcal and still losing tons of weight in the end cause of the high volume training and high step count.

I read the following books to help me guide the methodology I used:

1. Art of Lifting - Greg Nuckols
2. Science of Lifting - Greg Nuckols
3. Fat Loss Forever - Layne Norton
4. The Pyramid of Muscle - Eric Helms
5. Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy - Brad Schoenfeld

Next on my list are the Renaissance Periodization books since Dr. Mike Israetel seems an amazing author.

Thanks for reading if you made it to here! My future plan now its to maintain and deload for the next 2 weeks and start a mass gaining phase at the rate of 0,5% bodyweight per week for 6 months while lifting heavy."

**Background Info** 

You may remember me from my previous [*“OVERTRAINED”* post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where I deadlifted 605-750+ every day for 50 days, I also have written about a few other programs and misadventures such as “Simple Jack’d”, “Smarathlov”, and then there is always that one LP lingering around… 

  

Shortly after my deadlift every day experiment I competed in a powerlifting meet, where [I deadlifted 325kg / 716.5 pounds to set a new state record in the Men’s 220lb weight class](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/qa0s1z/i_broke_my_states_deadlift_record_yesterday_at_34/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), an increase of 50lb over the previous record, and narrowly missed a 749 pull on my third attempt when my thumb tore. 

  

After the meet I just took some time to have fun and train by feel for a bit. 

  

--- 

**A new challenger appears** 

  

In late October, I was chatting with a friend who is a successful bodybuilding coach, and we were talking about progress on lifts, and worthwhile goals to pursue in the offseason. 

  

He challenged me to race him to a 405x5 bench. 

  

At the time my bench was languishing around ~350x4 / 405x1 after months of neglect. I figured this would be a fun goal, and something that would take me 3-6+ months to achieve, but then he added a deadline… January 1. 

  

I don’t like to lose, and when I have a goal in mind, I get hyper-focused on it. So taking what I have learned from past experiments with high frequency, I decided I was going to bench every single day until I hit 405x5 

  

Over the years I have experimented with many different setups for high frequency training. From my earliest attempts of mimicking the *""Bulgarian Method""* of maxing out every day, to *""Simple Jack’d’s""* more reserved setup of a 6 rep daily minimum, I have learned a lot.  

  

**During DLED I kept things simple.**

1)	Deadlift 3 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Deadlift 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

That was it, and it worked great. However, shortly after the experiment was over, my maxes started dropping off quite quickly.  

The Daily Deadlifting had succeeded in getting me a stronger 1RM, but it lacked the volume to drive longer term, sustainable growth. I had essentially just PEAKED my deadlift. 

  

I wanted to try something a bit different for bench. 

  
---

  

**ENTER:** **The** **P**ress **E**very **D**ay **s**ystem (aka **PEDs**) 

  

PEDs is essentially a combination of Simple Jack’d and DLED. It incorporates a bit more variation, and structure to SJ, and a lot more volume to DLED. It was set up as follows 

1)	Bench 4 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Bench 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	Bench 40/30/20/10+ Reps for Volume – EVERY OTHER DAY 

4)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

  

So with a 405 bench max, and a 275 incline bench max, a single day might look something like this: 

* Paused Bench - 2 sets of 2 reps at 345 

* Incline Bench – 5 sets of 8 reps at 195 

* 1-2 assistance lifts. 

And that’s it. Its simple, straight forward, and you move on with your day. 

  

You can find [the **full program outline** I set up, as well as a log of all my sets/reps, and a third sheet to show it in terms of training percentages here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IG5LnMSOedRzV8obf5GqxBDy5tUzRbh4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105219797917450253924&rtpof=true&sd=true)if you are interested in that, the log also contains hyperlinks to videos from each day.

**The Race** 

I was starting the race with a clean 1rm of 405, and a 4RM of ~350ish 

  
* On Day 2 my challenger hit 365x3 to take the lead. 
* On Day 5 I tried to bench 375x4, but was only able to grind out 3 reps. 

  375x3 was a true max here, an e1rm of ~413. This still put me back in the lead by a small margin... for about 5 minutes. 

Later that very same day [my challenger hit 385x4](https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/qnsmb9/175x4_today_i_was_told_these_slides_give_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and blew my 375x3 out of the water, retaking the lead. 

...however,  this would be the last time he'd take the lead. 

  

* Day 11 - I tied up the race with 385x4 but that 4th rep was a huge grind. 

* Day 15 - I hit a nice clean 435 paused bench. This did not go toward the competition,  but still a great milestone. 

* **Day 17 - I finally re-took the lead, with a big 396x4 bench**.   
This brought my e1rm up to 448, a 35lb increase over day 5. 

* Day 19 - was my first attempt to rep out 405, and I got 3 reps, with a huge grind to finish the 3rd rep, and a small PR.   

* Day 21 - I took out the slingshot And hit 408x7, which was awesome. 

* Day 22 - I hit a 454 paused bench for an all time paused 1rm PR 

At this point my daily minimum had progressed from 4 reps at 345, to 4 reps at 385, and it was becoming quite heavy and harder to recover from, so I decided to stop pushing singles, since that's what drives my daily minimums up. 

* Day 23 - Another rep out at 405, this time brought me to 405x4, for a big PR.    

  
For a few days after that I hit minimums, and focused on setting PRs on some variations. During this time I hit 

* 396 Larsen Press 

* 253 OHP 

* 404x2 Duffalo Bench 

* 315x2 incline bench 

  
I also tweaked something in my pec during this time, so I spent a few days hitting lower RPE sets at 385+ 

* Day 30 - I benched 421x3, getting my e1rm into the 460+ range for the first time. Only 9 pounds away from the required e1rm for 405x5. 

* Day 31 - I hit 385x4 again, but this time it was with a close grip, and the bar moved so easily, despite my pec causing some pretty serious discomfort.  

  

That night I ate all the lasagna on planet earth. 

  

The next morning I woke up, and asked my friend /u/nrllifts to give me a number between 2 and 6. (Something we do once in a while to give each other rep goals) 

He said 5 

I told him that my goal would be 400x5 to attempt a new e1rm... 

But he rightfully shamed me. 

>>""I mean that would be cool and all. But who does 400 when 405 is right there..."" 

So.. on day 32, I went for the goal, and [**Hit 405x5**](https://imgur.com/a/671Hrku) **with ease.** 

  

  

After hitting my end goal, I decided to just push on for another 2.5 weeks of benching to see what other PRs I could scrape together. At this point, I updated my goals to  

* 455+ bench 

* 255+ OHP 

* 500+ Slingshot 

  

And despite coming down with a nasty cold/virus, which completely ruined week 5, I still managed to hit my daily minimums each day of 385x4, and hit all three of my new stretch goals, with a [**465 bench**](https://imgur.com/a/8h8m3wT), [**270 OHP**](https://imgur.com/a/TX9XMyE), and a [**501 slingshot**](https://imgur.com/a/o03WJ3y) bench. 

  
---

  

**Data / Summary** 

  

Overall I hit 901 reps over 70% in 50 days, for a total volume of 263,872 lb. That's means the average day worked out to be approximately 18 reps at 295, when accounting for all variations. 

  

The lowest daily weight I benched was 345, the highest was 465, and 501 with the slingshot. 

Those Reps broke down in the following way: 

* Flat Bench: 250 Reps (28%).   

* OHP: 195 Reps (22%).   

* Incline Bench: 122 Reps (14%).   

* Close Grip Bench: 167 Reps (19%).   

* Larsen Press: 138 Reps (15%).   

* Slingshot Bench: 29 Reps (3%).

**Specific Discussion** 

In my previous ***”OVERTRAINED”*** post, I touched on a couple important topics, they were: 

* Using Variation to combat Fatigue 

* Diet, Sleep, Recovery  

* CNS fatigue and overtraining 

* Pain and Injury 

I still stand by everything I stated in those sections, and would suggest that anyone interested in taking on high frequency training, or just learning more about it, give those a read [in the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

  

For this post however, I want to shift my focus a little bit more to the “HOW” of daily training. Things I have learned about pushing a lift OVER and OVER again, to break through plateaus and set PR’s 

---
  

**Choosing your maxes** 

When you start out a program like this, you need to be conservative. I had to hit 4 reps at 85% of my 1rm every day, and follow that up with a ton of volume. So with that in mind 1RMs should be: 

RECENT: Something you’ve hit in the last couple weeks, not something you did 6 months ago at the end of a bulk. 

CLEAN: in the weeks leading up to this program, I had benched 415 and 425, but both times were Touch-and-Go, and both times my hips came off the bench. These reps would not count in competition, so they didn’t count toward a recent CLEAN 1RM. Pick something where you can keep your form nearly perfect. 

For variations, you should also try to pick RECENT and CLEAN maxes, but if you haven’t done a variation in a while, take a ballpark guess, and then round down. Can you hit 315 flat? Well, I’m sure you can do ~60% of that on an incline, so start at 185. If the first day is easy, blow a rep PR out of the water, and then adjust going forward.  

  

**Its better to start too light, than too heavy, you can always go UP.**  

---
  

**Approaching each day** 

Once you have your 1RM’s selected, you can start training. With my setup, each day I was expected to hit 4 reps at 85% or higher.  

Now, like Simple Jack’d and DLED, this doesn’t have to be in a single set of 4. There is no rep scheme. You just have to complete 4 total reps.  

  

*Why 4?* 

Because it limits you. 

Because it improves you. 

If you only had to do 1-2 reps, you would be tempted to go a lot heavier, more often. Even on DLED with 3 reps, I found myself exceeding the minimums extremely regularly. With 4 reps, if you go too heavy, you will struggle to finish them all.  

4 reps also seems to be a sweet spot for me, in that its not too much that my form starts to slip, and not too little, that I don’t get adequate practice. Its decently heavy, for 1-4 sets, then I move on. 

So each day, you warm up, and work your way up to a couple top sets. If the warmups are absolutely flying and feeling light, maybe you go a bit heavier. Hit a double at 90% or 95%, maybe try a new 1RM single. But remember, after you are done, you still need to finish the remaining 4 reps, and then get your volume in. So you need to choose wisely. 

---

**Fluctuations in recovery, and variations in performance**

When you undertake something like this, with an extremely high frequency, not every day is going to be a great day. You will have days where 85% feels like 95%, and you will have days where 95% feels like 75%.

**Its all a part of the process**

You need to lean into these fluctuations, and take them as they come. If you are having a down day, don't be afraid to just hit your minimums and be done. It is perfectly fine to just stack a brick in the wall and leave.

On better days, push yourself, see what you are capable of. Hit a new max, or better yet, a big Rep PR.

When the bad days come, and they will, dont let them get you down. Think about what went wrong, was it a lack of sleep? poor diet? too much stress at work? or just a one off thing.

If its an issue that can be addressed, address it. I usually find that a couple days of hitting just the minimums, while focusing on eating and sleeping enough, goes a long way toward preparing for a great day down the road. Which leads me to the next point...

---

**Planning ahead**

Due to the constant fluctuations in performance and recovery, you cannot expect every day to be great. Because of this, it can often pay to plan out your big PR attempts a few days in advance.

When I was preparing for my 465 bench, I started 5 days in advance. 

* For the first two days I hit some moderately heavy reps in the 90% range, followed by a decent amount of volume. The goal was to over-reach.
* The third day I hit a very heavy single on the slingshot. Acclimating myself to heavy loads, but dropping volume.
* The fourth and 5th day, all volume was dropped, and I just hit a couple reps in the 88-92% range to dial in my technique and stay fresh.

And this set me up for a huge PR that I had previously missed when I wasn't as prepared.

---

**Choosing Variations for volume** 

Choosing the right variations is all about deciding what you think you need most. I picked OHP and Incline, because my overhead work has always really lagged behind my flat bench, and I wanted to fix that. 

I chose close grip bench and slingshot, because my triceps are consistently the weakpoint in all my pressing. 

I chose Larsen Press because it is a low-recovery cost way to get additional benching in. it is something I can do even when I am feeling exhausted. 

Once you choose your variations, stick with them, give them a few weeks to shake out. 

  

---

**On PerFEcT FORm and TeCHNique** 

I do not believe there is a *1-size-fits-all Perfect Form*, but I also do not subscribe to the increasingly popular mindset that form doesn't matter.

  

I believe I fall into a third camp, and I want to take a moment to explain it, and why it is relevant to this post. 

  

**1)** I believe that a new lifter, someone who has never touched a barbell, or played competitive sports, should start out focusing on proper form, following the more textbook definitions of each movement.    

They do not have the muscle mass built up, the technique for proper bracing, or the knowledge of their own bodily mechanics, to start messing with things. They should learn to Squat/Bench/Deadlift/whatever, in a “pretty”, “clean”, manner, before they really push the intensity and volume too hard. 

**Many of the readers here in r/fitness are firmly in this category. Learn how to lift, and then move on as soon as you can.**    
  

***It is important that the new lifter does not get STUCK in phase 1 forever. They need to move to phase 2, to continue to advance***. 

  

**2)**  Once a trainee has demonstrated that they have some semblance of an understanding of the lifts, they can start experimenting with adjusting technique for their own bodies, but more importantly, just learning how to lift hard and heavy.    

**Many readers here are in this category. You know how to lift, and now its time to bust ass for a few years and just get bigger and stronger.  This is a fun place to be. Enjoy it, get big and strong, see how much you can push yourself**.    

  

***However… I believe that it is important that the intermediate lifter does not get STUCK in phase 2 forever. They need to move to phase 3, to continue to advance***. 

  

**3)** The third phase is one that is constantly overlooked. It comes when a trainee has demonstrated that they know how to put in the work. They have trained hard for years, they have progressed though the beginner stages, through the intermediate stages, they probably have some pretty impressive lifts, and would be quite competitive in local competitions.    

   This is the lifter, that needs to step out of phase 2, and learn, once again, how to *PERFECT* their technique. This is not to say they need to move toward the textbook perfect form. They need to PERFECT the form for **THEIR OWN** bodies. 

  

These technique improvements are how we transition our good lifts, into GREAT lifts. 

  

**And that’s the purpose of high frequency.**

  

Programs like this, or Simple Jack’d, or DLED with the daily focus lifts, work by allowing the trainee to dial in their technique through repeated practice. 

  

* You don’t become a better pianist by playing the piano once per week. 

* You don’t become a better linguist by studying Spanish for 30 minutes here and there. 

* I didn’t bring my bench from 405 to 465 in 50 days by just packing muscle onto my pecs and triceps. It just doesn’t work that quickly. 

  

I did it by ***GETTING BETTER*** at bench. It’s a skill, and you need to practice it. 

  

  

So if you are still in the early phase of learning how to do your lifts, or moving into the second stage of just crushing volume and intensity and building consistency, that’s fine, this post is something you can read, hopefully enjoy, and maybe some day come back to in the future. 

But if you are a more advanced lifter, and you’ve been hammering yourself with barbell lifts for years, and they still look like dogshit. It might be time to fix that.  

I’ll join you with my dogshit squat, which is the next lift on my table to be fixed up."

I'm specifically wondering if you think tonal can be used to build muscle since it's method of resistance is different from free weights and more similar to cables or resistance bands. 

The features seem pretty cool, specifically the chains and eccentric mode which apply add and reduce weight as during concentric and eccentric phases of the reps which I felt were better than free weights.

Personally, I doubt that it's worth the money since there are cheaper home gym alternatives but if tonal were to get cheaper in the next few years, do you think the level of convenience it provides may be worth the money?"

[Our last series of campfires](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9vmln4/announcing_rfitness_community_campfires/) produced an invaluable [repository of information](https://thefitness.wiki/resources/community-campfires/) that is still used by new and old members facing the same challenges. For this series we'll ask some new questions and revisit old ones, all with the hope that they help someone stay the course or make progress toward their fitness goals.  (See the most recent one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/r4skys/community_campfire_fitness_gift_ideas/).)

We'll continue by revisiting [a previous campfire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/a70bp4/community_campfire_keeping_on_track_during_the/) given that gatherings and celebrations have changed a bit in the years since.

# This Week's Topic: Keeping On Track During the Holidays

 This topic will be for those who have been able to keep their pursuit of dietary and exercise goals on track when faced with some of the conflicts of the holidays - disruption of your routine, prying relatives, an abundance of food and alcohol, scheduling conflicts, and so on. What actions have you taken that have worked?  What mindset shifts have helped? 

​

**Here are the rules for Community Campfires:**

* Top level comments must share the details of something that worked for you to overcome the challenge / solve the problem of the topic and have some effort put into them. Comments that are asking for advice or only talking about what *didn't* work will be removed. Comments that are off topic will be removed.
* Replies to top level comments should be a question for the commentor about the experience that they shared. Comments that are simply thanking them, starting an argument, or asking for personalized advice will be removed. Express thanks and dislike with votes, not comments.
* Comments should be predominantly serious. Comments that consist solely or primarily of a joke will be removed.
* Comments should be civil and follow the [Principle of Charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity).
* Any attempt at advertising or self promotion of any kind will result in a permanent ban.

Disordered,"I've got some questions regarding training for a police elite unit.  Hello.

I am a police officer and want to join our **police** elite tactical unit, EKO Cobra. Theses guys are REALLY good.

**First of all, I don't want tips for passing the test. I already can accomplish the required physical limits.**

**This topic is about a** **police special unit. So no endless marches and sleeping in cold mud for days. Nevertheless it's really tough and I want to prepare myself optimal for the tasks.**

**Obviously, I'd be happy if you aren't a member of a special unit but have good knowledge too and answer ;-)**

**1. FYI Wiki**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EKO\_Cobra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EKO_Cobra)

**2. FYI Video**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b\_0T4EdbRl8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_0T4EdbRl8)

**3. Training contents**

""marksmanship, tactical training, sports, driver courses, abseiling/rappelling, hand-to-hand combat, language classes, etc. Besides the courses taught in the basic training, further specialization is possible in fields, such as parachuting, diving, explosives, or sniping""

**4.** **Tasks**

Anti-terror, personal security for politicians and diplomats, hostage-situation, risky arrests of dangerous criminals, ...

**5. My stats**  
I'm a 6'0 ft (185 cm) tall guy and weigh between 187 and 210 lbs (85 kg - 95 kg), depending on my current focus in training. I trained for strength for a few years and then I just climbed a lot.

Started training with weights two months ago. Doing 2x upper and 2x lower body per week, with focus on basic movements (bench, squat, row, deadlift, press, pull-up, lunge). Especially upper body strength stats are increasing well again and quick at the moment.

**My current strength stats are:**

* Pull-Ups: 13 x BW
* Bench Press: 220 lbs x 10 reps
* Military Press: 145 lbs x 10 reps
* Deadlift: 330 lbs x 10 reps
* Squats: 242 lbs x 10 reps

**Running stats:**

* 1,86 miles / 3.000 m in 12:05 min
* 6,2 miles / 10.000 m in 45:36 min

**My questions**

I am curious how you guys (if you're members of such a unit) train for being fit optimal on duty. You have to be good at just everything. Muscle endurance, strength, anaerobic cardio, aerobic cardio, ....

* How often do you guys hit the weights in the gym?
* Which routine do you train?
* How do your stats look like?
* How often do you do cardio? After leg day it's hard for me to absolve a hard running workout.
* In what unit do you serve?

Thanks in advance."

Disordered,"How effective is walking?  I have never seen anybody except for obese people talk about walking as exercise on Reddit. I am curious for myself because I am obese (6'2 and 256) and I'm trying to walk an awful lot because I love it, but I don't do much else exercise.

I'm sure other forms of exercise are better for you (running would benefit you in cardio better, and lifting would benefit you in muscle tone better). But surely walking is much better than sitting on the couch.

What physical benefits does walking give you, and what distances are required to achieve any noticeable benefits?

And what are the differences, in terms of physical benefits, between different kinds of walking (pavement vs. rough, flat terrain vs. hiking up a mountain)?

Disordered,"The Problem with 'Form': Exploring 'Forms' Place and Use in Lifting.  **Preface**: 

This post is going to present a series of ideas on how to approach ‘form’ as a concept in lifting and it’s application. These ideas represent the thoughts and opinions on the subject that I have built over almost a decade of lifting [heavy things](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CWN6v-0gSv-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) with [form](https://youtu.be/8E-iMybhQUo) that has been called [questionable](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CWvYzWQgGzL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), going so far as to even win a [World Championship]( https://www.instagram.com/reel/CW_MAuRJ0YT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) in lifting unusually and in an excessive manner. That said almost everything I am going to talk about here is theoretical/conceptual, and it is what *I* think. I am not presenting facts, nor am I suggesting that anything here should become a fact. The goal is to present a viewpoint that is outside of the common understanding of form, with the hopes that you, the reader, will refine your own views on the topic. If you are convinced and agree with everything I say great, if you agree with some and move your views to something in between cool, if you think about what I am saying here and reject all of it that is okay too. The only thing I want here is to make you think more deeply about something that most people just write off as a simple and obvious topic. 

 I know that many people feel strongly about the importance of form when lifting, so I ask you to please read what I am writing and give the ideas presented a fair shake before running to the comment section to tell me how wrong I am. I intend to write this in a manner that it can be understood and processed by anyone, I will not be including complex anatomical jargon or links to dense studies that most people are not equipped to work with, and I will do my best to explain every term I am using and explain any relevant background information. That said if I am unclear in anything please feel free to ask for clarification. 

Like I did in my last post, I am going to give a short breakdown of what I will be writing about then I will get into it. 

**What Form is, and how it differs from Technique**: The first section will define ‘Form’, its counterpart ‘Technique’, and explain the differences. This is an important distinction to make both in terms of the rest of the post, and in thinking about ‘Form’ in general. 

**Why there is no such thing as ‘Perfect Form’**: The second section will look at why there is no such thing as a universal form/technique, and why individual variables, training purpose, and other factors can all influence the form/technique used. 

**Form and Injury**: The third section will cover the relationship between form and injury risk, and present an argument for thinking about injury risk as a function of load, not form. 

**Practical DOs and DON’Ts**: The final section will tie the previous ideas together into some applicable DO’s and DON’Ts.

With that out of the way lets get into the meat of the post.
___________________________________________________________________________
**What is Form, and what is Technique?**: 

The very first thing we need to do to discuss form is define what it is and is not. Form, by formal, general definition, is ‘the *visible* shape or configuration of something’. This definition applies to form in the context of lifting as well. Form is the *visible appearance of a lift, as seen by an outside observer*. This seems obvious, but this definition is important when separating form from technique. 

Technique, conversely, encompasses everything you do, consciously or unconsciously, when executing a lift. Every action you take, whether you think about it or not, to move a weight from point A to point B is part of technique. Technique is what you should be pushing to refine and improve on. Improved technique is ultimate goal, not improved *form*. 

So how does technique differ from form? The distinction sits in the ‘visible’ part of the definition. **Form is the external, visual, manifestation of technique.** Now I am well aware that this *sounds* like a pedantic distinction without merit but I think that it is very important. You cannot see every part of technique. You cannot actually see the interplay between muscle groups or the activation of each individual fiber, you cannot see the thought processes that go into activating the these muscles, you cannot see resulting forces on the weight and every bone, muscle, and joint in the body. What you *can* see is the results of those things in the way they move the body and the weight, and that is ‘form’. With form you can only *approximate* what is going on in terms of technique. 

Form is one of the few tools available to look at someone’s technique as an outside observer, but it’s limitation’s must be understood and respected. You must understand that when reviewing form you are observing a portion of the *results* from a set of actions, and then you are extrapolating what actions must have occurred to create those results. Form can never give a perfect insight into someone’s technique. With enough viewpoints and the right experience to interpret them you can get a pretty solid understanding of the technique involved but it’s still ultimately an indirect assay and thus imperfect. 

It is even more difficult to work with form in most practical settings. Unless the lifter is wearing extremely tight clothing, or no clothing at all, visual information is going to be obscured by clothing hanging in the way. Unless you are walking in circles around the lifter, viewing multiple sets from every angle you are not getting a full 360-degree view of the lift. Online it is even worse, you are getting a single (usually questionable) angle with which to view the lift in the form of a video. Not only is there an inherent disconnect between visual form and physical technique, but you are often working with an incomplete visual. This makes the final approximation even worse. 

Before moving on I want to look at a practical example to really hammer the point in: 

Picture someone deadlifting, who has some back rounding under their loose gym shirt. You can see the ‘form’ (a back that is rounded to some degree) but what can you say about the technique? Are they a beginner who is struggling to maintain a braced position and is being bent over by the weight? Or are they more experienced, purposefully maintaining that torso position while fully braced in order to effectively start from a higher position? One form, two potential technical causes. One is ineffective and should probably be corrected if the lifter wants to move more weight, the other is fine. You can use other clues to help inform that decision: how much is the lifter pulling? Do they have a level of musculature that suggests they are experienced? Is the back static or actively rounding? With this context you can make a solid assumption about technique, but the form of ‘rounded back’ does not inherently tell you what their technique is, nor if it is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. 

__________________________________________________________________________
**The Problem with ‘Perfect Form’**:

I am going to start by outright saying that perfect form does not exist. It cannot be achieved, it should not be a goal, and you should never try to impose it on yourself or another lifter. There are multiple reasons why this is true, and I will break them down in this section. 

***Form is not a goal***: The first point ties into the something I mentioned in the last section, and that is that *technique* should be where your focus lies, not the resulting form. With some exceptions for when form dictates what a lift is, or it’s competitive standards, the way your lift looks does not matter in the slightest. Yes, a competition squat in powerlifting needs to include your hip crease dipping below your knee line, but how the rest of the lift looks Does Not Matter. Effective technique does generally result in a certain spectrum of visual forms but outliers exist and putting the effort into making a lift look a certain way is getting the technique-form relationship backwards. **You should be trying form changes to see if they improves your technique, not changing your technique to see if it makes your form look better. **. Form is one tool for communicating and implementing technical changes, but that is it, it is not something that you should change your technique for because it has inherent value. If form is not something that you are trying to directly achieve there can be no reason to try and ‘perfect’ it. One could argue that *technique* could be perfected, but I would disagree there too. 

***We are not made equal***: Human anatomy has a high degree of variance. We are not built equally so it stands to reason that we should not lift equally either. Telling a 6’5’’ lifter with long limbs to perform a squat in the exact same manner as a 5’2’’ lifter with very short limbs is ridiculous. Limb to torso proportions, femur to total leg proportion, muscle insertions and origins (where a muscle is attached to bone), joint angles, and uncountable other variables all impact the specifics of a lifters most effective squat technique. In addition to the anatomy one is born with past injuries, personal preference, equipment choice, and other non-anatomical variables will further impact the specifics of a lifter’s technique. No two people should be lifting the exact same way, so there cannot be a universal ‘perfect’ technique.  

***How you should perform a lift depends on your goals***: Because we are all different, there is no universally perfect technique for a given movement, but *even an individual does not have a singular, personal, perfect technique*. A lifter can use the same general movement pattern for multiple purposes, and what those purposes are is going to impact the technique used. A bench press performed to move the most weight possible is not going to be performed in the same way as a bench press performed focused on building up the chest, or a bench press performed to develop a certain aspect of the technical execution. Which of these is the ‘right’ technique, which is ‘perfect’? None of them are. I guess you could go further and say that each goal for each individual has its own ‘perfect technique’ but at a certain point you are really going past the concept of ‘perfect’ by providing a rationale to call anything perfect.

*We are not machines*: We are incapable of executing a lift in the exact same manner over and over again. Even if there was a ‘perfect’ we could not reliably achieve it. It would be a fruitless endeavor to chase it. Instead we should look at what is a good, or even acceptable, *range* for our lifts. Deviation from the ideal is fine, technique that is just shy of the best still works just fine. Taking this approach not only gives a much more reasonable standard for your reps, but acknowledges that you are imperfect, that you will be fatigued sometimes, that your mind will wander a bit on some sets, and that you will phone it in sometimes. All of that is completely fine provided you stay within the acceptable range for technical execution, and program with that range in mind. Perfect is the enemy of good enough, so choose good enough. Time spent working hard with technique that is good enough will build more strength, size and experience than spending that same time trying to calculate or reach your notion of perfection.
_________________________________________________________________________________
**Form and Injury**: 

I’m going to start this section with another bold statement: no technique, or form, is inherently more dangerous or more liable to injure you than any other. I know this flies in the face of a lot of common opinion on the topic I request that you stick with me for a second. Injury in lifting can, outside of freak accidents or other odd cases, generally be attributed to improper load management, not improper ‘form’.

 Load refers to how much you are lifting, for any given rep or over time. Load management is the process of choosing appropriate weights for your sets, both long and short term. Any movement, with any technique, has a threshold for how much you can effectively lift with it, and exceeding that threshold results in an increased risk of injury. This failure to manage load can be acute, loading up more than you can effectively move for a single rep, or chronic, performing too many reps at a given load over a period of time without allowing time for sufficient recovery. These two are not completely independent, you can be pushing your long term load management a bit too far and open yourself up to an acute event that would not have been as issue if you had been more rested for example. The threshold is also not static, as mentioned above you have a ‘range’ of technique and you have a corresponding range of load thresholds, depending on how on the ball you are for any given rep/set. 

Now how does this tie into technique and form? Technique, and the resulting form, that is generally considered to be ‘dangerous’ is just less effective, and thus has a lower load threshold. Lets go back to the example of a deadlift with back rounding, in this case born of an inability to properly brace the torso and not a conscious decision to get better positioning. This is something that is generally considered dangerous, with the implication that lifting like this will injure you. That’s false. It’s not an inherently dangerous movement pattern, its just ineffective and you cannot lift very much with it before you cross the load management threshold to increase injury risk. If you don’t believe that lets do a quick mental exercise. Could you safely deadlift a pool noodle with an unbraced back? How about a 1 inch steel pipe? An unloaded barbell? 135lbs? You had to have answered yes to at least the pool noodle question, and probably some of the others. You already accept that you can safely pick up a trivial weight with this ‘dangerous’ form, so you accept that the variable responsible for injury is the weight used, not the technique. Obviously you should try to use the more effective technique, so you can safely lift more weight, but you are not going to have an excessive risk of hurting yourself using *any* technique, provided you lift within your ability for that movement. 

Now why does this matter? Isn’t it just pedantry? No. Understanding the actual cause of injury in this situation teaches several important lessons that can and should impact your training decisions:

**You need to manage your load**: Even with the best technique you can muster you are still at risk of injury if you lift too much. Good technique and form will not protect you against injury if you are pushing excessive loads and volume. This is usually obvious from the acute standpoint, it is pretty intuitive that trying to lift a lot more than you are capable of is going to chance an injury. The problem of chronic load management is less obvious. You can lift sub-maximally, with solid technique, and still open yourself to injury if you are trying to hit too many hard sets a session/week/month/other time period. Your body gets fatigued with every rep and that lowers its performance. You can’t hit your 1RM over and over again, and you probably can’t go balls to the wall on your sets in some movement 3x a week for months on end. Good programs will manage this but a lot of lifters, even experienced individuals, will push themselves too hard. It’s very tempting to keep up momentum when you are setting back to back PRs for example, but that is not a sustainable trajectory, even with your best ‘form’.

**You are probably not going injure yourself just because your technique is lacking**: The second important thing to realize from this injury model is that *any* movement can be performed with reasonable expectation of safety if you manage your load properly. I see a lot of beginners that are paralyzed by a fear of progression with sub-optimal ‘form’. They believe that they will sustain a severe injury out of nowhere at some point if they do not correct how they lift. While freak incidents can occur, this is not a reasonable fear. Even if your technique is sub-par, if you gradually add weight in a responsible manner you can keep progressing even terrible and inefficient form safely. I believe that this is a good thing in most scenarios. You are going to be more likely to adapt your technique and discover more efficient movement patterns if you are pushing yourself. Your body does not ‘want’ to move the weight in an inefficient manner, if you keep making it lift weights it will slowly find a better way to do it. You will change some little thing on each set and eventually something will click and you will find the weight moving better. If you refuse to keep slowly progressing weight out of fear of your imperfect technique you will not experience this stimulus to adapt. 


**Most serious injuries do not come without warning signs**: Of the two kinds of load management error, chronic and acute, chronic is going to be much more prevalent if you are lifting even remotely responsibly. When you have a chronic load management issue you are not going to be feeling great then suddenly develop an injury. It is a gradual process that almost always comes with some warning signs. If you are lifting too much with your bent back deadlifts, to go back to the last example, you are unlikely to suddenly develop a major lower back injury, you will experience discomfort, additional strain while lifting, or some other precursor before the injury occurs. You can use these warning signs to take proper steps to manage the issue. Accepting that you have these warning signs should open up what you are willing to try. If you are unsure about a technical change, or if something needs to be changed, you can keep working with it if nothing feels off. 

That said, you cannot always see a large injury coming, there is some inherent risk in pushing yourself with any technique. You can’t always see mild or moderate injuries/pain coming, as they can be the warning sign that something bigger might be on the way. You also may not be able to directly assess what is causing your pain in every scenario, sometimes the cause is unclear or unintuitive. You should not be paralyzed by the fear or injury or let it hold you back, but be cognizant it can happen, and that it probably will if you push yourself hard for long enough. You need to strike a middle ground between excessive fear of injury and complete disregard. Despite this, lifting is still one of the safest form of physical exercise in terms of incidence of injury/time spent, so keep that in mind. 

**You can train anything**: Outside of accusations that certain ‘form’ is dangerous on common movement I see a lot of people fully writing off all kinds of movement patterns as inherently dangerous, such as behind the neck presses or pulls. They are not. You can train *anything* with a reasonable expectation of safety provided you start at an appropriate weight and build your way up at an acceptable rate. You might discover at a low weight that a movement does not agree with you, or you might not hit a wall and find that you can build up to heavy weights in these atypical movements. Either way it’s *safe* to explore these movements if you do it properly, because *the technique and form are not inherently dangerous*. Just remember that you have little idea of your threshold with a new movement or technique, so start with conservative loads. 

**If it works, it works**: The final point I want to make is particularly aimed at newer lifters that are watching advanced lifters with unusual execution. I see a lot of people with no appreciable experience telling people lifting very serious weights that they are doing it wrong and are going to injure themselves. This is extremely misguided, and arrogant in my opinion. If someone has cultivated their personal technique to the point where they can lift such an impressive amount of weight do you not think that they have worked out a technique that is compatible with their body? Do you think they accidently managed to lift a weight that less than 1% of lifters could manage by doing everything incorrectly? No, if it works for them it works for them. Their load threshold with that odd technique is high enough to manage the weight, and probably higher than their threshold for a more conventional technique. It probably won’t work well for most people, but it works fine for them. They are not going to hurt *themselves* just because you would hurt *yourself* using a comparable technique. You are different people, with different bodies. To expand this idea, if you find yourself effectively and comfortably moving weight with a technique that is unusual, and ineffective for most other people, don’t try to change it just because it is not normal. It’s working for you, keep exploring it until it does not work for you then change whatever is not working at that point. Don’t try to fix something that is already working.  
____________________________________________________________________________
**Putting it all Together, Do’s and Don’ts**: 

This last section is going to bring all the ideas covered in the previous sections into some actionable Do’s and Don’ts when it comes to using ‘form’ to influence your training decisions and the advice you give to others. 

***DO use form as a source of potential changes for your technique***: I want to start this section by stating that form *does* have a place in making technical changes to your lift. It is very hard, if not impossible, to describe how you should change your lifting technique without framing it as form change. ‘Bring your stance closer’, ‘Try to start with your hips higher’, ‘Break at the hips before the knees’, ‘Touch lower on your chest’ are all examples of form advice that can produce beneficial change in a lifters technique. The SUPER IMPORTANT CAVEAT to this advice is that it is not absolute, everyone is going to lift a little, or a lot, differently. 
Not all lifters will use the most common stances for their lifts, not all lifters should be touching a bench press down at the same spot. It is definetely worth it for newer lifters and those experiencing a plateau in progress to explore this kind of advice, provided it’s coming from an experienced source. But if it does not improve your lift after you have given yourself time to adapt to it you should ditch it. There are no universal truths when it comes to form, and advice is only good and ‘correct’ if it is helpful. 

***DON’T cram yourself into a box and chase an idealized ‘form’***: I’ve said it already, but I really want to stress that form is a *means to an end*, not a goal in of itself. The point of trying to produce a specific form is to cultivate better *technique*. Chasing a specific form, and changing your technique to reach that, is backwards and counterproductive. If a change makes a lift look nicer, but you lift less effectively, or with more discomfort, then it is a bad change. If you find yourself comfortably (or at least a comfortably as heavy lifting gets) lifting more weight with a technique that produces an unusual form then go with it. Looking pretty while lifting is not the goal, at least it is not the goal of strong people. 

***DO frame your form advice as a suggestion, and know when not to give it***: Form policing is a cancer in the lifting community, it really is. It just keeps spreading and it strangles out the healthy, strong viewpoints on technique. You cannot know everything about a person’s lift just from watching a video of it, or from watching it in person for that matter. For that reason you really should structure your advice as *suggestions*, not absolute rules. The goal is to get the trainee to try something differently in the hopes that they discover a technical change that helps them. It’s a tool for guidance. When you tell a new lifter that they MUST lift in a specific way you stifle that discovery and inhibit their ability to find the technique that works best for them. 
Form policing also presents as people giving unsolicited and ineffective advice to experienced lifters. Everyone has room to improve, and almost every experienced lifter realizes this and strives for it. But someone watching a video of their lift and parroting generic beginner form advice is not helping them. It’s not helping anyone. It’s arrogant and condescending.
I have tried to write this entire post in a non-combative and tone, I really do want people that might not be initially accepting of these ideas to at least give them a chance and have tried to avoid putting people on the defensive for that reason. But we are nearing the end and I need to indulge a little bit on this one point and say that if you are form policing you need to shut the fuck up. 

***DON’T cling to form standards past the beginners stage***: This is a bit of an expansion on the point about chasing idealized form above. The general form advice that is given to beginners absolutely has a place. A beginner has no technique on which to build and the only way to really create that initial technique is to present a general form that they should try to imitate. This helps them stumble through their first reps and sets in a relatively safe and moderately effective manner. But these generic beginner form guidelines are *training wheels*. They are an excellent tool for initial teaching but at some point you need to remove them and learn to ride the bike. No one has ever won a Tour De France with training wheels. Don’t cling to them too hard once you have that initial technique down and certainly don’t force them onto more experienced others.

Disordered,"First post here and looking to get some answers by experienced lifters.  I’m 21, male. My height is 6’1ish and weight goes between 184lb to 190lb( mostly stays at 186). I do not have the best diet, I eat some junk food sometimes and sugary stuff. My sleeping routine is messed up even tho I started sleeping early and get 7/8 hours of sleep. Done with the informations, I started lifting about less than 2 months ago,  my aim is always been strength, I don’t really care as now to be cut and lean (aesthetic), I’d rather be big and bulky with some strength. Here’s my progress in the 3 main compound exercises: my bench went from 115lb 1rm to 185 1rm as now, I set my goal to bench 225 1 rep max by the end of 2021. My squats went from 185 1x4 to 225 lb 1x5 and my deadlift went from 315 1rm to 1x5 and my 1rm is 365. So the question is how is my progress? I really want to have powerlifting numbers one day, bench 495, squat 600 and deadlift at least around 800. These are veryyyyy big numbers and professional powerlifters number and I KNOW IT WILL TAKE YEARS to even come close, but I’m fully committed to take this path in life. Do you guys think it will be possible for me? Do I have potential? Thank you"

These threads are for users who have had success in overcoming a specific kind of fitness challenge to share their experience with the community (as one might share tales around a campfire) of what worked for them, answer related questions, and start a dialogue with fellow members of the community.

[Our last series of campfires](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9vmln4/announcing_rfitness_community_campfires/) produced an invaluable [repository of information](https://thefitness.wiki/resources/community-campfires/) that is still used by new and old members facing the same challenges.  For this series we'll ask some new questions and revisit old ones, all with the hope that they help someone stay the course or make progress toward their fitness goals.

We'll start back up with a light one to keep this casual.

# This Week's Topic: Shopping and Wishing for Fitness Gifts

This topic is for anyone struggling to build their own wishlist, for those with a fit friend who seems to have everything, or those with a gym gift exchange that has them stumped.  What equipment, gadget, clothing, or accessory can you highly recommend?  What have you gifted in the past that was well received?  What would make a great gift for someone with your particular sport or hobby?

&#x200B;

**Here are the rules for Community Campfires:**

* Top level comments must share the details of something that worked for you to overcome the challenge / solve the problem of the topic and have some effort put into them. Comments that are asking for advice or only talking about what *didn't* work will be removed. Comments that are off topic will be removed.
* Replies to top level comments should be a question for the commentor about the experience that they shared. Comments that are simply thanking them, starting an argument, or asking for personalized advice will be removed. Express thanks and dislike with votes, not comments.
* Comments should be predominantly serious. Comments that consist solely or primarily of a joke will be removed.
* Comments should be civil and follow the [Principle of Charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity).
* Any attempt at advertising or self promotion of any kind will result in a permanent ban.

When participating in a Community Campfire thread, remember the theme - A group of people with the same goals sitting around a campfire sharing their experience for the benefit of everyone listening.

Disordered,"Are there any differences between low and high intensity exercise, other than a slight increased benefit to cardiovascular health?  I have had a good search of online articles and reddit forums and as far as I can tell, exerting yourself as much as possible for shorter periods of time as opposed to less exertion over a longer period of time does not differ much in terms of the benefits of the exercise, apart from some extra testosterone for men (which doesn’t apply to me) and a slight increase to the benefit to the cardiovascular system.

I ask this because many people who are interested in exercise seem to say that feeling the “burn” and really pushing yourself is really important and insinuate the benefit is far greater this way. 

Can anyone more knowledgeable shed any light on this for me?"
Neutral,"Advice for strength training with only one working hand?  I'm looking for advice, ideas or experiences about strength training with one hand. Due to an injury several years ago I had my main wrist flexor tendon sheath (FCR) released surgically 3 years ago and I'm basically left with a painful right hand that flares up badly with tight gripping or flexion under load (push ups are bad news). Prior to the injury and surgery several years ago I lifted weights regularly for many years and loved it. I felt it kept me health mentally and physically. Since the injury I've lost about 30 lbs of muscle, most of my clothes are baggy now and I just dearly miss exercising. I've accepted where I'm at with the hand and I want to move forward with this new limitation. I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to get back into strength training and am looking for any ideas at all; most/all of my old basic gym lifts are not doable anymore.

I have done some looking via Google and on this subreddit, but I haven't found anything very definitive.  Thus far I have been trying some body weight exercises (mostly one legged squats, unweighted lunges and core work), Pilates, some modified yoga/DPPY yoga (I made a roughly elbow height platform that I can rest my forearms on for downward dog etc). This has been better than nothing, but I really miss lifting weights (or body weight) and strength training. I realize I'm unlikely to put on large amount of muscle with one hand, but I'd really like to recover some of my lost muscle mass and/or get that great feeling you get after a hard workout. Has anyone done strength training one handed or know of anywhere that I might find more information? It doesn't have to be classic strength training. I'm very open to any type of exercise type or program, I just miss the feeling of being tired after a good workout. Getting stronger would be a huge bonus though.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for all of the input and motivation. Super helpful. I'm going to try some of this and get back in the gym and just experiment.

&#x200B;

**In short**: I can't use my right hand/wrist for tight gripping or pushing and I'm trying to do some type of physically tiring exercise, ideally strength training, but I'm open to anything tiring, and I was hoping for and ideas or input.

Disordered,"27/M/5'8"" 150lb to 169lb - An Update on my Powerbuilding Journey  Hi guys,

Its been a while since my last post and I thought I'd just share where I am at with lifting and give an update now that I am 6-7 years into constently training (I think my last post was at 4 years into training for reference). 

**PHOTOS:**

[Before and after photo 01](https://i.imgur.com/4TrLyBH.jpg)

[Before and after photo showing legs lol 02](https://i.imgur.com/qKAbFPh.jpeg)

**WEIGHT:**

154lb (70KG) to 169lb (76.8KG) in the photos

169lb is me probably at my leanest. Usually if I am not dieting, I sit closer to 83kg/183lb. 

Timeframe is approximately 6+ years of progressive overload and eating at a surplus with a few cuts and breaks from weight training when I was travelling/busy with university. The last two years have been a bit rougher with less time in the gym and more time dedicated to other things. Progress has definitely slowed down and training volume has decreased but still a consistent part of my life. 

**LIFT PROGRESS SUMMARY**

Please note that most of these numbers were achieved at a higher bodyweight of around 183lb (83kg) to 193lb (88kg) and does not reflect my strength when cut down.

**Deadlift (Conventional):** 135lb (60kg) to 600lb (272.5kg)

**Deadlift (Sumo):** 135lb (60kg) to 645lb (292.5kg)

**Bench:** 88lb (40kg) to 353lb (160kg)

**OHP:** 45lb (20kg) to 243lb (110kg)

**Squat:** 135lb (60kg) to 474lb (215kg)

**PROGRAM**

As previously mentioned, training volume has dramatically decreased due to time constraints and life getting in the way now that I am older. I'd like to think that I am smarter with training these days and instead push each set a lot harder than I used to and make more use of it but I definitely still waste a lot of time fluffing around or chatting with friends at the gym. I am still running a Push Pull Leg Split although most weeks I will skip the second leg day for a extra rest day. I'd like to attribute this to the fact that squats have not felt great since having my ankle run over by a car when skating however I think I am just too lazy to work on the mobility etc needed to get my squat back up lol.

**Monday - Push 01**

Example workout would be

* 4x8-12 Flat Bench
* 4x8-12 Incline Dumbbell Bench
* 4x12-20 lateral raises
* 4x12-20 rear delt flies
* Tricep accessories vary

**Tuesday - Pull 01**

Example workout would be

* 10x10 body weight pull ups focusing on lats
* 4x8-12 single arm dumbbell rows
* 4x8-12 Lat pull down
* 4x8-12 chest supported row
* Bicep accessories vary

**Wednesday - Leg 01**

Example workout would be

* 4x5-8 squats
* 4x20 Walking Lunges
* 4x12 Leg Hamstring Curl
* 4x12 Leg Extension
* 4x12 Sissy Squats
* 4x12 Straight Leg/Romanian Deadlifts

**Thursday - Rest**

**Friday - Push 02**

Example workout would be

* 4x5-7 Overhead Press
* 4x12 Incline Barbell Press
* 4x12 Arnold/Shoulder press
* 4x12-20 Lateral Raises
* 4x12 Cable Flies Low to High and High to Low

**Saturday - Pull 02**

Example workout would be

* 4x4-8 Conventional Deadlifts
* 5x10 Pull ups (weighted)
* 4x8 Rowing movement
* 4x8 Lat pulldown
* Bicep accesories if there is time

**Sunday - Rest**

I still religiously do core every second day which consists of decline sit ups, dragon flags, hanging leg raises/windshield wipers.

As I mentioned, the last two years of training have not been ideal. Strength has not been a driving factor for training and I definitely could have made bigger improvements if I focused more. Unfortunately such is life and hobbies/passions cannot always be prioritized.

**COMEPETITION PREP**

Around July 2021, I decided that I needed some more motivation and that I was sick of going to the gym to just do the movements and make little to no progress. I approached my friend who competes in bodybuilding and decided that I would try my luck at a natural men's physique bodybuilding show set for mid November. 

Unfortunately one month into my competition prep my city went into Covid Lockdown and all gyms shut down (and are currently still closed). I was fortunate enough to act quickly and get a bunch of gym equipment to set up a home gym so my prep continued. However with covid spreading throughout the country, the shows looked less and less certain and the show I was intending to do has been postponed twice already. 

I decided that I would call off the competition prep three weeks ago as we are still in a lockdown and competition prep has been intruding on everyday life, work, and my relationship with my partner. 

See below photos for start of competition prep vs where I ended prep.

[Competition Prep Photos](https://i.imgur.com/clsIOMS.jpg)

**DIET**

Diet on competition prep vs everyday diet is very very different however I will list below what a typical day looked like on prep as it is a lot more structured. 

**Breakfast**

A mixture of Egg whites, Whole eggs, Protein Pancakes, Cereal, Milk, Toast, Peanut Butter, Protein Oats, and Fruit

**Lunch**

200g cooked chicken breast

200g Sweet Potato

150g steamed brocolli and beans

**Pre-Gym**

60-80g protein oats or something carby

**Dinner - Post Gym**

200g Rump Steak

400g Low Carb Potato

100g Steamed vege

Protein Shake

**Post Dinner**

200g Chicken breast

200g salad mix with balsamic vinegar dressing or something

Usually this adds up to about 2400-2600 calories depending on the day. 

When I wasn't on competition prep, things were a lot more flexible and I eat out a lot with my partner. I still meal prep weekly and make sure I eat about 60-70% of all my calories quite similar to the above competition prep diet. I generally eat between 3500-4000 calories to maintain a bodyweight of about 86kg/190lb. 

**END**

Thank you all for reading through all that lol and I also just want to thank this community for being so helpful when I first started lifting. I hope this post can help someone out there who is just starting/already into their journey. Feel free to send me a message or comment below with any questions and I will try my best to answer!

Disordered,"Boostcamp for GZCLP: An Apple and Android App.  Hi Everybody!

Today I want to showcase a physical training app that is available for both [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boostcamp-training-programs/id1529354455) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bpmhealth.boostcamp&hl=en_US&gl=US).

[Boostcamp.](https://www.boostcamp.app/)

First, I’ll tell you why this app has impressed me. They’re one of two developers to have contacted me and asked me about my programs before releasing them on their app. Because I have published many free training programs, there are many free options out there for apps that include them. However, not all are created equally – which is why I am impressed with Boostcamp.

In chatting with the development team, I have helped them add a GZCLP progression to Boostcamp, which has notable lifters like Greg Nuckols and Jonnie Candito on the team.

Boostcamp has many programs available, including: nSuns 5/3/1, Nuckols’ Beginner Program, PHUL, Reddit PPL, and Candito’s 6 Week, and quite a few others.

I am stoked that GZCLP has been added to their app. Even more so that the app does a good job of adding flexibility and many options to personalized GZCLP to suit your needs.

This means that when you run GZCLP on Boostcamp you will be able to:

Determine your training days by days of the week. This is also displayed in a neat calendar view that shows what days you trained on, providing easy review of your own training history. (Currently 4-days per week is supported in the beta, a 3-day schedule is in the works.)

Units and weight rounding. Supports both Freedom Units and Kilograms and allows for rounding to the smallest weight plate available. So if you have access to 1.25 lbs. micro plates, then go for it.

Update weights and reps. Meaning if you’ve made a bigger increase in weight than called for, perhaps because last week you noticed it was too easy, you can make that change on the fly.

Same goes for your reps. Last set rep outs (+ sets) are accounted for. This is a major function of how GZCLP progresses, so to have this be straightforward and easily tracked is huge.

Additional exercises can be added. Say you want to do more pressing on Day 2, you can add that – or another variety – using a convenient drop-down list. This is for your T2 and T3 exercises.

After completing a week of workouts, the app populates the next week for you.

After a workout you can provide a rating and feedback, noting what went right, wrong, or otherwise.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Boostcamp also provides community support! There’s a chatroom for the individual program where you can help others also running the program and get help from those same people.

Additionally, should you want to support the program creator, such as yours truly (or perhaps Greg Nuckols, or Jonnie Candito), you can! I am thankful for every donation I get from you all via PayPal, which is linked in my blog, but that Boostcamp provides this option for those content creators is greatly appreciated. In my opinion, it is important simply for recognizing the work of those that created the training programs, who without the app would not be as good!

Please check out Boostcamp, especially if you’re running a 4-day version of GZCLP. I am sure it will help you streamline your progress and make easier the tracking of your training history.

Have a fantastic day,

Neutral,"Good ways to calm down after exercising? Lately I've been feeling stressed after.  I've seen a few posts about this but not too many answers. I'm a generally happy, calm person, not depressed but a bit prone to anxiety. I've noticed that over the last few years, exercise has gradually made me feel more anxious afterwards. Especially cardio (running or dance) or anything strenuous (like heavy weights), but even with more easy going workouts (yoga or a hike), I'll feel it. It seems to trigger an adrenaline or cortisol response, which lasts for a whiiiile. It makes sense to me, I think my body just assumes we're running from a tiger and it triggers a fight, flight or freeze response. My body feels stressed out after, for at least a few hours, if not the rest of the day, and I feel like my brain goes a bit fuzzy.

I feel fantastic when I'm exercising, just not so hot after, and it's really putting me off exercising at all. If I don't exercise, I feel happy and calm throughout the day. I try to make sure I'm eating a good diet, whole foods and enough calories. I don't eat sugar really, or take any stimulants. It doesn't seem to be common, but I see a few people on here share the same problem.

Things I've tried:  
Cooling down slowly  
Trying to not raise my heart rate too high  
Breathing exercises to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system afterwards

If anyone has had this problem and found a solution, I'd love to hear it. Or ideas from anyone else! If you've made it this far, thanks!!

Tl;dr: Looking for ways to soothe my nervous system after exercising but to feeling stressed after."

Now that I hopefully have earned a bit of your attention here is a rough breakdown of what you are getting into:

**Definitions and Concepts**: It’s not exciting but I want to start off by introducing my specific definitions for some terminology, as well as some overarching ideas that form the framework of what I am presenting. I hope that by covering this from the outset the whole post will make more sense and we can avoid silly arguments based on semantic differences and misunderstandings 

**Why you should pursue Strength Goals while Cutting**: This section will go into why I think that you should entertain the notion that cutting does not need to be a period of stagnation, and why you should be pushing for strength goals during this period rather than in periods of weight gain/bulking. 

**How to Structure Training under this Philosophy**: This section will cover some ideas on how to apply the ideas presented in the former section when building your long term training regimens. 

**A Detailed Look at my recent Cut**: Finally I will go into details on what I did on my most recent cut to give an example of the suggestions discussed in the previous section in action. 

Finally I want to add a note here before we start on who is an appropriate audience for this post. This information is ultimately aimed at more advanced lifters. This does not mean that I think the information contained is worthless for beginners or intermediates, but realize that some conditions and assumptions will not apply fully or at all to you. I encourage you to think about the ideas I present, either to pull select parts for your own use or just as something to stick in the back of your mind for when you are lifting at a higher level. This post is also aimed at general lifters who want the best of all worlds when it comes to strength, size, etc. If you are competing in a specific sport and what to dive fully into the aspects you compete in this might not fully apply to you. With that aside let’s start.
_____________________________________________________________________

**DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS**:

The first thing we need to get out of the way is what a cut is and what a bulk is in this context, and what the goals of each are.

 I am assuming here that a cut is a period of caloric deficit in which you are trying to maintain muscle mass while losing fat to a reasonable level. You are not trying to gain mass in any way while cutting, and you are not cutting to obscenely low body fat percentage. I won’t put a firm number on obscenely low but if you are trying to prep for bodybuilding competition or reach a similar level of leanness that is not a cut *in the context of this post*. 

I am assuming here that a bulk is a period of caloric surplus in which you are trying to build muscle mass. The amount of fat you do or do not gain is not really relevant, but I would expect you are gaining *some*. I want to reiterate that this is the only inherent goal of a bulk here, gaining mass, particularly muscle. No other goals that might be associated with bulks are relevant here. 


Next I want to distinguish the big difference between *gaining/building strength* and *demonstrating/showing strength*. In the simplest terms, building strength refers to developing your strength potential, and showing strength refers to demonstrating your strength potential. It is really easy to blend these together as they share the same name and are interconnected but I will try hard to distinguish them when writing this. 

When I refer to gaining strength, or strength potential, I am referring generally to the force production potential of your muscles and any other long term adaptations relevant to the lifts you care about. I encourage you to think of this as a static value, 100% of which would represent the most you could lift under ideal circumstances. 


When I refer to demonstrating strength I am referring generally to what you can actually lift on any given rep, once all the factors the influence that rep have been accounted for. Think of this as a percentile system based on your strength potential. On any given day you might be able to ‘show’ 84% of your potential. In this case if your potential was a 100lb lift you would be able to manage an 84lb lift *for that one specific rep*. 

Another important term along these lines is Strength Specificity, this is simply how well you can apply your muscles force production potential to perform a specific movement. Things like technical improvement, mental focus, etc improve your strength specificity in a given movement.  

_____________________________________________________________________

**WHY YOU SHOULD PERSUE STRENGTH GOALS WHILE CUTTING**

Now that the boring part is out of the way, let’s get into the meat of this post. The idea that I am presenting is that you should structure your training with the goal of reaching new strength related PRs while cutting, and not while bulking. To illustrate why I think training should be done this way I will present a few arguments/points. 

First off let’s look at what you need from your training during cuts and bulks to successfully reach the goal of the period, maintaining muscle mass and building muscle mass respectively: 

**The volume/overall stimulation needed to maintain muscle is much lower then it is to build new muscle.** This is a lesson I think a lot of new lifters, and some not so new lifters, need to learn and really internalize. Many people seem to have the notion that you need to fight *harder* to keep muscle when cutting than you do to gain muscle when bulking. This just is not accurate. To draw from personal experience I used to train similarly when cutting and bulking in terms of volume. This made cutting harder, and rather unpleasant. Then I ended up cutting through quarantine in the beginnings of my home gym, with only the basics (rack, power bar, bench, lightish DBs and pullup bar). The lack of options ended up with my cutting a good deal of the extra accessory work I would usually do when cutting, because frankly I did not like doing most of the movements I had access to. Well after 3 or so months I looked the best I had. No noticeable muscle loss despite chopping off a good deal of my volume from previous cuts.

**The fatigue levels you need when bulking are higher than what you need when cutting**. This is very closely tied to the previous point but the general idea is that you need to be maintaining a constant state of mild fatigue in order to grow. Continuing to push yourself despite incomplete recovery is what prompts the body to adapt, so that it can perform those actions without fatigue accumulation later. Now I want to be clear that I am suggesting you need a constant *mild* level of fatigue. You can absolutely over-do it and accumulate *too much* fatigue, this is not the goal and is also counterproductive. When cutting, you are not trying to promote adaptation of your muscles, so you do not need this steady level of fatigue. 

**The exercise selection needed when bulking is probably more expansive than when cutting**. Again, this ties closely into the last two ideas. In order to generate the stimulus that will create the fatigue in the muscles you want to grow you are probably going to want a wider spectrum of movements. You want to be able to keep pushing all your muscles to the proper limit, and not let weak links hold back stronger areas. This is why isolation work and variations are valuable and important to include in your bulking programming (I am purposely using the wishy washy words in this section, please don’t tell me how you really don’t need isolations in the comment section. I know, skin cats and whatever, I am speaking generally here). When cutting, you might not need as many of these isolations or variations as even when your main compounds are being limited by one muscle group you are still getting some stimulus to the stronger ones and that is probably enough. 

So now we know (or at least that I think) that bulking requires **higher volume, higher fatigue, and more varied exercise selection** and that cutting requires **lower volume, lower fatigue and less varied exercise selection**. Let’s take a look at what you need in your training to reach PR lifts (or at least to reach them more easily). 

To lift at your full potential and **display your strength** you generally want to include the following components: 

**Low Fatigue**: Fatigue, while very important in promoting hypertrophy (and strength *gain*) through adaptation, is not beneficial to demonstrating your potential. If your body is tired it is not performing at 100%. I think this is obvious, but will outright state it here both to be safe and because it’s a component of this argument. 

**Higher Frequency of the Lifts you care about**: This is another area where you could make a counter argument but generally speaking more time practicing a lift is going to improve your technique and increase your *specific strength* in that lift. This applies to all time frames. Years of constant practice will (or at least should) make you better at a lift, but a lot of practice in a short period really puts an extra honed edge on your technique for the duration (at least in my experience and the experiences of others I know).
Lower Overall Volume: this is mostly for the purpose of reducing fatigue, but I am stating it directly for the sake the argument. 


Now, if you are starting to see the picture I am trying to paint great, if not I will spell it out now. The conditions needed to achieve your body composition goals during a bulk are **directly opposed** to the conditions needed to promote PR lifts/display strength. The conditions needed to achieve your body composition goals when cutting are **permissive** to the conditions needed to promote PR lifts/display strength. To put it in other words, trying to program for PR lifts when bulking would impede your ability to develop muscles, but trying to program for PR lifts when cutting will not impede your ability to maintain it. 

It ultimately comes down to opportunity costs. Running PR programming when bulking would give you the very best results in terms of displaying strength, but would come at the cost of sacrificing muscle gain and ‘wasting’ your bulk. Running PR programming during a cut will give *slightly* (and I do mean this, I do not think you are sacrificing very much in the way of potential due to being in a caloric deficit) reduced results, but comes at no opportunity cost, as the PR programming meets the requirements for maintaining muscle mass.

**HOW TO STRUCTURE YOUR TRAINING**

Having covered the *why* of this kind of training, let’s take a general look at the *how*. 

If you want to summarize how you should be approaching training under this philosophy it should be like this: Bulking is for Building, Cutting is for Revealing. Your bulks should be structured with a focus on building muscle, building strength, and generally improving your potential. Cutting should be structured to focus on losing fat to reveal that muscle, and peaking your strength to reveal it in the form of PRs. 

**Bulking:** There are *a lot* of correct way to go about bulking. I am not going to go into too much detail about the how here. If you are a relatively advanced lifter you probably have a good idea of what kinds of programming you like and what is effective for you. If you aren’t then, like I said earlier, this post isn’t *really* for you but here are some programs to look into that I either have run and could support for this purpose or have heard enough good things about to safely suggest:

-nSuns 531LP/CAP3 

-531 Building the Monolith, BBB, or really any leader program (I think, I’m not really a scholar of 531)

-Deep Water Training (I should plug /u/MythicalStrength ‘s Mass Building program review where he ran a combination of 531/DW. Go read that if you want to know how to bulk good). 

-Average 2 Savage 2.0 or whatever it is called now. 

-John Meadows Stuff in general, more specifically Gamma Bomb. 

This is not an exhaustive list, go ask big and strong people what they ran to get big and strong. 

**Cutting:** This I will go into a bit more detail as it’s the part that is going to differ more from the norm than the bulking portion. Here you are going to want to choose or design programming that includes *lower volume* and *higher frequency* in whatever lifts you are trying to PR. I think the key here is you need to narrow in on, and pick one or two lifts that you want to try and grab PRs on. You can only have high frequency of so many things before you stop having low volume. I would suggest one or two lifts. If two, pick an upper and a lower. I would suggest really putting your focus during the cutting period on your compound lifts. You want to spread the stimulus around while conserving your energy so compounds are going to be very efficient for you. Keep your accessory work to a minimum. 

I am a big fan of two compound lifts a day, an upper and a lower, then accessories. If you choose something like this you would want to include maybe one pair of accessory movements after the main lifts, maybe 3-4 sets, that’s it. If you only want one compound a day you could have 3-4 accessory movements. But again, the goal here is to *maintain*. The extra work beyond that is mostly wasted on accessories, save it for putting more intensity into your focused main lifts. 

If you have a different method of peaking/honing strength feel free to use it obviously. I don’t have a very long list of programs that are suited for this but I could suggest looking at:

-[Simple Jack’d](https://reddit.com/r/SimpleJackd/comments/qj546t/previous_versions/), specifically the earlier versions with 1-2 focused lifts performed daily


-28 Free Program (Nuckols): using a 3 day plan for your chosen lift and one day of the others would probably get you pretty close to what you are aiming for. Make sure to customize the listed accessories a bit or you will end up with a lot of lower if you choose something like 3 Day Squat/1 Day Bench/1 Day Dead. 

**Cutting and Bulking Lengths:** 

I personally feel that this system works better with shorter, more frequent cycles, rather than the 6-9 months bulk/3 months cut before summer that is more common. I think that shorter periods are better *period* for more advanced lifters but that’s another topic. The reasoning for this is that while you can definitely grab PRs during a deficit, you are ultimately revealing strength potential you already have, not developing anything new. This means that once you peak up to that potential there really isn’t anywhere else to go. In my experience that is going to happen in the first 3-6 weeks. After that you can obviously keep cutting but you are losing out on the benefits of the system. By using shorter cuts and bulks you can have your body composition goals reached by the time you top out on your PRs and you can go right back on to building. 

If you are dead set on the longer cut and bulk periods I would suggest periodizing your cut. Pick a lift to focus on, get it up to PR, then back off on it and move on to focusing on another lift to get a PR on, repeat as needed until you are done with your cut. 

I should also mention that you should not be choosing the same lifts on back to back cut periods if you are using a shorter cycle approach. Say your bulks are 10-12 weeks. How much potential do you really think you built on a specific lift in that time period? The answer is not that much. Pick something you have not focused on in a while as it will have a bigger backlog of unrealized potential to tap into.

**How to Structure your Focused Lifts and When to PR:**

If you are trying to build up your own programming I am going to suggest what I use, and that is high frequency, up to every day, for your focused lift(s). What this is going to look like is probably 3-6 fairly easy days and 1-2 harder days per week.

 You want the easier days to be just that, easy, remember the goal is to *minimize fatigue* most of these days are just to accumulate technical practice to really fine tune your lifts. I recommend a ‘daily minimum* in terms of total reps and weight used and build up from that. I shamelessly stole this general idea from the Simple Jack’d programs. This means you might have a minimum of X reps at Y weight. You do this every session at least. If you aren’t feeling it during warm up its fine to just do this minimum and call it a day. Make it super easy and do it as X singles if you really want. Just get it done. If you *are* feeling it you can build up. Do X+5 reps at Y, or X reps at Y+20lbs, or X+3 reps at Y+15lbs, whatever. If you do build up things should still say pretty easy, if you are grinding reps you have gone too far. 

 You can plan for the harder days to be a specific day of the week or just take them when you feel like things are moving well. You can use a specific goal for the heavier days or just go in thinking “I’m going to see where I get to but I’m going to make sure it’s hard”. This system really is about self-regulation. If you suck at that maybe do something else. 

When it comes to deciding when you are going to PR you can plan it out or just go by feel. I mostly do the later. If you are moving your warmups and your first working set(s) super well and think it’s a good day to push then go for it. You could also go with using a planned ‘hard’ day as a PR day There are no wrong answers here. 

I will caution against a trap I constantly fall into and that’s rapid PR attempts. It’s easy to hit a PR that moved really well/better than expected and think you can totally do more the next day or the day after and grab another PR right away. You might, but really this is very counter-productive. PRs are very fatiguing, and every attempt, or failed attempt, is eating into your chances for another at some point in your cut. Unless you are at the end of your cut and just want to give it a shot because you are done after that either way give yourself a gap and a series of ‘easy’ days to shed fatigue and get yourself set up for another proper attempt. 

_______________________________________________________________________

**MY LAST CUT: AN EXAMPLE:**

My last cut lasted for ~5 weeks, I started in the 275lb range and ended in the 255lb range. Half of that is my regular water shift between deficit and surplus so I lost ~10lbs of actual mass. I cut on hard deficits because I do not find them very hard to maintain and they do not seem to hurt my progress. They allow me to get solid results in the short time-frames I allot for bulking. It’s also worth nothing that I am a giant (6’5”) with an enormous TDEE. I’m still consuming a lot of calories/nutrients when at a deep deficit. You might not have as much luck trying to copy the degree of this deficit if you are not large and highly active. I consume ~3500 calories when cutting and ~6000 when bulking. I have a rough overview of the specifics here:

>Here is my ~5.5-6k Bulking Diet (6'5"" ~265) 

>My 'core' diet which is all I eat while cutting is [here](https://imgur.com/a/3jhMs3z)

>That's ~3500 once you factor in sauces/condiments/all the other odds and ends I use for flavor. 

>When bulking I add the following: 

>2 servings of oats a day (300cal) 

>A snack mix consisting of Cheerios, dry fruits, and some nuts. I fill an old 2 gallon whey tub with it weekly and eat the entire thing over the course of the week. ~5.5k cal total, 790 cal a day. 

>A large jar of peanut butter a week, 6460/week, 920/day

>2 bags of popcorn chips and yogurt dip, 1700/week, 240/day. 

>Total/Day: 3500+ 300 + 790 + 920 + 240 = 5750/day plus whatever other odds and ends I might eat because I'm not restrictive about things like snacks at the office when bulking.

I actually underestimated the snack mix when I wrote that as I didnt have the bags at the time, its over 6000 total but you get the idea.

My cardio consists of a total of 6 miles walking with my dog daily and a 5000m row on my erg before dinner most nights. I do this when bulking and cutting. The 5k is not particularly high paced, I complete it with a 2:05-2:10/500m split average and watch TV while doing it. 

My training consisted of Log Press every day with a minimum of 205lb x 6. I went higher when I felt good and picked my PR attempts on the fly. I hit the higher rep PRs near the beginning of my cut and the low rep PRs at the end. I don’t have too much more to say about this it was almost entirely self-regulated and my goal for it was to improve my log press max and hit a bodyweight rep If I could, which I did do during the last week. I had a lot of success with this type of scheme for bench on my last cut, finally reaching 405lbs. I think I will keep using it for upper body lifts as long as it works. 

Two days a week I squatted low bar. These were just a few low rep sets at moderate intensity. My main goal for this lift was to get back into the habit (my last training block was entirely focused on front squats so I could hit my goal of 500lbs). I did not plan to PR on this lift but by the end things were moving so well I made the 545x3 PR when I decided to perform a single, hitting the double if it felt really good. After how well the second moved I decided to push for the 3rd and I think the 4th would have been a coin toss if I tried it. Based on that I felt pretty confident I could manage 605, which I did on the last week of the cut. I think that the fact I got two solid PRs despite no planning/specific training really speaks to how effective reducing your fatigue levels can be. 


Five days a week (the days I did not squat) I deadlifted. Deadlifts had the most structure of all my lifts. I decided to attempt a height progression training strategy in order to try and reach 585x20. I bought 12 .75” thick rubber paving tiles from a home improvement store. I stacked them up into 2 stacks of 6 (4.5”) to use as pulling blocks. Each week I pulled 5 reps of 585 from the blocks, and on the fifth day I pulled the set of 20. I then removed tiles from the stack each week, repeating the same day scheme at each height. The heights used were 6 tiles (4.5”), 5 tiles (3.75”), 3 tiles (2.25”) and no tiles (from the floor). I originally planned on a tile a week but I had a hard end time for this cut because I was flying out for a week to go to a wedding (I actually types this entire novel on the flights) and did not want to make the 585x20 from the floor attempt right before the trip in case it ended up tweaking something. I succeeded on every set and reached my goal of 585x20 from the floor in the 4th week. 

After this I stopped deadlifting. I was pushing for 600x20 all though my last bulk and never broke 15. 585x20 is roughly equivalent to 600x19 so it is still a huge jump. I actually really liked the height progression and will be using it in the future. I think it did a great job of letting me build up a lot of work at heavy weights while still keeping things in check fatigue wise. It also did wonders for building confidence in the lift. Knowing I *just* did the set of 20 last week from a slightly higher position made it very easy to hit the next one. It also taught me to grind even harder, I hit many reps that I probably would have called impossible before this block. 

My accessory work was preformed after the main work, and was very minimal. I used an Arms, Upper, Lower split for my accessory work, and had one day a week be a rest from accessory work. While I don’t think that the specific accessories are really at all relevant or helpful for me to list I will write out everything I remember because I assume someone will ask at some point. 

*Arms:* Double Single Handle Tricep Extensions/Bicep Curls, DB Incline seated curls, Dips, Cable Overhead Extensions and Rope/V bar push downs. I also did some Poundstone Curl sets and Poundstone Extension sets. 

*Upper:* Incline DB Hex press, Barbell bench press, SSB tricep/upper chest extension, Dips, Cable pulldowns, cable rows, SSB upper back row, Single arm ‘DB’ rows with a loaded kettleball handle, Trap Bar rows. 

*Legs:* Leg press, GHD curls, Calf raises

Neutral,"Are face pulls and band pull aparts really necessary if I'm doing rows and reverse flyes?  Some of the biggest names in fitness make it sound like face pulls and band pull aparts are absolutely necessary. ""Non-negotiable"" as Jeff Cavalier puts it. My question is why? The benefits of these exercises are clear. They promote muscular balance, shoulder health, and good posture by targeting the rear delts, rhomboids, and rotator cuff. Rows and reverse flyes also directly target these muscles though, so what is it that makes these exercises uniquely beneficial. I realize external rotation isn't possible with most row variations which is an important part of targeting the rotator cuff, but this is easily done with reverse flyes by using a supinated grip.

[Read up on my review of 531 BBB to get my lifting background.](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/kn7siu/bbb_not_boring_but_not_exactly_big_but_a_lot/)

**Basic summary:** Lifted a bit in high school. Started lifting more seriously when I was 30, but was still fooling around. Got serious about lifting and saw some good progress in the last couple of years.

* Age 32
* Height: 5’10”
* BW: 168
* Bench: 280
* Squat: 280
* OHP: 175
* Deadlift: 345

**Numbers at the end of BBB:**

* Age and Height unchanged
* BW: 180
* Bench: 315 x 3 / 275 x 11
* Squat: 385
* OHP: 230
* Deadlift: 475

**Numbers at the end of current 531 training: (These are as current as possible. I'm not testing because I'm peaking to a strongman competition on the 23rd of this month)**

* Age: 33
* Height unchanged (so sad)
* BW: 194

[Before and after pictures.](https://imgur.com/a/1qfkqUg) Too be honest these aren't the best pictures to represent this. I was never going for looking bigger, just being stronger. I never thought to take a proper before/after picture because of this. So, yeah this is as close as it's going to get! (And to be honest I think the front squat PR video gives you a decent idea of body size change!)

**The template I followed after 531 BBB (I call it 531 x 365, with actual credit of the title coming from** u/3pIcenTer\*\*):\*\*

531 has so many templates and I’m stubborn. So I made up my own. It’s very basic and anyone with a basic understanding of 531 programming should get the idea of it. Without going into it too much, 531 usually has 3 main sets followed by 5 supplemental sets. Not always, but that’s the pattern that most templates follow.

I wanted something that mimicked a cycle of volume, followed by a cycle of intensity, and worked up to a yearend total. (Approximately a year, a little less than that) So I present to you the 531 template that you can run for almost an entire year. Once it’s over, retest your maxes, enter a new TM (if it’s lower than the current, always use the lower number) and then repeat over and over until you die.

I call it 531 x 365. (Get it, because you can do it all year) I used a 90% TM, but if I were to repeat it I would probably use a 85%. Maybe even an 80%.

**How it works:**

Supplemental work changes every cycle, main work follows traditional 531 programming. Supplemental work is always based off of the increased TM. I chose to increase all of my TM’s by 5 pounds except for my OHP which I increased by 2.5 pounds a cycle.

**Cycle 1: Volume**

4 day split, OHP, Squat, Bench, Deads each having their own day. Preferably rest day after two days on, then 2 more days on, then 2 rest days. Works great as a Monday, Tuesday, off on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, off on the weekend schedule. Do what you have to do though.

Cycle 1 focuses on volume for the supplemental work. Do your 3 main sets and then your supplemental sets will look like this.

* 5 sets of 12 reps of 45% of your TM. Repeat this same weight for the entire cycle for your supplemental work.

**Cycle 2: Intensity**

Supplemental work done as:

* 5 sets of 6 of 75% of your TM

**Cycle 3: Volume**

* 5 sets of 11 at 50% of your TM

**Cycle 4: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 5 at 80% of your TM

**Cycle 5: Volume**

* 5 sets of 10 at 55% of your TM

**Cycle 6: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 4 at 85% of your TM

**Cycle 7: Volume**

* 5 sets of 9 at 60% of your TM

**Cycle 8: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 3 at 90% of your TM

**Cycle 9: Volume**

* 5 sets of 8 at 65% of your TM

**Cycle 10: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 2 at 95% of your TM

**Cycle 11: Volume**

* 5 sets of 7 at 70% of your TM

**Cycle 12: Test Maxes or Do TM test, adjust to the lower TM and start over from the beginning.**

By lower TM I mean the following:

You start with a TM of 200 on bench press. After 12 cycles your TM is now 260. When you test your maxes you find out that your actual max for bench is actually 260. Using the 90% TM means the new TM you would use is now 235.

In a different example, you started with a 200 pound TM on bench, but when you test your new max you actually bench 300. This would suggest that your new TM should be 270, but stick with the 260.

Stick with the lower number and you’ll have less chances of getting stuck. What do you do if you get stuck? Follow normal 531 protocol. I never stalled on this programming.

**Accessories:**

Do what 531 programming suggest or do your own thing. I did my own thing and had great success with it.

I reached my strongest point by doing the following for accessories.

1. Find a TM for your accessory just like you would a main lift. Either max out or find a top set of 3-5 where you couldn’t do more reps. Then take a 90% of that to get a TM.
2. Take your TM and take 70% of that and 50% of that.
3. Do 3 sets at 70% of your TM like this: 5, 5, 5+
4. Do 2 sets at 50% of your TM like this: 10, 10
5. Keep the same weight for the entire cycle and just try to beat your + set
6. If you could get all of the minimal reps on all 5 sets (at least 5 on the 3rd set) then increase the weight by the smallest amount possible. If it’s a machine that goes up by 2.5 pounds then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If it’s a bar that you can put 2.5’s on either side then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If it’s a machine that you can add 10 pounds to as the minimal number then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If you can’t complete the reps then either lower the weight or repeat the weight next cycle.

**My bench day accessories:**

* Row, lateral raises, close grip bench (giant superset thingy)

**OHP day:**

* Weighted dips, Chest flys/superset with reverse flys, rows

**Deadlift day:**

* Lat Pulldowns, shrugs, leg extensions superset with leg curls

**Squat day:**

* Split squats, weighted back extensions, lat pulldowns

Ab rollouts or hanging leg raises every day. If I had extra time I would do a facepull/tricep superset with the ropes or a curl/forearm curl superset.

Some kind of conditioning every workout and on most rest days.

My accessories often changed if I got bored or wanted to train for a specific event, but for the most part I would keep them the same so I could track progress. Sometimes I would do cleans with an axle bar or regular bar after a squat or deadlift workout. Sometimes I’d do incline bench press instead of close grip bench. Sometimes I would do leg press, hack squats, or smith machine squats instead of leg extensions or split squats on one of my lower body days.

**Conditioning:**

Usually done every day. I would often rest on the weekend and not do too much. Conditioning always changed based on the current needs. If I had nothing to prep for it was just sled pushes/pulls, jogging, sprinting, and bike.

If I was prepping for a comp it was usually comp specific. High volume lift representing the strongman event. Tire flips, vehicle pushing, sled pushing, power cleans, carrying stuff, etc…

**Other:**

Every other week or so I would skip my Wednesday rest day and take Friday off so I could train strongman events on Saturday.

**Diet:**

I usually ate quite a bit. Between 3,500 – 4,000 calories for the most part unless I was cutting weight. I often cut shortly after comps because I liked to drop 5-10 pounds and then bulk up into my next competition. Felt like I was stronger if I was gaining weight so I never went into a competition dropping body weight. It has worked pretty well. I’ve brought home some cool strongman trophies!

I just tried to eat around 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. I ate like every 3 hours because sometimes I would get caught up and not eat enough to go along with my training.

Supplements? Just some caffeine and creatine. Fish oil.  Mostly pizza.

**Findings:**

The first week of the new cycle was always a killer. Week 2 was much better and by week 3 the supplemental work felt like I was throwing it around. It wasn’t uncommon that I had to rest for the last set or two of the supplemental work on week 1. Maybe on OHP I would have to Push Press most of the last set. Deads turned into touch and go’s, etc…

Other than that I really liked it. I would almost get nervous/excited for a new cycle and I really liked knowing exactly what I was working towards for almost the entire year.

At first I was able to push the + sets early on. As the TM’s got heavier and heavier I was doing 5 pro’s more often. I think if I would have picked the lower TM this wouldn’t have been an issue and the next time I run this that’s the plan.

**Random notes:**

I love doing the supplemental work as a variation of the main work. The important thing is to use the appropriate TM for the different work. I don’t suggest basing it off of the TM of your main work.

For the most part I would pause my main bench sets, but do touch and go’s on the supplemental.

Trap bar the main deadlifts (if I was preparing for a car deadlift) and conventional deadlifting the supplemental.

Using front squats or SSB squats as the main work and doing the supplemental as back squats.

Using the log or axle every now and then on OHP, etc…

**What’s next?**

I’m going to challenge myself in the next weight class in strongman. I’m going to follow BBBeefcake, BTM, and deep water. The goal is to gain 20 pounds, then follow it up with 12 weeks of other programming while I cut 10 of those pounds back off. Repeat for another 20 pound gain and then another 10 pound cut. That will put me right around 225 body weight, a nice place to be when competing in the 231 weight class as I can go into comps gaining weight like I usually do. Maybe I get fluffy. Maybe I look buff. At the end of the day I don’t care too much as long as I get stronger.

Then??? Who knows."

Disordered,"How sleep affects weight loss (Research Review)  **Summary:** Poor sleep may make you gain fat and lose muscle mass. If you are on a diet, you may lose fat slower.

**Sleep deprivation slows fat loss and burns muscle instead**

>Two studies have looked at the effects of sleep restriction in an energy deficit on body composition (fat mass and fat-free mass) in adults \[[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951287/); [23](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/5/zsy027/4846324)\].  In these studies, all participants lost body weight. However, the  sleep deprived participants lost more fat-free mass (i.e muscle and  water).  
>  
>""We found that sleep restriction resulted in less loss of fat but greater loss of lean mass (...)."" - Wang et al. 2018 ([23](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/5/zsy027/4846324))

**Sleep longer for faster fat loss**

>The current evidence suggests that increasing sleep duration and quality is  beneficial for losing body fat. This might be because you are less likely to overeat, the longer you sleep \[[43](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22854682/)\].  
Three studies have found that sleeping longer is associated with reduced fat mass ([54](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32141273/), [43](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22854682/), [41](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31983513/#:~:text=No%20differences%20in%20cortisol%20or,treatment%20of%20obesity%20in%20adolescents.))

Disordered,"My six month journey from very underweight to healthy (25M; 5'7"" /130lb -> 147lb; mid March to mid September)  Alright, I'm going to try to keep this as objective as possible, so bear with me. I'll put this in the beginning just to get it out of the way: 

[Start](http://imgur.com/a/gTJtyqL) / [3 Months](http://imgur.com/a/AdqKRNv) / [6 Months](http://imgur.com/a/BP3SrIG) 

Some older background: Luckily for myself, I've always been fairly athletic and played a bunch of sports growing up, including baseball, football, and basketball. I had never really considered my weight an issue, as I felt I was fairly muscular because I played sports. 

Some newer background: Right before this, I was drinking somewhere between 3-6 beers a day. I was also only eating maybe two meals a day. Pair that with a super fast metabolism, and you get overly underweight and a lose of strength. 

One day, I decided to buckle down, cut drinking cold turkey, eat more, and change for the better. 

I had some previous gym experience freshman year of college and some from a little bit before covid, so I felt somewhat comfortable trying to get back into the swing of things. I used some of what I knew previously, as well as looking thru the fitness wiki and this subreddit, to decide on what routine I'd get myself into. Ultimately, I decided to use the program listed in this post here: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). 

I decided on a PPL split only because that's what I used to do before, it's what I felt most comfortable with, and I couldn't figure out the difference between all the other splits with the information overload. I adapted some of it to fit some of the workouts I wanted to include, and it's changed over time. Listed below are what I started with (with weights) and what I'm currently at (with weights). One disclaimer: I did end up switching gyms, so some of the weights don't translate properly. I don't understand why at different gyms or between different equipment, some weight numbers mean different things on different machines, but it is what it is.

All x2, Every Other Day 

So yeah, there's that. I usually do this six days a week, barring any outside circumstances. 

As for my diet, that's a strange thing. I'm the type of person that is perfectly content with eating the same three meals, every day, with minimal effort in making all three. People make fun of me all the time, but it is what it is. The schedule of my job doesn't really allow me to cook dinner often either. I try and eat things that are cheap, high in protein, and high in calories. If I can get all three of those things, I'm happy with eating it. With that, my daily meal and snack list is the same. Same bowl of cereal for breakfast, same turkey sandwich for lunch, same frozen pasta bowls for dinner. Listed below in the link are screenshots of all three meals and a snack, as well as the nutritional content of what I get throughout the day. I know I probably eat too much protein and maybe sodium. If anyone has suggestions, feel free to let me know. 

[Diet](http://imgur.com/a/Sg0sZc8) 

Other things to include:  
- In the past month and a half, I've started to use pre-workout. I personally use Pre-Jym.  
- In the past month or so, I've started to use creatine. 

Main things I've learned:  
- Form is most important (given).  
- Breathing control is second most important (basically, to me).  
- Eating more and better really did make a world of difference.  
- You can surprisingly go up in weight wayyyy quicker in the beginning than I thought. 

Things I'm working on:  
- Mainly incorporating deadlifts into my routine. Thinking about first exercise on my pull day before barbell rows. Would remove back raises.  
- Trying to focus on my chest. Always been the weakest part of my body. Not exactly sure how to be more dynamic and really hit it hard. 

Things holding me back:  
- From three to six months, I feel like I've had minimal visible change. I've increased in weight a decent bit in some areas. Am I plateauing? (hence use of pre-workout and creatine).  
- For the last few weeks to months, I've had progressively worse left golfer's elbow tendinitis. I've been working to reduce the root cause of it while increasing the stretching of my wrist/forearm area. I have been working thru it currently (although it's probably not recommended).  
- My right shoulder is weird. Overuse of throwing a baseball (possibly incorrectly) when I was younger has caused it. Kinda feels like it pops a lot. Kinda feels painful at times. Kinda seems like rotator cuff, but really not. I don't think it is. Who knows. 

But yeah, ultimately that's my progress, journey, and guide to where I'm at now. I'm open to suggestions on any aspect of what I've done so far, whether it be focus exercises or dietary changes, so please let me know! Thank you all very much.

Edit: Reddit is a very weird place man. I'm very jaded when it comes to this post now. I woke up this morning to a TON of people telling me I wasn't underweight and basically shitting on me. First off, my bad. I don't periodically check my BMI. I haven't done that since they make you do it in high school. Plus, what else am I exactly supposed to reference for being underweight? I don't ask other people for their weights and to see them with their shirts off. In my mind, I was underweight. For that, I guess I apologize for being wrong for something I didn't even know about. If I could edit the title, I would. I'm jaded because I've seen this sub help a lot of people, I've asked questions in it and looked for help, and I've seen people make some great progress too. I was surprised when I made a lot of progress, so I thought I'd share because I figured it could help others too. But a part of me wants to say screw it and delete the whole post altogether because people are getting mad over me not knowing I wasn't underweight. What's the point of trying to be positive when every comment is shitting on you for an uneditable title? I don't know what else to say."

Disordered,"4/3/2/1 Plate Dead/Squat/Bench/Press – The Scenic Route  **Intro:**

A lot of the posts on this subreddit are about the most efficient/effective way to reach your goals and if you have the time/energy/dedication to do that I have the utmost respect for you. This post, however, is not like that. I have just reached my personal goal of achieving a 4 plate (180 kg) deadlift, 3 plate (140 kg) squat, 2 plate (100 kg) bench press and 1 plate (60 kg) strict shoulder press, all in all this has taken me eight years (two years of messing around + six years of more dedicated lifting), hence why the title of this post is ‘the scenic route’ and I am here to tell you that story.

**Background:**
I am British (hence the use of kgs, sorry ‘mericans) and in highschool I was the classic lanky emo kid, in terms of sporting background I did dance and swimming up until the age of around 14/15 and then didn’t really do anything sporty until starting to go to the gym at around 17 years old. From around age 17 to age 19 my going to the gym was very sporadic and intentionless so I have not included it in detail here. I  properly got into fitness at around age 19. I am currently in the final year of grad school at a top UK uni (think Oxbridge) and studying a subject which is an experimental science, as such I have not been able maintain much consistency in my lifting (I’ll go into more detail below).

**Before and After:**

As I will also explain below, I am not really involved in fitness for aesthetic reasons but I know you guys will want to see pics anyway, these are the best ones I had easy access to. 

https://imgur.com/XUSuyt2

Bonus titty pic: https://imgur.com/FBJQX3k

**Stats:**

**Before:** 2015, age 19, height 6’3’’ (190 cm) weight: ?? (I’d guess 60-65 kg)

Deadlift: Untrained

Squat: Untrained

Bench: ~60 kg for a shaky double

Shoulder Press: ~20 kg for reps

**After:** 2021, age 26, height: 6’3’’ weight: 82-86 kg

4/3/2/1 baby!! 

**Motivation:**

I lift solely for my mental health, in 2015 I was diagnosed with depression and in 2020 I was also diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, I take antidepressants but lifting has changed my life. Lifting is the thing which keeps my mental health in check but also the fact that I am able to make small goals which are achievable within weeks really helps when my day-to-day life is working towards a goal which is a long way in the distance (like a PhD). Obviously it is nice to make some aesthetic improvements too but this is not my personal goal.

**Training History:**

Pre-University
As mentioned above I sporadically attended the gym (perhaps once or twice a month) from ages 17 through 19 but looking back, I made little progress in this time 

Undergraduate

When I began going to the gym as an undergraduate, I spent perhaps the first two years doing various forms of bro-split (think chest and tris, back and bis etc.). This sort of thing gets a really bad rep on this site and while it is true that bro-splits are not a very efficient way of training they do have their benefits, namely:

* Getting used to being in a gym – gyms are very scary for newcomers especially lanky emo kids, just getting used to being in that space can take time
* Getting used to being under a bar – although at this time my only real barbell exercise was the bench press, just getting used to holding something heavy in your hands is really important
* Ease and simplicity – with a Bro-split there is no pre-planning no spreadsheets, no faff, you just go to the gym and if it hits your chest and your tris and there’s no queue you go for it

The next program I ran was PHUL, at this point in my training I became aware that ‘training programmes’ existed and pretty much found the first one I could and did that. I would say that PHUL is a good programme for bodybuilding style training but probably this was not the right time in my training to do it, nonetheless I found the following benefits:

* Getting used to a programme/logging workouts
* Lots of variety so not too boring
* Definitely made gains faster than a bro-split 

There was also the following negatives:

* Lonnngggg workouts, especially when working out with a training partner

* Now, as someone interested in powerlifting I would class there as being a lot of unnecessary 
accessory movements and not enough focus on the main lifts (but that is very personal).

This brings me to around the end of my undergraduate degree so at this point I am 22 years old and my stats are around:
Deadlift: 100 kg
Squat: 80-90 kg
Bench: 80 kg
Shoulder Press: ~40kg for reps.

Grad-School

While there are some people who are able to maintain consistency while at grad-school I am not one of those people. In my first couple of years of grad-school especially it was not uncommon for me to work in the lab for a minimum of 9 am-7.30 pm every day and then also work for at least some of Saturday. Also due to the nature of experiments I had to stay until past 10 pm maybe 3 or 4 nights a month. This amount of work sucks but this post is not to complain about the life of a PhD scientist it is to talk about fitness. I am also in a long-distance relationship so about one weekend in every three I am not in my university city to train.

My ethos for my training in grad school has been, when you can train, train. This means that some weeks I am able to go 4 times in a week, some weeks I am able to only go once, some weeks I cant go at all. I have also had periods of months off for a wrist injury (not gym related), when I spent some time at a University in Asia and the dreaded COVID lockdowns (although I tried to do some home workouts with minimal equipment during these). Despite these setbacks I have been able to consistently increase in strength over the past 4 years, albeit slowly.

Programmes in Grad-School:

GZCL 

For the first couple of years of grad school I ran a GZCL style programme, I chose a 4 day split but as explained above, I was not able to be consistent with my frequency so sometimes that 4 day split happened in a week and sometimes it happened in 3 weeks.
Benefits

* My first powerlifting programme – enjoyed making consistent strength gains

* Lots of spreadsheets out there to make programming easy

* Lots of variety in rep and weight ranges so you don’t get bored

* I first hit my 100 kg bench and 180 kg deadlift during this time 

Negatives

* Sometimes you can progress faster than the programme dictates which can either lead to you being frustrated or having to mess with your spreadsheets

* Workouts can sometimes be quite long

5/3/1

I ran 5/3/1 for around a year pre-COVID and it has been by far my favourite programme. I ran a 4-day variant but as sated above this didn’t always happen in one week. 
Benefits 

* Easy programming

* Quick workouts

* Quick gains

* I first hit my 60 kg shoulder press during this programme

Negatives

* Assistance work can be boring

Making it up

Post-COVID it has been really hard to have any consistency, in the UK we have had several lockdowns and I have also had to do some personal isolation periods for close contact etc. I am also in the final year of grad-school so my busy schedule has been even busier, as such for the last year or so I have just been making it up in the gym (which I’m sure on /r/fitness will cause people to bring out the flaming torches). My routine now is just 2 days on repeat, one day in the gym I squat and bench, the next day I can go to the gym I deadlift and shoulder press. If I have a long time that day I will do a lot of accessory movements, If I don’t have a long time I will do my main lifts and get out. With regards to weight/reps I base it on how I feel that day, some days are heavier with less reps some days are lighter with more reps

Benefits

* Extremely flexible schedule 

* Requires no planning

* Easy to workout with others

* Finally reached my 140 kg squat

Negatives

* Slower progress than a real programme

* Sometime requires more ‘on the spot’ thought about what you’re gonna do.

**Cardio**

The only cardio I do is cycling to and from the lab for a total of about 30 minutes each day, I feel this is enough to keep my heart healthy while not killing my gains.

**Equipment**

You absolutely don’t need a bag full of fancy equipment to make gains the few things I use are chalk – to grip stuff, a belt to help get a better brace, wrist wraps if my wrists are playing up and lifting shoes which are not necessary but are a nice treat as they are very comfortable/sturdy/stable to squat in. 

**Diet**

As stated above I do not workout for aesthetics I work out for my mental health, as such my diet ethos has been eat as healthy as I can, and aim for just over my tdee until my belly gets to a size I’m not happy with and then eat just under my tdee until the belly goes. In practice this means I eat around 3300 calories a day when eating above and when eating below I eat around 2500 (usually achieved by skipping breakfast). I have adjusted these goal posts slightly as I have got heavier over the years. Also for the last two years I have been vegetarian not much has changed but my shits are generally better. 

**My thoughts from my own experience**

I hope from this post I have made it clear that not every fitness journey has to take the most efficient route. Could I have achieved these goals in two years with proper training and diet? Yes, probably. Would that have fit in with my life? Absolutely not. I have a busy life and I am not willing to sacrifice other parts of it such as socialising, working or sleeping, as such, I have fit in working out where possible and I have learned not to beat myself up if I can only get to the gym one time in a week. Not every person has to reach their genetic maximum as quickly as possible, if you are going to the gym and feeling good then don’t worry, you are doing good. 

**Advice for new lifters**

* Do your research, find a programme you like the sound of that you think will help you reach your goals

* Don’t get to caught up in ‘what is the absolute best thing for me’ – going to the gym 100% of the time will be better than not going 

* Don’t listen to the people who say ‘you can always fit in lifting you’re just lazy’ sometimes you cant fit in lifting or sometimes going to that party or going to bed early is more important and that's okay.

* Don’t beat yourself up – okay you’ve missed the lift, or you’ve missed a week of training or you’re not getting where you want as fast as you want, don’t worry, not everyone works in the same way, you’ll get there.

I hope that the good folk of /r/fitness have enjoyed reading about my journey and own personal takeaways and I’m happy to discuss anything I’ve said below but please be kind and civil <3

Neutral,Gym Story Saturday  Hi! Welcome to your weekly thread where you can share your gym tales!
Neutral,"Mike Mentzer's High-Intensity Training Protocol  *DISCLAIMER* I apologize in advance for my run-on sentences lmao.

Alright so before posting this I know there are going to be people that absolutely despise Mike Mentzer and his style of training, and people that completely support him and his ideas, but if possible I would appreciate if any responses to this could be kept objective for the simple fact that I am only here asking about the facts, and nothing more.

Anyways, I'm still currently in the process of reading and taking notes on his last published book ""High-Intensity Training the Mike Mentzer Way,"" and knowing that in the past about 20 years a lot more scientific research has been done, more experiments and such have been conducted, which naturally would potentially mean that some of his theories since have been indirectly or directly proven. I think that the idea of High-Intensity training is very productive in a time sense, and as it has a direct correlation with training with volume (that numerous studies have been conducted on since the book's publishing,) there has to be some kind of truth to taking weightlifting protocols of each side of the spectrum to get a specific desired end result. It makes sense that this type of training style has some if not a whole lot of legitimacy to how one could go about beginning to take one's physique to the next level, however due to his untimely passing, I nor anyone else could go to him to has him more specific questions on the how's and why's of certain principles he has in his HIT workout style. Again I do not want bias or opinion, but just facts/answers that anyone might have, or how I might find them.

So these are not coming from a place of doubt, rather genuine intent to understand why things are some of the ways he claims. Note: As I continue reading, I may continue to edit this and ask more questions that I myself cannot find the answers to.

* He frequently mentions the body's ""precious energy reserves,"" and that if too much time has been spent in the gym, the reserves would be depleted further and further as lack of proper recovery to the muscular stimulus due to over training, and/or too much time in the gym. My question is that what is that measure of ""energy reserve""? This theory makes sense on paper, however how would one 100% know the as he mentions ""precise"" threshold amount of time to which one needs to be in the gym for optimal muscle growth, and/or how would one know if that threshold has been surpassed to the point where muscular regression begins to occur? Additionally, if it begins to regress and the body will as a result need more time to recover, how would or could the amount of recovery time needed be found?
* What measurements have been taken or what studies have been done to show the not only optimal ""muscle recovery"" time, but the body's energy use recovery time from weight lifting sessions? For High-Intensity? For longer Volume workouts? 
* What effects in short term and long term would this high of intensity workouts have on the body's CNS (central nervous system)? Would adequate recovery time as he describes allow for it to completely recover as well, or would it undeniably cause it burnout?
* How much of HIS actual workouts that he himself did to attain the results he got naturally (assuming he was natural, and if you claim he is not, where can it be shown concretely that he isn't) go by the guidelines written in that book? Did he actually use that much time to recover, or were a bulk of his workouts done with slightly more volume and a bit less intensity, so that he could train a bit more than max 1-2 times a week?
* This goes hand in hand with the question above, but some have speculated that his findings and claims in that book were not representative of the actual volume of work he did to get his results, and that for a majority of the time he trained he actually worked out 3-4x a week. Hypothetically, if you were to take the workouts prescribed in the book with the same time and intensity, would it be effective to do those workouts 3-4x a week? Or are they actually so intense that you should only do one every 4-7 days like he says, because his training prior to these findings weren't quite as intense, which allowed him to workout more than once every 4-7 days?
* Would using progressive overload AND linear intensity increase in workouts and decrease in times be effective or be able to be carried out in a sort of cycle with similar or good results? 

Thank you to anyone with any kind of good or useful responses. I know it is a lot of questions I am asking, but as someone who likes to find the objective truth when it comes to implementing practices in my day to day life (especially ones I will be using that have a direct impact on my body,) I know that figuring these things out will help me be able to best piece together most effective tactics from various sources, thus allowing me to have a more effective approach to how I will be lifting, and eventually will help me be able to explore and understand even more than some that have gotten this far. I find the whole science behind bodybuilding extremely fascinating, with all the different combinations of workouts and adjustable stimuli able to be manipulated in order to achieve a specific desired effect. I know lots and LOTS of others are just as interested in this if not more than me, but if I could at all contribute to helping others and myself learn more than has already been learned, it'd be super dope. If you read this much of my spiel, hats off to you ahahahah."

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have.

Ending weight: 130 lb

Diet: This is something I still struggle with, specifically getting my micros in. For the first 6 months of working out, I was eating around 1800-2300 calories and went up to around 134lb. The next 6 months were more about focusing on my protein intake and it's averaged to around 1800. I try to make sure I'm eating something with meat or eggs in it everyday and I have at least 50g of protein in me even on a bad diet day.

I'm currently planning to cut down 8-10lb and am going with the following caloric plan: 1600 calories (173g carbs, 134g protein, 34g fat). 

I'm using myfitnesspal to track and assign my macros and diet.

Exercise: I'm following a PPL split. I used to do 3 leg days, 1 back/ bis and 1 chest/tris/shoulders when I started out, but had to forego this routine after it just led to my legs not recovering fast enough and also not seeing enough upper body progress. Upper body is still a weak point for me, specifically with bench and anything to do with triceps. My current PPL looks like the below:

Back/Biceps - 5x5 DL, 4x12 Bent Over Row, 4x12 Seated Cable Row, 3x10 Hammer Curls, 3x10 Zottman Curls, 1-3 sets of 21s

Chest/Triceps/Shoulders - 5x5 OHP, 4x8 Bench, 3x12 Tricep Cable Pulldowns, 3x12 Overhead Dumbbell Extension

Legs (Quads/Glutes) - 3x8 Squat, 3x12 Hip Thrusts, 3x10 Bulgarian Split Squat, 3x12 Leg Extension

Rest Day

Back/Biceps

Chest/Triceps/Shoulders - same routine, but 5x5 bench first and then 4x8 OHP

Legs(Hamstrings/Glutes) - 3x8 Squat, 3x12 Hip Thrusts, 3x10 Bulgarian Split Squat, 3x10 Back Hyperextension, 3x12 Seated Leg Curl

I used to mainly rely on squats to build my legs at the start, but I realized this was a bad idea back in June as it led to a lot of quad dominance and was a factor in my knee injury. Focusing on isolated leg work like BSS has really helped with my knee pain and also helped increase overall definition of my legs.

Current Lifts:

Diddly: 155lb 1RM (Starting lift - 60 lb)

Squat: 105lb for 3x8 (could go higher I think, but I injured my knee which set back progress. Don't want another repeat of that) (Starting lift - just the bar)

Neutral,"The Secret is Patience  #Link to Article - [THE SECRET IS PATIENCE](http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2021/09/the-secret-is-patience.html)

Once again, /u/mythicalstrength has his finger on the pulse and puts words to some things I've been ruminating on as well.  

The tldr should be pretty obvious: big changes in this space take time and persistence, but our modern day lifestyles and the marketing gimmicks that hack into them don't set up the uninitiated to be prepared for this stark reality.  

To add something of my own to the conversation, this lack of patience also seems to rob people of the satisfaction of the short term results they have achieved:  

""I've lost 16lb in 3 months and I'm not at my goal weight, where am I going wrong?""   

""I've been lifting for a year and despite improving my lifts greatly, my quads don't look like this professional bodybuilder's, what am I missing?""  

These people have achieved very real and very important successes, but because they have been blinded by the 'instant results' hoopla, they've denied themselves the gratification of this particular instant.  

We're all gonna make it, gang.  It's just gonna take time, but that doesn't mean we can't celebrate successes along the way, too."

Disordered,"My 5 Years of Fitness Progress: The Joys of Calisthenics and Gymnastics  Hello friends!

**General Thoughts and Summary**:

So to keep a long story short, I started lifting in middle school (around 7th grade). At the time I didn't really know much about training and I wasn't consistent so I lifted weights on and off all the way through high school (2016 picture).

Once I got to college, I had easier access to a gym and got a bigger and stronger because of that (2019 picture). I trained with weights and focuses mainly on bodybuilding.

* The convenience of my college gym was really conducive to my progress.
* Having a base fitness background isn't need for bodyweight training but is helpful.

Then around the end of my junior year in college, I met some people that showed me calisthenics so I started training it the Summer of 2019 and fell in love with it. I incorporated it into my training and exercised a lot more frequently.

As time went on I started training on Gymnastics rings, now I'm the strongest and fittest I've ever been (2021 picture). The things I'm currently training are quite high level.

Here's just some general thoughts regarding that.

* Consistency is king, I became much stronger through calisthenics because I was training more regularly vs when I was purely lifting weights.
* Really enjoying my training made it much more effortless to exercise which helped with consistency.
* Bodyweight training can expose weak links and lagging areas. I developed more mobility and body control because calisthenics movements required more of that. This also helped me reduce injuries because I had to ensure my weakest links were strong.
* Turns out I'm very good at calisthenics and rings. My body type is quite ideal for that so I've been able to achieve some very high level skills

If you're someone that's tired/bored of their current training style, then maybe exploring other forms of training, such as bodyweight exercises, might be what you're looking for. Currently I do mainly calisthenics with weight lifting supplementary exercises.

My current goal is to achieve F skills on rings (Pretty much moves you only really see in the Olympics),  wish me luck :)

&#x200B;

**Training**:

* **Lifting Experience**:

So I pretty much did bro splits from middle school to most of college. I forget the exact splits I did but it probably wasn't anything smart of well thought out. I think it was something like: Biceps + Back, Triceps + Chest, Shoulder + Something Else, and Legs

Really most of my progress at this time was noob gains and that I was lifting regularly. I didn't have any strong or impressive numbers on my lifts but I could rep out pushups and pullups. I also dabbled in weighted pullups and dips.

I think the main thing was weightlifting gave me a good strength foundation for when I eventually swapped to calisthenics. My two main problems with weightlifting were that personally for me I could've been more consistent with it and that I was always tight and stiff because I purely lifted and that's pretty much it.

Then I made the jump to calisthenics.

&#x200B;

* **General Info on Calisthenics**:

Before I get more into the calisthenics part of my training, just wanted to provide some general info.

1. There's many different things that fall under the umbrella of bodyweight training, I focused mainly on calisthenics and ring strength training.
2. Calisthenics strength training is similar to powerlifting (weighted calisthenics is basically just powerlifting but with weighted pullup, muscle up, and dips) and weight training in terms of training principle but instead of lifting weights you use your body. We use **progressions** (easier versions of exercises) to progressively overload to ultimately achieve some move usually referred to as a **skill**.
3. It's not just HIIT or high pushups and pullups!
4. Because our entire bodies are used, you'll notice weak links when you're training. This is great because in the long run it can bring up lagging body parts and lead to more balance, coordination, and mobility (can't do a handstand if you don't have shoulder mobility). Good form is very important!
5. One thing to highlight is a lot of high level strength moves require straight arms (referred to as **straight arm strength** or SAS). Because of that, we also have to account for our tendons and joints because some moves can hit them quite hard. Tendons take longer to develop than muscle so it's wise to not try to progress too fast, you can risk injuring yourself.
6. Don't want to toot my own horn but don't take my progress as being indicative of everyone that trains calisthenics. The progress I've made is quite fast and I'm currently doing moves some people have dedicated years to achieving. I'm probably around the top 1-2% of people strength skill wise training calisthenics. But definitely try, it's an awesome time!
7. Sorry if some of the exercise names/terms aren't familiar to you! The clips I have linked should show what they look like. Here's a chart that does a pretty good job of listing exercises and their level of difficulty: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19l4tVfdTJLheLMwZBYqcw1oeEBPRh8mxngqrCz2YnVg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19l4tVfdTJLheLMwZBYqcw1oeEBPRh8mxngqrCz2YnVg/edit?usp=sharing)
8. Skills difficulty rating. So the Gymnastics Code of points rates skills from A - K where A is the easiest and F is the hardest. For rings, the highest scoring moves are F. Right now I've achieved/working on C, D, E skills. For context an Iron Cross ([https://i.pinimg.com/originals/79/39/fd/7939fd84b0e836f8d773f7c74288f69f.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/79/39/fd/7939fd84b0e836f8d773f7c74288f69f.jpg)) is a B skill.

Hopefully this clears up some things and provides a bit of context. Definitely check out r/bodyweightfitness FAQ for more info, it's a useful resource!

Ok now to the calisthenics stuff!

* **Summer Before Senior Year**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=183](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=183)

Around June of 2019 is when I started. After doing research I decided I'd train for a front and back lever. I just YouTubed ""Front Lever"" tutorial and ""Back Lever"" tutorial and found a bunch of useful progressions and exercises which I incorporated into my lifting routine.

Essentially what I did was FL on pull and BL on push days. I trained PPLPP (or something like that I can't remember). The way I structured my workout was Static progressions in the beginning, then dynamics, then weights (which could be weighted calisthenics, bench, accessory workout etc.)

Overall, training was pretty straight forward and I got both moves before the end of the summer.

&#x200B;

* **Senior Year Semester 1**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=324](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=324)

Once the summer was over, I decided to continue my current training style. I focused on calisthenics with weights but now that I had FL and BL (with ok form. I also couldn't do it all the time) I decided I would work towards full planche.

So I pretty much continued in a similar training manner as I mentioned earlier and eventually got a full planche by the end of the semester (or about 4 months). Well, not really...Because my form was actually really bad and my elbows were bent so I wasn't actually doing a full planche. I didn't realize it at the time that I wasn't actually planching. Because I didn't know better I continued on thinking I was ready for harder moves.

I made a post regarding my planche mistake previously here if you want to take a look at that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/k1069j/full\_planche\_vs\_fake\_plache\_do\_it\_right\_the\_first/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/k1069j/full_planche_vs_fake_plache_do_it_right_the_first/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

* **Senior Year Semester 2**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=456](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=456)

When my last semester of Senior year started I joined the gymnastics club and made some really cool friends. I also had access to a gymnastics gym too. This is where I fell in love with rings and realized I wanted to train towards advanced ring moves.

So I started working towards Iron Cross and full planche on rings. I used the straps on forearms method to train for cross, but honestly it was mostly a waste of time. The straps didn't really develop the proper straight arm strength for cross, so other than some initial shoulder development I didn't find it useful.

I was also making fake progress on planche too (I thought it was real progress at the time). I progress all the way from tuck to a full planche (bent arms so it doesn't count) on rings. I also started exploring planche pushups but again the form was terrible.

On the bright side, my weighted calisthenics was going well. I increased my one rep max weighted pull and chinup to 2 plates. I also could do dips with a plate and a half with good form. I could also do 2 plates but it wasn't parallels so I don't count it. Oh I also got one arm chinups so that was also pretty awesome too!

&#x200B;

* **Summer**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=621](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=621)

So my senior year was a cut a bit short because COVID started at this point. I went back home around April 2020. I luckily made the smart decision to buy a power rack and continue training in my backyard and house which really payed off.

Earlier I started noticing there were weird quirks with my planche but I was still convinced I had a full planche. I posted a form check on reddit and someone pointed out my arms were bent. I was sad about it for a little while but eventually came to terms with it.

Again, check out the planche or YT video for more details b/c I'm mostly repeating myself. But TLDR I started from scratch, got injured from planche training for a few weeks, recovered, trained it some more but correctly (eblows locked) and eventually got a full planche.

For other moves Iron Cross was still a grind, I had to go through a few iterations and setups on how to train it to replace the strap method. I eventually ended on using resistance bands but my form always felt off so I was in an awkward limbo with the move.

On the bright side, around this time I started dabbling in other moves to improve on. They include front lever rows, one arm front lever, RTO dips, impossible dips, and victorian cross. I will never achieve these moves.

It was around this time I also found out about ""Overcoming Gravity 2"". I think it's really good and useful book. Great reference point for training and it helped me start thinking of other training concepts that I eventually started incorporating later on.

&#x200B;

* **Fall and Winter**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=936](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=936)

Once it started getting too cold to train outside, I moved my stuff inside and continued training. I made a good amount of progress during this time. All the foundational work I improved on over the summer began paying dividends.

I could actually full planche for a few seconds so I started working towards harder variations like full planche pushups and planche press.

Iron Cross was still kicking my ass so no real update there.

I managed to get a few reps of FL rows with a false grip and some of the other moves I was dabbling with over the summer where also improving. The most noteworthy one is that my victorian cross form was shaping up well. I was using lighter bands.

Really the main thing that happened during this time is the gradual progress I was making with most things I was training and the fact I incorporating some simple periodization. I spent a more time refreshing my knowledge of training and periodization was one thing that really stuck out to me. Incorporating that helped me feel less tired and in danger of hurting myself in the long run vs what I used to do (i.e. not take deload weeks)

&#x200B;

* **Now**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1050](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1050)

Ok at this point I got really strong. Training wise I had a good understanding of how my body worked and how I needed to structure my workouts that worked best for me. I also incorporated a bit more complex periodization (though it wasn't always consistent) where I would ramp up and build towards strength phases. Also, I bought a dream machine for cross training, it was pricey but I found it useful.

Here's some clips of some of the other things I've managed to achieve. A lot of this skills are quite advanced so I'm really proud of myself :)

* Full Planche, Full Planch Pushups, Full Planch on Rings, Full Planche Press to Handstand: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1050](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1050)
* Impossible Dips and 3 Plate Dip: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1135](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1135) (not bellow parallel so needs more work)
* Front Lever Rows and One Arm Front Lever: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1228](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1228)
* 3 Plate Chinup: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1254](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1254)
* Maltese: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1288](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1288)
* Victorian Cross: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1272](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1272) which was super sick, you rarely see this in the Olympics.
* and more

Still no iron cross...hate that move. The dream machine I bought has been much more helpful in training towards it bs bands though so that's nice. Slowly making progress on it now!

&#x200B;

* **Current Goals**:

I still love training calisthenics, my main life goal is to achieve F skills on rings eventually. Currently I'm focusing at the moment on getting Iron Cross, cleaning up my Maltese, Maltese Cross, and cleaning up my Victorian Cross

**Diet and Nutrition**:

* **General Info**:

I don't have much to say on my diet so this section is going to be brief. I'm in a lucky position where I've always been relatively skinny so I've never had to focus to much time on losing weight.

When I was in college, I was in a University that was ranked for having one of the best dinning services in the US. I always had access to healthy foods back then so my diet was varied and relatively clean with the occasional eating out. It was balanced as in I ate my fruits, veggies, grains, meats in most my meals. I couldn't tell you exactly what I ate because it was mostly intuitive. I don't count calories or anything.

Since college I've been living with my folks (moving out around April so that's exciting) and they cook every day. It's traditional Bengali dishes, so again food is generally clean and varied. I do however not eat as much veggies and fruits as I used back in college and need to fix that from a nutrition stand point. But over all I have an easy time maintaining a consistent weight. I also rarely drink alcohol.

* **Bulking and Cutting**: So I don't bulk or cut. I like slowly gaining weight over time. That's just me.
* **Supplementation**: I take creatine and protein powder that's it. I think most people do not ""need"" supplements, a good rule of thumb is to use supplements to enhance lagging parts of your diet. Actually requiring supplements is probably a conversation between you and your doctor.

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0\_7z6VscypA&t=1298s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_7z6VscypA&t=1298s)

This post is already pretty long now so I'll keep this section a bit short.

* Fitness has had a huge positive impact on my life! I'm so glad I started lifting weights in middle school :D. I hope everyone else also has an great fitness journey.
* Switching to calisthenics took my fitness journey to the next leve. I'm the strongest I've ever been because of it. This isn't because calisthenics is any better than other forms of training. I just have some much more fun training it which has helped me stay consistent and discplined.
* I've also met awesome people through it's really been a net positive in my life
* Be honest with yourself when you train, bad form can really waist your time or get you hurt.
* Hopefully this post was somewhat informative and peaks others interest into the wonderful world of bodyweight training (it's more than just calisthenics)

Disordered,"Discussion: Has anyone tried palm or extremity cooling to increase work volume (from Huberman Lab podcast, episode 19)?  I've been listening to the Huberman Lab podcast and in episode 19, he describes a study where cooling your palms in-between sets radically increased the number of reps a person can do (300% for dips!). 

The idea is that hyperthermia limits performance and cooling through the extremities prevents that.

Huberman claims that this methodology is being used by lots of sports teams and that they've been getting great results.

Frankly, this sounds way too good to be true. 

[There are a number of peer reviewed papers demonstrating the effect](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22076097/), however:

* They're from the original authors, who started a company to commercialize the technology
* The company was founded in 2000 and don't appear to have been able to bring anything to market in the last 20 years.
* I found a couple examples of replications that don't show anything like the effect size the original authors see, plus the results don't show a proper dose/response.

I'm tempted to try this myself to see if there's any validity to the claims (easy enough experiment and claimed gains are enormous).

Disordered,"OVERTRAINED: 50 consecutive days of deadlifting 605-750+ pounds, and what I learned along the way  **TLDR:** **I Deadlifted over 600lb every day for 50 days, and came out the other side stronger, and better for it.** 

In the process I took my 1RM from **712 to 752** (323->341kg), and hit a bunch of other PR’s along the way.

---

**Background Info**

I started lifting with my dad as a young kid. I am in my mid-thirties now. There were some extended breaks from training over the years, but I always maintained an active physical lifestyle playing sports, working construction, etc. 

You can find more detailed background information in my previous program writeups.

* [Simple Jack’d 2x](https://removeddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/lrg0tt/program_review_simple_jackd_2x_3_months_of_high/)

*(Links are to removeddit, give them time to load)*

So fast forward a bit, and we get to spring 2021. I just wrapped up *”Simple Jack’d”*, and decided to sign up for a meet. Now I had to decide how to train for it.

---

**Enter – DLED – Deadlift Every Day**

Over the years I have experimented with many different setups for high frequency training. From my earliest attempts of mimicking the *""Bulgarian Method""* of maxing out every day, to *""Simple Jack’d’s""* more reserved setup of a 6 rep daily minimum, I have learned a lot.
I decided to start this program with a new approach, similar to *""Simple Jack’d""*, but with some rules.

1)	Deadlift 3 reps at 85% Every Day.   
2)	Deadlift 1 Rep at 95% once per week.  
3)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.  

If the week goes well and all the reps are completed, add 1 rep, or 1% to the daily minimum, and move onto week 2. Maintain the weekly 1 rep minimum at the same intensity unless I  set a new 1RM PR.

[**In the end, this is how my 50 days of programming looked.**](https://imgur.com/a/3rqWd7v)

* Week 1: 3 reps at 605 Every Day, 1 at 675+ Every Week
* Week 2: 3 reps at 610 Every Day, 1 at 675+ Every Week
* Week 3: 4 reps at 610 Every Day, 1 at 675+ Every Week
* Week 4: 4 reps at 615 Every Day, 1 at 675+ Every Week
* Week 5: 5 reps at 615 Every Day, 1 at 690+ Every Week
* Week 6: 5 reps at 635 Every Day, 1 at 690+ Every Week
* Week 7: 1 rep at 675 Every Day, 1RM Conventional and Sumo
* Day 50: 700 AMRAP

**DLED Accessories/Assistance**

I decided to pair my high frequency low volume deadlifting, with the polar opposite for accessory work. A basic, single muscle group per day, “Bro Split”. I would hit that single muscle group with high volume of a single lift, and then move on.

**Cardio**
I [ran 171 miles](https://imgur.com/a/ZNkO9Po) over the course of these 50 days. An average of 3.4 miles per day. My longest run was 8 miles.

I strongly believe that a good base of cardiovascular fitness enables me to work harder, longer, and in the end, lift more weight.

**Training Log/Highlights**

My full deadlift training log for these 50 days can be found [in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K5QE-2xhDuRMh3LIGg5N7aONbVOcy-VV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105219797917450253924&rtpof=true&sd=true) with videos of the top set each day hyperlinked in the log.

**Data / Summary**

Overall I hit 187 reps over 600lb in 50 days, for a total volume of 120,252 lb. That's makes the average day 3-4 reps at 640+

The lowest daily weight I hit was 605, the highest was 752 off the floor, and 815 off of wagon wheels with the top set estimating out to 889 on day 50 ([702x8](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sJztQowXHAr0G3hi-cGUUHlFwRxytpk0/view?usp=drivesdk))

Of those reps, 134 were hook grip, and 53 were strapped, 32 were conventional, and 155 were sumo.

---

**Using Variation to combat Fatigue**

If you look through the training log, or have followed any of my comments in the weightroom daily discussion threads, you’ll notice that I used a LOT of variation throughout the last 50 days.

These variations weren’t chosen entirely haphazardly. In fact, I put a lot of thought into what I was going to do each day/week ahead of time, and then paid close attention to how I felt to adjust along the way.

Here are a couple examples of how lift selection could facilitate recovery or increase stimulus without just adding/decreasing weight:

* When my [thumbs were hurting](https://imgur.com/a/YJl0kQj) I would use straps
* If my hips felt good I would pull sumo
* If my lower back was feeling good, I would pull conventional
* If my lower back and hips were both feeling good I would go heavier, and hit more than my daily minimum intensity
* If my upper back felt strong and rested, but I didn’t want to overwork my lower back or hips, I would add bands or chains, increasing the intensity at the top of the lift, without increasing demands at the bottom
* When my positioning felt sloppy, I would add paused reps.

Every variation had a purpose, and was chosen to fit that day based on how I felt when I woke up, and in the hours leading up to my training.

---

**Diet, Sleep, Recovery**

My starting weight was 228 and my ending weight was 225, a net loss of 3lb

I tracked calories for a bit at the beginning of this 50 day period, but stopped about halfway through. At the time I was eating around 4,200 calories per day and maintaining. 

As for *what* I eat... it varies, but I'm a big fan of carbs. I aim for 180g+ of protein,  100g+ of fat, and then fill in the remaining with 600+g of carbs

I usually start the day with some sort of PB&J, my favorite is to [Toast a Blueberry Bagel, add Chunky Peanut Butter, Honey, Raspberry Jelly, Fruity Pebbles]() and maybe a banana. 

Mid day I usually eat out, because I work pretty far from home. My go-tos are burritos, sandwiches, pizza, all the good stuff people tell you to avoid if you are a serious lifter... I eat it.

Dinner is usually whatever my wife makes, it changes all the time due to kids, and I don't worry too much about it.

If I am hungry, I eat more.

If I'm tired, I eat more.

If I'm sore, I eat more.

If I am feeling achy or run down? I'll eat a bunch of gummy worms and drink a half gallon of OJ, then go for a run.

I don't take / never have taken steroids. Due to a pituitary tumor I have [multiple recent blood tests](https://imgur.com/a/o1xQk6F) showing my T levels, and offer my physique as further evidence.



I try to go to sleep before 10:00pm every night, and usually wake up around 5:00am

I do LISS cardio as often as possible, preferably in more frequent, shorter doses

*(I find that two 5ks are easier to recover from than a single 10k)*

---

**CNS fatigue and overtraining**

You see it all the time on internet forums. 
“You cant do X, you’ll overtrain”, or “Deadlifts are too taxing on the CNS to do more than a single set of 5 per week”

Obviously that’s ridiculous. 

Now, I am not going to say overtraining isn’t real, or that it doesn’t happen. It does. But it is just REALLY hard to get to that point if you are paying attention to the other variables. 

If deadlifting 600-750 for reps every day for weeks on end, while also running [171 miles](https://imgur.com/a/ZNkO9Po) doesn’t result in overtraining, you are probably going to be OK adding that 3rd set of curls to the end of your 5x5 LP

The key is to focus on what I mentioned above in diet/sleep/recovery. 

Eat, sleep, do your conditioning. 

**Pain and Injury**

I’ve dealt with many injuries over the years, from broken bones and torn muscles, to herniated discs, jambs, sprains, and dislocations…. and I had a few little bangs and tweaks over the last 50 days as well.

Going into this, I hadn’t pulled with a hook grip on a regular basis. Within the first week [I had bruising on both thumbs, a split in my thumb nail, and a tear on two fingers](https://imgur.com/a/YJl0kQj). It took some adjustment, but I learned how to fix my grip, and was able to train through the discomfort, to the point that I am now comfortable holding 750+lb without issue, and my thumbs are all healed up.

I also [smashed my toes](https://imgur.com/a/DesKPOx) one day, they bled a bit and bruised badly. I thought that my middle toe may have been broken, but a bit of tape holding it to the other toes, and some caution while running was enough to let me push through it. Although it is still hurting to this day.

Then, on day 46 I tweaked something in my lower back [pulling 700 beltless](https://imgur.com/a/Zg3NPrP). I actually felt a bit of a pop and immediately dropped to the ground. Everyone has heard of R.I.C.E. (rest, ice, compression, elevation) but I refused to let a back injury sidetrack me again. 

I **immediately** started working at it. Instead of RICE I opted for **MEAT/METH**, Motion, Elevation, Analgesics, Treatment/Traction, and Heat. What this means, is that I didn’t just lay down. I started foam rolling, stretching, taking Ibuprofin, working the area with a lacrosse ball, heat packs, hot baths, hot showers, walking, and even some light jogging, etc.

On day 47 I woke up in the morning STIFF and SORE. I immediately attacked the issue again with the same ***Meth***ods. Later on I was able to [Deadlift 675 off wagon wheels](https://imgur.com/a/8f2RP2C), which reduced the ROM to the point of less discomfort, and got out for a nice run without too much pain.

On day 48 I was already feeling significantly better, but I was still stiff and sore. Once again, I employed the same methods and rehabbed my way through the pain until I could touch my toes with straight knees, and pick up my kids without holding my breath. Later that day I would [pull 765 pounds off of wagon wheels](https://imgur.com/a/cidrMI7) again. This time with even less discomfort than the day before.

On day 49 I woke up feeling like I was back to 80+%. But I took the time, and the medicine, and worked through the same drills and stretches. Later that day I would [pull 675 off the floor](https://imgur.com/a/mlN6iqK) for my first full ROM deadlift since the injury, and then go on to [pull 765, and 815](https://imgur.com/a/mlN6iqK) off the wagon wheels, ending with a nice big PR.

On day 50, I felt great, and finished with a big [702x8](https://imgur.com/a/F6ltIXw) deadlift AMRAP for a new all time PR on my estimated max… and did so completely pain free. 

I am still a bit tight and sore in the morning, but its improving every day, and I am diligent about working at it. Staying moving, working the area, taking basic meds like Ibuprofen, foam rolling, stretching, and even lifting all make a huge difference on healing faster.

**Conclusion**

This couldn’t have gone better. At the outset I had no idea I was about to put 40lb on my deadlift 1RM in only 50 days. 

[**Starting 1RM: 712 vs  Ending 1RM: 752**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lLbVGr8sXoPsYXhab3yQHSLJtWB6WRJD/view?usp=sharing)

And better yet, I learned a lot about myself, about training, about diet, and recovery, about pain and fatigue management, and more.

Is your deadlift stalling? Should you go deadlift 600+ Every day now? 

Probably not. 

But if you look at your training, I'm sure there is room to do **MORE...**

Disordered,"My Guide/Review For The most effective muscle gain training/Nutrition Protocol I have followed: 5/3/1 BBB Beefcake-Building the monolith-Deep Water  **INTRO**

About a year ago, I proposed an idea for a weight gaining training block that was effectively stringing together the most effective weight gaining blocks I had used in an ascending order of difficulty.  It went 5/3/1 BBB Beefcake, 5/3/1 Building the Monolith, Deep Water Beginner and Deep Water Intermediate, with deloads as appropriate.  It was a bit uncharacteristic of me, as I tend to only vouch for approaches I’ve personally used, and though I had run all these programs individually, I had never run them in this order as a training block.  I figured it would work well enough, but then my schedule opened up and I found myself with the opportunity to actually run the full 26 week program…and discovered it was even MORE effective than I could have possibly imagined.  What I intend to do here is document my experience in running the whole programming block, takeaways and lessons learned.

**RESULTS?**

It’s going to upset quite a few people that I never weighed myself for this weight gain program, but if you read through any of my program reviews you’ll most likely understand why: shift work makes my lifestyle pretty crazy.  Getting a pre-breakfast/post bowel movement weigh in was a luxury I simply couldn’t afford in most cases, which meant weigh ins that I COULD get would be wildly inconsistent with too many variables in play.  In full disclosure, I was concerned that the data would screw with my head and make me compromise my nutrition, so I just skipped the scale and focused on the mirror and the weights moved in the weightroom.  So with that, I’ve got some not great before and after photos of the whole process, and I ended up deadlifting 405lbs for 100 reps in 8 sets, which is something I’ve literally never done in my life before.  I am legitimately the strongest I’ve ever been while being significantly leaner than I ever was at previous strength levels.

**THOUGHTS ON HOW THE PROGRAMS ALL FIT TOGETHER**

* These programs just feed incredibly well into each other.  Starting off with BBB Beefcake does a great job of getting you acclimatized to higher volume work if you’ve been staying low volume.  5x10 is an excellent wake up call, and the heavier percentages of Beefcake compared to traditional BBB absolutely push the trainee hard enough that they’re gonna need to eat big to recover.  I actually found the 5s progression on the main work to be one of the more challenging aspects of the program, specifically on the final weeks of the cycle, and often found myself dreading THAT part the most.  

* Going into Building the Monolith from BBB Beefcake, things transform a little.  BtM by itself seems like it’s really high volume, but when you run it after Beefcake it ACTUALLY feels more like an intensification block.  You’re lifting higher percentages for lower reps across multiple sets for most of your barbell work.  Suddenly, those 5s pro top sets you were doing in BBB Beefcake have become 3-5x5 sets.  It’s INTENSE.  I found it helpful to set my training max for BtM as the same lifts I used for the final cycle of BBB Beefcake (so repeating my previous TMs) vs advancing them between the two programs, as it meant I’d be ending week 3 doing 3-5x5 with a weight I had previously only managed 1 set with.  Again: that sort of foreboding presence puts the fear in you so that you NEED to eat to be able to succeed.  Meanwhile, the growing volume is in the assistance work, which will actually be a pretty nice break for you.  BBB can beat you up, as it’s a LOT of barbell work and fairly heavy, whereas now we’re doing dips, chins, pull aparts, etc.  Make the most of it.

* On the above, BtM is going to be the program that beats you down the most by TOTALLY owning your life, ASSUMING you are running it correctly.  Anyone that tells me it’s a 3 day program earns a special place on my list of ire.  BtM is a SIX day program.  You lift weights 3 days, and then you do CONDITIONING 3 days.  The conditioning is KEY.  If you do not do it, you are only doing half the program, and if you’re doing the full diet of a dozen eggs and 1.5lbs of ground beef a day, you’re going to get fat.  But if you do the conditioning, that diet will be enough to help you survive.  Every time I’ve run BtM, I’ve developed some sort of scheduling anxiety, because there is so little wiggle room with 6 day a week training.  Also, you really SHOULD get a prowler for this program.  Prowlers are just plain awesome in general, but they’re especially awesome for recovering from squat soreness, as they have no eccentric movement.  An Aidryne would be cool too, but I sold mine because I don’t care to have it for home workout equipment.  I think it’s a GREAT piece of cardio equipment, but I train in the VERY early AM, and an airdyne sounds like you’re mowing your lawn inside your house.

* Going from Monolith into Deep Water Beginner is, once again, a system shock, and I feel like that’s actually what makes this training block so effective.  These programs already work in isolation, but the whole way that periodization works is to basically introduce a stimulus to the body until it’s no longer effective and then to change the stimulus.  If we stay with the same method/approach for too long, we get stale.  So many folks “try” to do this, but are so afraid to venture away from their comfort zones that it’s just paying lip service.  “Instead of 5x5, I’ll do THREE sets of 5!”  Instead, we bounced from 5x10 to 5x5 to 10x10, and now the weight never changes but the rest times DO.  This is why you wanna make sure you’ve absolutely blasted the conditioning work up to this point, because if you didn’t, it will show and you will be hurting.  Your ability to recover between sets is crucial.  Also on that note, weeks 1 and 2 should NOT be a nutkick.  You should NOT be going into Deep Water on those weeks.  I saw a lot of people dork up this program by not feeling like these weeks were challenging enough and upping the weights.  Then they got to weeks 5 and 6 and couldn’t complete them.  You’re going to be resting HALF as long between sets when this is all done: weeks 1 and 2 SHOULD feel a little easy.

* I shouldn’t need to write this, but apparently I do: don’t skip out on the clean pulls on back day, don’t swap out the barbell rows, and do the shrugs with a barbell.  That entire day is prepping you for the intermediate program, wherein you will be doing 100 power cleans.  The clean pulls are teaching you how to get power from the starting position, the rows are about keeping a strong torso during the transition, and the shrug is for the final pull.  There is a method to the madness.  

* For picking weights on this program, I didn’t want to bother testing 1rms, nor did I want to use my training maxes.  Since I had done sets of 10 on BBB Beefcake, I figure I had a pretty good idea of what a challenging set of 10 would be, so I took the weights I used on the final week of BBB Beefcake, took 5-10lbs off of them, and used those for my Deep Water workout weights.  This proved REALLY effective.  I knew I could get 5x10 of these done with about 2-3 minutes of rest between sets, so, once again, I had the fear in me necessary to know I was gonna need to eat BIG if I wanted to get twice as many sets done with only 2 minutes of rest.

* Intermediate feeds logically from beginner because these programs were actually meant to be run like that, but it’s still cool how awesome Deep Water is set up.  I, once again, did no 1rm testing nor did I use any calculators.  At this point, my conditioning was so through the roof that I was stupidly “10 rep adapted”, and trying to run the Deep Water calculator in reverse was having it spit out insane 1rms (like a 750lb deadlift), so I employed some “Kentucky windage” and added 20-30lbs to everything and went from there.  

* Something that’s really cool when all of this is done: if you did it right, you end up moving for 10x10 MORE weight than what you were doing for 5x10 at the end of BBB Beefcake. That’s a GREAT feeling.

**HELPFUL MODIFICATIONS**

* For Beefcake, I ran it 3/5/1 vs 5/3/1, meaning that the middle week was the lightest week.  I like doing this because it gives you something like a mini deload before the heaviest week.  I also took to changing the challenge level without playing with the weights.  For dealifts, I’d do the 3s week with a powerlifting bar, the 5s week with an axle, and the 1s week with a deadlift bar.  The weights were all as prescribed, but challenge still shifted.  For the press, I would clean the first rep of each set on the 3s week, clean every rep on the 5s week, and take the weight out of the rack on the 1s week.  

* I ended up appreciating the effect of cleaning the weight from the floor for presses that I did it through all the other programs.  For BtM, once again I played around such that I clean only the first rep on the heaviest week.  For the 3s week, I’d clean every rep.  For the 5s week, I used a log and did viper presses.  This all creates a great metabolic demand on the body, which will compel you to eat more. 

* For the widowmakers on BtM, I ended up taking them until I couldn’t do any more reps, rather than stop at 20. I felt like this was better prep for Deep Water.

* Not a modification, but just a helpful tip: get decent straps for deadlifting.  You’ll want them for Deep Water.

**NUTRITION**

* When I threw together the training block, I included the associated nutritional recommendations by author.  For BBB Beefcake, I took the diet Jim included with the 3 month BBB challenge, as they’re honestly the same thing: Beefcake just takes that challenge and turns it into a 3 WEEK challenge, and runs it twice.  Monolith was the dozen eggs and 1.5lbs of ground beef, Deep Water was Deep Water.  As for what I PERSONALLY did, I ran what I deemed “Deep Mountain”, which was effectively the Deep Water diet BUT, if I deviated, it was a Mountain Dog approved deviation ala John Meadows (RIP John, you’ll be missed).  Ultimately all this boiled down to was adding some VERY dark chocolate to my diet (92-100%) and including a small amount of grassfed butter with my breakfast, along with focusing on ensuring my fat sources were organic and, if animal, came from an animal fed it’s natural diet.  I actually tried adding in some more diverse foods, to include wild blueberries, but found that they were upsetting my digestion.  I also had to stop eating walnuts for similar reasons.  I’m 35 now, and finding, as I get older, my body develops intolerances and sensitivities rather easily.  I still try to get diversity in my diet, but when you’re eating a TON of food ALL the time to support growth, you eventually have to settle on a “greatest hits” playlist of foods that DON’T cause issues.  One bad bit of digestion can really throw off the plan.

* Big takeaway is that the whole reason you are doing this is to gain weight.  The training is INSANELY difficult, and if you are too afraid to eat, you’ll get crushed.  I was able to prove to myself that you don’t need to eat junk to get there.  And, something kind of interesting: when you are absolutely stuffing yourself with GOOD food (don’t be coy and stupid: you know what good food is), you have no craving for junk.  My only craving was for NO food.  Missing meals sounded awesome.

**CONDITIONING**

* As stated, BtM has its own pre-defined conditioning.  BBB Beefcake just says to balance it against the supplemental work, and Deep Water has the active recovery day built in and that’s about it.  If it’s your first time running these programs, that should all be fine.  For myself, I wanted to really push the envelope and took it upon myself to do some form of conditioning every day (as in 7 days a week), and often multiple conditioning sessions in a day.  The intent was two fold here.  One: when I started this training block, I was the leanest I had ever been and got there with a diet that had me SIGNIFICANLTY slash my dietary fats, and I was concerned my hormones were suffering as a result.   I wanted to intake a LOT of dietary fats as a means of course correction, and doing so much conditioning was a way to ensure that all this energy I was taking in got put to good use.  The second reason was that I find conditioning work, when done correctly, has a tonic effect on the body and can promote recovery between workouts.  The first time I ran Deep Water, I would walk like a toy soldier 6 days out of every week because my legs were so sore.  In my experience, crossfit style barbell WODs and prowler pushing were both VERY helpful for recovery.  To get rid of quad soreness, I’d use WODs that were thruster focused.  For whole body soreness, things like Grace of WODs with some manner of floor to overhead were awesome.  I found burpees a good way to recover from deadlifts, as they didn’t place any load on the body but still required the whole body to move through space.

* I also included a front squat based conditioning workout that I kept the entire time I ran all the programs.  For the majority of the 26 week block it was the “Juarez Valley” workout, where I’d open with a high rep topset (something along the realm of 8-16 reps), do 5 burpees, then do 1 rep, 5 burpees, then 1 rep less than the highest rep of the topset (so if I opened with 8, this would be 7 reps), 5 burpees, 2 reps, etc, meet in the middle.  For the final few weeks of Deep Water Intermediate, I used something I deemed “Tower of Babel”, which operated in a similar manner.  For this one, you started with 1 rep, did the buprees, then 2 reps, burpees, 3 reps, etc, building to a point where you can’t do any more reps, and then you work BACKWARDS to 1.  Both are absolutely brutal.  I’d chase the workout with a belt squat stripset and just absolutely nuke my quads.  This was my “active recovery” workout on Deep Water, and replaced the airdyne workout for Building the Monolith.  For BBB Beefcake, it was done typically after the deadlift day.

* The real benefit of all this focus on conditioning shone through during Deep Water.  The very first time I ran that program, I had to legit lay on the floor between sets once I got to about the 6th or 7th set.  I was just EXHAUSTED.  This time around, it certainly wasn’t a FUN experience, but I never had to go to the floor.  I stayed standing during all of my rests.  I was draped over my reverse hyper, sure, but that’s about my standing resting position. And being able to recover so well between sets meant I absolutely crushed the workouts.

* All of that said: keep the goal the goal.  If your conditioning is taxing your recovery to the point you can’t succeed in training, back it off. If you cannot eat enough to recover from conditioning, back it off.

**WHAT IF I’M NOT READY?**

* Just by happenstance, I had run 2 cycles of 5/3/1 SVR II before this training block, and I think that was about the best thing I could have done.  SVR II has Widowmakers, BBB and Second Set Last 5x5 all built into it, which will give you a sampling of things to come over the next 6 months. A few cycles of it will do you good.

**CONCLUSION**

* 26 weeks is a LONG time to spend gaining weight, so make sure you have a clear schedule, a reliable source of steady nutrition, and a lot of fortitude.  If you are prepared, this could very well be the most effective training protocol you ever employ.  It was for me."

Neutral,"Bulgarian Bag for strength...?  What are people's thoughts on using a heavier-than-recommended Bulgarian bag?

It's generally used as a strength-endurance-cardio tool that is centred around lower back and core strength in the transverse plane, along with grip and shoulder endurance.

Usually you see the bag used for 10-12 reps, switch exercise, another 10-12 reps, repeat, through several exercises without rest.

I see this as something akin to doing barbell complexes, which are great, but not necessarily conducive to pure strength/power, and more of a strength endurance thing bordering on cardio/HIIT.

So what if one were to use a bag heavier than that recommended, sticking within a range where 4-8 reps would be max effort, then taking a break, then repeating for another 3-4 sets? It's normally recommended than a reasonably athletic male should start with a 12kg bag, then move to a 17kg then 22kg eventually. But I'm thinking of a scenario where one would begin with a 22kg and move potentially to a 30kg.

I guess one could also slow down the movements somewhat, focusing less on the skill of the movement and more on strength/time under tension. Another parallel; heavy kettlebells where movements such as the overhead press are performed seated and with strict form.

This matter is interesting to me because I don't see it explored much anywhere, and it is an incredibly versatile piece of equipment, and I love the core stability benefits offered in that transverse plane which is something that isn't targeted by conventional weight lifting programmes.

Thanks."

Disordered,"My 6 year weight lifting journey (need constructive criticism)  I've decide to make this post because other transformation post(s) seem to be receiving very helpful information. Firstly I want to clarify that I wasn't clear and concise on lifting for 6 years straight. I've stopped for a year, stopped during summers, etc. So realistically I'd say its 4ish years of total lifting. Started at 18, currently 24

**Training phase:**

First two years I really tried focusing on form and dieting, but information wasn't readily available like it is today. But as of recently fitness has been exploding. I started with random weights and no goal in mind. I wasn't aware of how much volume and muscle growth was possible within a certain time frame. So literally just messed around for 1-2 years.

Third year was when I started taking things more seriously. This was where half of my current gains occurred. WATCHING informative videos, reading articles with scientific backing helped significantly. 100gram protein intake. Chicken every morning and beef at night. Also protein shakes occasionally. My training got more serious as well because things started to hurt less after my form was fixed. At this point I'm 115lb. I was mostly hitting around 3-4 sets and 6-8 reps with about 1 hour workout. Training got very difficult because I wasn't seeing much, so less motivation to work harder. But turns out it was my lack of food.

4th year was where I got into everything precisely. I went from 115lb to 130lb with the help of mass gainer and pb&j. Everyone says that mass gainer isn't helpful or its just loaded with sugar. But in the end, it helped me put on more than 10lb of muscle and serious mass ;). This was over a 1 year period. My training also got more intense. From one hour workouts to 2-3 hours. Shooting around 5-6sets, 6-15 reps, and 3 workouts per muscle group. Hitting every muscle group twice a week. The most mass and strength was gained the 4th year because everything was aligned. Dieting, training, and sleep. At one point, I trained so hard that I had erectile dysfunction and 24/7 fatigue. So i had to back off on the sets and go at a slower pace.

I have been having issues getting the right amount of calories and macros due to appetite, if diet was perfect I should weight much more. But I'm not sure, so I'd like to see what you guys have to say. I'm planning to do a natural physique in men's if I get my dieting right by next summer. But it could possibly be much longer than that.

My form is fine on most lifts. Just depth issues for squat due to hamstring/ankle mobility. I cannot go ATC due to tension loss past hip and knee alignment. Shoulders sometimes have extreme pain if I touch chest with bar on bench (yes form is perfect). My lifting forms/routine are based off of Jeff Nippard and Renaissance periodization youtube videos.

I've been trying to eat 5 times a day and protein intake has been 100grams. Caloric intake is 1500, I want to reach 8% by the end of summer. Workouts isn't as great in an attempt to cut down in bf. But it seems like I might be 120lb at 8%. At 2000-2500 I'd be gaining fat. So 1500 is the threshold for losing weight.

My current target is 160lb at 12%bf. Im assuming that at 160lb, my daily caloric intake should be 2500kcal. As i have a few friends who are at that bw with 2500kcal daily. But because of my current weight, 2500 would add a lot more fat than help with muscle gains. I've tried a increase of calories in a short time but it added lots of fat on. I got 160lb because that seems to be the near genetic muscular potential for my body composition based off this website. https://mennohenselmans.com/ffmi-calculator/"

Disordered,"Anything Can Be A PR: Broadening Your Horizons To Eliminate Plateaus  **Five Point Summary:**

-At a certain point fixating on and structuring your short/mid-term goals around a narrow group of lifts becomes detrimental, both mentally and in terms of progress. 

-Expanding the scope of the PRs you chase and track, in terms of new lifts, new variations, and new rep ranges, is a solution to this problem. 

-Improvements in new areas can later contribute to improvements in old areas. 

-When comparing your current lifts to lifts you've previously performed, consider the context of both sets. 

-A proposed application of these ideas into a loose training structure. 

**Introduction**: 

Yesterday I made [this comment with some disjointed ideas on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/ovbe70/controversial_training_myths/h7b4dkh/). I haven't been able to get the desire to expand, structure and otherwise clean up the ideas out of my head so here we are. This will be a short description of the need for, benefit of, and application of the ""anything can be a PR"" mindset. I will clarify here that this is not necessarily good advice for beginners. I won't say exactly where it starts to apply, because saying 'this is for intermediates and up' bases the recommendation on one of the most poorly and inconsistently defined classifications in lifting, but I feel like this kind of approach and mindset will probably push a beginner into a pattern of 'fuckarounditits' due to the fact that a beginner is probably not plateauing for the same reasons as a more experienced lifter. With that said let's jump in. 

**The Problem**: 

The problem I am hoping to address and offer a solution to is a fixation that many lifters have on a narrow selection of lifts when determining what represents a PR/goal. The most common collection of goals/relevant PRs to lifters is probably the Squat/Bench/Deadlift (SBD) 1 rep max (RM). They are ubiquitous lifts, anyone who is lifts knows about them and can probably appreciate them. Maximum single rep is also probably seen as the gold standard for 'strength' the majority of lifters, or at least the most significant minority. The most common goals I see in progress posts or comments establishing goals revolve around improving 1RM in lifts like these. I know that there are several other fairly common examples but I won't list them all here.  Now these are NOT bad goals, nor unimportant PRs. In fact they are great goals and exciting PRs as far as I am concerned. I care about, push for and track my 1RM in all of these lifts and more. The issue comes about when these are the ONLY goals you set/PRs you care about. 

Lifting offers diminishing returns, that's just the sad fact of it. Progress will always become progressively slower the better you get. Weekly increases in SBD 1RM become monthly increases, become yearly increases, become multi-year increases. A lifter will rapidly reach a point where the positive feedback of getting a new PR or meeting a goal becomes less and less frequent. This kills motivation. There is boatloads of research on the importance of regular positive feedback, small victories, and the like in the preservation of motivation and productivity. If you cut off the stream of achievement and results you slowly erode your motivation and damage your mindset. Beyond that even the most disciplined lifter who cares fuck all about motivation and will go to the gym and bust ass like some kind of forklift robot will still see reduced progress and results from continuously pounding their head against a wall when plateaued in an effort to reach a new level on the same lifts. Trying again and again with the same approach when it has not worked before is not determination, it's [insanity.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itjmKlYjUak&ab_channel=PassandoStress)

**Broadening Your Horizons:**

The solution to this fixation and inevitable stagnation is change, and one way to create that change is to expand the scope of what is a PR and what goals you set. Lets look at an example of this:

-*Your initial goal/tracked PR*: Squat 1RM. 

-*The expanded list of potential goals/PRs you could* ***also*** *set and track*: Squat 10RM, Squat 20RM, Safety Squat Bar Squats, Front Squat, Buffalo bar, Giant Camber Bar, Spider Bar, Split Squat, Zercher, Paused Squat, Wide Stance, Narrow Stance, fucking LOG BACK SQUAT, for 1/5/10/15/20/25RM, for 5x5, 10x10, most in a minute, most in a single breath, best 1RM wearing a diving suit, whatever. 

The list is almost endless. You can pick ANYTING to be a goal and eventual PR. And it can be just as rewarding and valuable as your barbell back squat 1RM once you adopt the proper mindset. Chase any of the above for weeks or months, as long as you can while making consistent progress. But once you hit a plateau^1 just let it go, you do not need to keep grinding with minimal progress towards that same goal, there is a very long list of new goals to reach and new PRs to set. If you rotate enough variations of movement, rep range, bar, ect you can be making near weekly progress almost indefinitely instead of sitting on a plateau baking in the sun seeing very little return for your lifting investment. And when you eventually cycle back around to the same lifts, bars, rep ranges, ect you will have grown so much bigger and stronger in a general sense that you will be ready to see rapid progress again. 

^1 *I'm going to make a footnote here. A plateau is not a bad day, it's a prolonged period of stagnation. Please don't read this and start whipping around to different goals a programming every time you don't do strictly better than the last session. Give things *some* time and make sure your fundamentals are in order before you start calling things plateaus and jumping ship. This is very important for newer lifters as you almost certainly are 'plateauing' for reasons that are unrelated to the lift itself and will just carry over to any new goals you make. 
*
I am speaking from personal experience when I make these suggestions. I spent over a year gaining only 10lbs on my SBD 1RM total. Not per lift, that was on my entire total. After I hit my first big plateau I kept trying to beat those lifts, they were what I cared about. I trained harder, longer, and all I had to show for it was a 10lb jump to my squat and some various injuries. The programs that turned this around for me were Deep Water (Beginner and Intermediate) by Jon Anderson and Average to Savage 2.0 (A2S2) by Greg Nuckols. 

To give a brief description of each Deep Water (DW) has a progression based on 100 rep days in the big barbell compounds. Beginner uses 10x10s dropping the rest period every other week, and Intermediate takes those 100 reps and has you complete them in a progressively lower number of sets. A2S2 has you working on 10 different lifts (an upper body and a lower body lift each day in the 5-day version I use), progressing through a range of weights and rep ranges, with as many reps as possible (AMRAP) sets each day on the last set. 

I ran DW first, it came on the tail end of over a year of fruitlessly pushing a butchered version of 531 BBB. With this program the goal was not 1RM, it was 100 reps. That is massively different. The first week was awful, with 4 minutes rest between each set of 10. The next time was still awful, with 3 minutes between sets, but I completed it. And that was a PR. That was quantifiable progress that I could see and be proud of. This continued down to 2 minutes, and into intermediate where I ended up being able to complete all 100 reps in 7 sets (1 less than the last weeks required) with increased weight. That was huge progress in only 12 weeks, it was the first serious achievement I had felt since setting my last SBD 1RM over a year beforehand. In my mind I had done more in those 12 weeks than I had done in the previous ~70. 

Later on I did A2S2 and once again I got to experience regular, consistent progress in the 7 lifts that were not barbell Squat, Bench and Dead. Every week was a PR. I was developing muscles in ways I had not before because I was pushing new movements in new rep ranges. Every time I came back to a rep range I had done before, or a weight I had done before I knew what I had done the last time and was driven to beat it by *just a bit*. There were sets I would have probably called earlier but I was *so close* to that new PR that I powered through. 

This broadening of my views on what goals could be and what PRs were worth thinking about and tracking not only returned motivation and enjoyment to my workouts, but fed into progress in my initial goals. After that long plateau I have had regular progress on my SBD 1RM, adding 150lbs to my total in ~2 years after the ~1.5 years that gave only 10lbs. 

These days I am spending less and less time focusing on SBD 1RM, keeping my time and focus on new goals, which makes me bigger and stronger and enables me to get PRs when my focus comes back to S, B, or D 1RM. 

What it all boils down to is by changing your focus regularly you can maintain a steady stream of progress in the short term. This not only has the benefit of keeping your training mentally rewarding, but also forces you out of your 'comfort zone' by making you train your body in new ways, this builds your overall strength and size, and that will ultimately help with everything else.

**Thinking About Context**: 

Now the above is the idealized version of this mindset. The reality is that most people are not going to take such a flexible approach to training and goals. Most people will always have pet goals or specific movements/bars/rep ranges that they care about more. Everyone has a favorite child. And these favored lifts will probably stay in your training regularly, even if progress is slow.  I will fully admit that even I can't/won't fully jump into this philosophy. So when you refuse to give up on a lift for a while you need to keep context in mind when looking at your results in the short term. 

Imagine this scenario. You are at the tail end of program that heavily focuses on bench. The program has been tapering down and peaking you for a 1RM test in the final week. You hit a new PR on bench in that final week. You move on to a new program that's more focused on general hypertrophy, with heavier volume on arms (specifically triceps) and less dedicated bench work. Halfway through this program you have reason to try a bench 1RM and you absolutely shit the bed, losing 20lbs on what you can do for 1 rep. Did you get weaker, did you bench get worse, should you feel terrible about it? No, to all of the above, the *context* is just different. You went from an ideal scenario for bench 1RM (lots of bench focused training, a body that has been permitted to shed fatigue and peak) versus a shitty scenario for bench 1RM (not much bench practice, a more heavily fatigued body, particularly crucial muscles like the triceps). You cant expect to perform the same in both situations. 

Now imagine you keep training your bench in this program, and a similar program afterwards. Maybe 6 months later, if not more, you finally manage to tie your old 1RM PR. Did you just now finally catch up to where you were? Again, no, you got a lot stronger. You managed to get the same lift in a much less conducive environment. If you go forward, train with a dedicated focus on bench again and let your body peak you are going to smash your old PR, almost guaranteed.

Continuing on this train of thought, I want to propose that turning an old 1RM PR into a single you can hit regularly in any kind of training situation is a huge accomplishment in of itself. In fact I would say that this should be the number one goal for the lifts you can't quite drop from your training but have accepted need to move to the backburner. I do not feel like I have stagnated when a lift has not gone up, provided I have maintained it in a context that is not good for that lift. For example, just today I hit a single on bench equal to an old PR from the end of last year. This was lower than my current 1RM PR. At first my reaction was to be disappointed, but that is wrong. I am benching once a week (versus 3+ times like I was when I set the last two PRs), I beat the shit out of myself doing legs yesterday and have been training hard for hypertrophy in general for over a month now. I woke up this morning *very clearly* fatigued but I still managed to hit a rep, pretty easily, that only 8-9 months ago was  the best rep I had ever done. That is progress. 

**Eternal: A Training Framework that Embraces this Mentality**

I will start this section with a caveat that this will be a very loose idea of how a program that takes this idea to heart could look. Its not polished, its not tested, its just what I have come up with over the last day. I might come back and work with it more later but know that right now it's a *concept*.  But if it inspires you and you try something like it please let me know how it goes, I would love to hear about it. I think you could reasonably run this kind of training structure under any conditions and indefinitely (until you get bored of it or desire some more technical and focused training for specific goals anyways), hence the name. 

The Basic Structure:

-4-6 Days/wk

-2 Days PR Chasing Movements, 2 Days Anchor Movements, 0-2 Days Accessory Hypertrophy work


PR Chasing Movement Days:

Pick 2 movements (probably one upper body and one lower body movement, but you do you) that you will be focusing on to set a PR every week. These should be movements you are reasonably familiar with but have not trained hard recently. Your main set of these day will be the PR Chase set. This should start with a Rep/Weight scheme that is challenging but not maximal effort. Every week you will perform this same movement with the goal of setting a PR by either adding weight or reps. You should not try to blow your previous weeks set out of the water, add only 5-10lbs (or even less if it is a light movement) or 1-2 reps. You will stall eventually, the more solid weeks of progress you can get before that though the better. Before or after this PR set perform build up sets or back off sets, your preference. This should be 2-4 sets and should be relatively easy compared to the PR chase set. Drop weight and or reps compared to the PR chase set. I have not thought about this enough to give firm numbers so use your best judgement. If doing build up sets be sure to give enough rest before the PR chase set that you can give it a good effort. These sets are to be followed by your choice of accessory work. Ill give some rough ideas below. 

When you fail to set a PR you have the option of giving it one more week if you think there is a good reason you failed (life got in the way, minor injury, ect), or moving the movement to the Anchoring days and choosing a new PR chase movement. If you picked an upper and a lower like I suggested choose the same type of movement to replace this one. 

Anchor Movement Days: 

When starting the program you can just pick an upper and a lower (or whatever, again, you do you) movement that you have trained hard recently as you will not have any failed PR Chasing movements to use. On the anchor movement days we will focus on reinforcing the lift you just had a chain of PRs on. You will perform 3-4 sets with this movement, using a weight/reps that is just a bit easier than the PR, enough that preforming it 3-4 times with a good amount of rest is hard but doable. E.g. drop a 5RM to 3x3 or drop the weight by a bit less than 10% and perform 3x5. Again, use your best judgement on these sets and adjust accordingly to get 3-4 hard, but doable working sets. When a PR chase movement gets moved to the anchor movement day the old anchor movement gets dropped from the program. 

Again chose accessory work after these sets based on your preference. 

Accessory Hypertrophy Days:

These days are optional and you should pick a number of days according to your goals, recovery potential and time. For example, you should probably include one or both if bulking, but remove them when cutting. Likewise if you have a busy schedule you can probably ignore them, or if you know your recovery is shitty at the moment. I won't tell you exactly how to train these days but I think an upper focused day and a lower would make sense, though other splits could also be acceptable depending on your goals and how you are laying out your accessories on other days. 

Examples of Accessory splits:

-U/Lx2 on the PR/Anchor days, full body (or preferential focus) or U/L on the dedicated accessory day(s)

-PPLx2 Spread across the six days, with your two favorite/most focused days on the dedicated accessory days 

-Chest, Back, Arms, Shoulders/Legs 

-You get the idea. 

On the PR/Anchor days I would suggest keeping your accessory worked reigned in, with quality over quantity. 3 sets each of three movements with near max effort on the first two and maximal effort (potentially with intensity modifiers) on the last for example. You can treat work for small muscles or muscles that usually take high volume work (like abs, calves, side/rear delts, ect) as extras on top of this if you have time. 

For the dedicated accessory hypertrophy days feel free to indulge. 

In general I think you can take some leeway with your split choices in regards to the PR chase and Anchor movements. For example it it not the end of the work to work chest accessories the day before or after a PR chase day with a bench variant. This might be the only way to make a split fit your days working and it will not kill you to do so. 


**Conclusion**: 

I don't have much more to say. This is a mindset that I have been steadily embracing more and more and I think it has a lot to offer to many lifters who are starting to run into those longer plateaus around there focused lifts as they move past the beginner stages into more advanced territory. I wish I had had the realizations I have now had earlier, as it would have saved me some time and made some years of my training more productive. I'm sure I will read this over later today after I have let it sit out of mind for a while and make some small changes to improve how it reads but in the mean time feel free to ask for clarification or elaboration."

Neutral,Gym Story Saturday  Hi! Welcome to your weekly thread where you can share your gym tales!
Disordered,"M/28/6'0"" 170 - 185lbs. Two Years of Progress.  Hello /r/fitness. 

I just wanted to share my progress over the past two years. 

First up progress pic: [April of 2019 to July 2021](https://i.imgur.com/2OPpRvH.png)

Currently I am M/28/6'0""/184lbs. When I started this journey back in 2019 I was a super skinny fat 170lbs. 

I had always been the super skinny weak kid growing up. [Me at 24 vs 28](https://i.imgur.com/L0hKsjL.png) 

Early on in my training I think I maxed out my bench at around 95-100lbs. I had literally no strength or sports background, so it was literally starting from square one. 

My goal in posting this, is to maybe give some people hope that don't have a background in sports or strength training at all. I fucked up many times in this process, but everything was a learning experience and I feel like I am constantly getting better. It just takes time. 

Below are my lift progressions, all in pounds.

&nbsp;

| Lift       | Before      | After       |
|:-----------|:------------|:------------|
| Bench      |          95|     275
| Squat  |    215|  [405](https://streamable.com/1eyay8) 
| Deadlift      |        225|   465


Unfortunately I don't have video of the other two from my mock powerlifting meet earlier this year.
&nbsp;

**So, what all did I do?**

Well the first I went to therapy for my depression in 2019. My therapist required me to hit the gym, and be active. I work as a software developer and love playing video games and whatnot, so my activity level was basically zero. I would eat like garbage and drink tons of soda. 

I started going to the gym and was running *Shortcut to Shred* by Jim Stoppani at the recommendation of a friend. I kind of had fuck-around-itis the entire time, never kept track of weights. But the important thing was I started building the habit. The gym I was going to didn't really have a decent barbell setup, so eventually I switched gyms and programs. I hadn't made a ton of progress at that time. 

I had no idea what I was doing with my diet, and while I made decent strength gains at the time, I didn't really make any visible aesthetic progress.

That's when I found out powerlifting existed and I fell in love with it/switched to a large gym with lots of oly lifting platforms. All I wanted to do was progress on the big 3, and progress I did. My lifts shot up(comparative to where I was) and I was finally able to get a 135lbs bench. It was a HUGE milestone for me. 

I trained exclusively with powerlifting programs for a while, got into the 1000lbs club and hit the milestones I wanted to. I got lucky and built a homegym literally 3 months before the pandemic hit, so I was set for that.

Most of my lifting was done in 3-5 rep range, and I was benching squatting and deadlifting 2-3x per week. Very little accessories.

But around the start of 2021 I realized I looked like DYEL. My arms were small, my shoulders much much larger than my biceps. I had too much bodyfat. You couldn't even see my muscles I had spent time building. Yeah I could bench 255-265 at the time, I could squat almost four plates, but it wasn't really visible.

[Look at this beefcake greek god](https://i.imgur.com/oQZbUUK.png)

So I got frustrated and phoned it in for a while. My diet fell off the rails and I just coasted through the little workouts I would do. 

Around 4 months ago I got back on the wagon, dialed in my diet and started slamming actual bodybuilding workouts. 

After years of doing PPL, 5/3/1, Hybrid Powerlifting, GCZL and other programs, I swapped to a fully bro split bodybuilding program. Which Reddit can't stand. But it really got me passionate about lifting again. The pumps were INSANE. 

&nbsp;

I am currently running Gamma Bomb by John Meadows and seeing great progress.
&nbsp;

The split is split up into five days:

Day 1: Back + abs + calves

Day 2: Chest + Shoulders

Day 3: Legs

Day 4: Arms + Abs + Calves

Day 5: This day is a dedicated pump day. In the first 6 weeks it is upper body pump day, and in the second 6 weeks it is a lower body day.

John Meadows loves cluster sets and drop sets, and the program increases in volume every week for 6 weeks until you deload. 

In week 1 you are doing anywhere from 18-25 sets in a workout, by week 6 the hardest week has up to 38 sets. It is BRUTAL, but if you love training to failure and a bro split, I cannot recommend the program enough. The other thing with Meadow's programs, they are never the same week to week. He keeps things really fresh and mixes up the exercises every week. This can be a little hard to gauge progress on sometimes, but since you are using Reps in Reserve and training to failure often, it is a plus for me. 

&nbsp;

 I am on a slight bulk of about 250 calories, currently eating around 2900 per day. I don't track my macros, but I religiously tracked for about a year, so I have decent expectations of portion sizes. 

A day of eating currently looks like:

Greek Yogurt + 4 eggs and some vegetables for breakfast.

Protein Shake.

Lunch - 40-60g of protein in a lean meat(usually chicken), along side a carb like rice or potatoes + some onions and peppers.

I eat a meal preworkout, usually a banana alongside my preworkout supplement for energy.

Another protein shake

And then for dinner I eat BIG. Me and my wife cook dinner together every night. It is usually fajitas, shrimp pasta, steaks, or anything else protein heavy and filling.

I have completely cut out soda, and milk(I used to drink 4-5 glasses a day), and I feel myself getting leaner and more vascular all the time. 

As far as how I got to my current macros, It has just been a lot of fine tuning over the past year. I would watch the scale religiously and adjust up or down, all while making sure I got enough protein. I try to eat 1.2g per lbs of bodyweight at all costs.

&nbsp;

The other big thing was I got my T checked around the start of this year. I went to an endo out of curiosity, and I ended up having sub 300 T levels. This is REALLY REALLY low, which my endo says explains my size/weight before and my depression and other symptoms I was having. I got on a mild T booster and got myself back up to a healthy level with my doctors help, and it has been a game changer as far as energy and mental health goes. 

What's next? I'm going to keep grinding and focus on aesthetics and bodybuilding. I hit a 4 plate squat, I am over caring about the numbers I put up. I just want to feel good and look good, and get over this body dysmorphia. 

I feel like my arms/chest/calves REALLY need some growth, so I will focus on that on the caloric surplus, and then probably try to cut down 10-15lbs.

I'll finish it off with a few more progress pics

# Athletic history:

I had done sports pretty much my entire life, most notably fencing 4 days/12 hours per week from 2016-March 2018. I quit fencing and didn't do anything until November 2018 when I started messing around at my school gym.

# Training

I started going to the gym consistently at the start of 2019, though I didn't have a program. The starting lifting numbers are slightly inaccurate because I didn't max out lifts such as squats until much later. I remember failing a 115lbs bench very early in my training, and the 255lbs squat didn't come until around April or May of that year. My lifts at the end of this period were: 75kg/165 bench and 115/255 squat. I weighed 70kg/155 lbs.

At the start of summer, I switched to [reddit PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) and made great gains. After 2 months, bench shot up to around 88kg/195 lbs and I gained some experience deadlifting. I weighed 72kg/155lbs. Because I was starting a new school year, I switched to [nSuns](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/nsuns-lp/) and really started going hard (2hrs+ sessions). During Late October, I maxed out again and hit a 95kg/210 lbs bench, 129/285 squat, and the heaviest I ever deadlifted was 137kg/300 lbs for 6.

After watching a [weightlifting video that got on my youtube recommended](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nfA8rAfHSI), I fell into the rabbit hole, watching [Clarence](https://www.youtube.com/user/clarence0), [Ashgabat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoj4DsAwJwg), and all types of weightlifting content. I decided to switch to weightlifting in November.

My weightlifting training has been pretty inconsistent: November 2019-February 2020, August 2020-October 2020, March 2021-today for a total of 12 out of 21 months. I also only train 3 days a week (my coach runs his gym as a passion project, so it's only open 3days/wk) which is significantly lower than nSuns or PPL. My weight also fluctuated a lot. I weighed 75kg/165lbs right before quarantine but dropped all the way to 70kg/155lbs by August 2020. I made it up to around 76/168 lbs in October but managed to keep my weight despite not training and I've been pretty stable at 82kg/180 lbs for a few months now.

Regardless of inconsistent training and weight, I made great squat PRs, hitting 145kg/321lbs in December 2019, 127kg/280 x 5 in October 2020, 143kg/315lbs x 5 in May 2021, and 162kg/357lbs for my first double bodyweight squat in June 2021. I had and have injuries in my wrist, so I've been unable to train the snatch for about 2 months, and I recently injured my shoulder so I wasn't able to do anything overhead for around 3 weeks.

I haven't benched for almost a year now and I haven't deadlifted anything above 130kg/286 lbs because I can only clean 118kg/260lbs.

# Diet

I don't have a very precise diet. I make sure to limit sugar heavily (only milk and water for the past 3-4 years, no candy, no ice cream, no sweet snacks like cookies/brownies) and roughly hit my calories/protein. However, more often than not I end up not eating enough. I usually eat 2 meals a day, sometimes only 1 because my sleep schedule is terrible. In college I hope to bulk up a lot because I'll have a much better diet.

For supplements, I never took anything until the start of July of this year, when I started taking creatine and vitamin D. I started drinking protein shakes but that's not really a supplement(?).

# Physique

Physique was never really one of my main goals but of course it's a nice bonus. Sucks that I couldn't get pictures of my legs before working out, but they were still pretty big regardless because of all the fencing (and soccer/track as well). I just wanted an opinion, do I really look like I'm 180 lbs? I always look at other people and think to myself like damn they're huge!, only for them to weigh less than me.

Some of my biggest inspirations are [apti aukadov](https://imgur.com/a/rDvicTd), [toshiki yamamoto](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k2zSsPxVCMs/maxresdefault.jpg), and [tian tao](https://www.thehandbook.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,height=300,fit=cover,q=85/https://files.thehandbook.com/uploads/2020/03/44378283-335510077244129-2228533361662492672-n.jpg)... Absolutely monstrous quads and a ripped, aesthetic upper body is a killer combination

# What's next?

I'm going to continue weightlifting for probably the rest of my life. I hope to squat 270kg and have a weightlifting total over 300kg one day. My current goal is a 200 kg squat by the time I'm 19 (next february) and to qualify for usaw junior nationals next year. In college I might do some bodybuilding and accessory training that I've been neglecting, and maybe even bench a little. I plan to bulk to 89kg and maybe far in the future 96kg (based on weight classes).

Thanks for reading, and thank you to my coach, teammates, reddit for their resources, and various youtube channels. If you're still reading thank you as well!"
Disordered,"Muscular endurance & strength when training to failure  Hi everyone,  


It has been a couple of months that have been on a successful bodyweight training program (unfortunately it is impractical for me to go at the gym atm). However, as I wanted to experience different ways of training, I tried working out to failure on a couple of exercises and I noticed some weird pattern.

Just to give some numbers: on push-ups specifically, I tried to go for technical failure and I reached 31 push ups in a row before my arms would push me mid-way and would not be able to produce enough force anymore. I did the same thing on Squats & lunges with a 24kg (52 lbs) kettle bell and reached 26 for squats and 33 for lunges.

Here are the things I have noticed, and I wonder if ppl experienced the same:

1. When training to failure even taking 3-5 mn rest I would never be able to reproduce the same performance on the next set. I typically aim at 3 identical sets on each exercise, and when training to failure my performance would just massively degrade no matter what (I can easily lose 5-10 reps ). Most things I have read on the topic seem to assume that you chose a number of rep to failure and them you perform the 3 identical sets, but I find it absolutely impossible.
2. I really find the fatigue of working to failure to be out of proportion with the volume. For example I can perform 10 sets of 10 push ups with 1-1:30 mn of rest between sets for a total of 100 push ups and do that every other day with no problem. However doing even 3 sets of 25 push ups seem to greatly compromise my next performance and I often need more than one day of rest to recover.
3. Now, the funny thing is that, this pattern seems mostly to apply when I train for muscular endurance, by which in mean sets of 12+ reps. When it comes to pull-ups and dips where my sets are still under the 10 reps, I can train to failure without suffering from disproportionate fatigue. I was objectively getting stronger and being able to add a few reps/weight from week to week.

Have you noticed a similar pattern where training to failure for your muscular endurance seems to fatigue you disproportionately compared to training to failure for pure strength (heavier weight and low reps sets) ? I have read some scientific literature suggesting that training to failure was not necessarily the best (especially if you want some volume for hypertrophy), but I cannot remember seeing this muscular endurance/strength divide when it comes to the fatigue failure produces."

Disordered,"6 months on PPL & moderate calorie deficit  [Side-by-side before and after pics](https://imgur.com/Uk6m5B0)

I am 27 years old and 6'4""

I bulked from [194](https://imgur.com/a/SLbtzhu) (skinny fat, regularly lifted for about a year) to [225](https://imgur.com/a/votJHjP) (fat) in 9 months. I was eating pretty “clean”, but just a lot of food. I sporadically tracked my calorie intake and I was eating close to 4,000 calories a day with 300g+ protein. I was gaining about 1-2lbs a week towards the end of the bulk. My training program was 7 days a week weight training (split: back and bicep, chest and tricep, legs, shoulders). Also, every other day 30-40 minutes MISS cardio (10 mile stationary bike, hill training mode). I was not logging my workouts but I was getting stronger and bigger (mostly fat). I decided to get serious with my diet and exercise routine and that’s when I noticed rapid progress. 

I began a cut and my goal was to get to sub-10% bodyfat in 4-6 months for beach vacations this summer. I used [this video]( https://youtu.be/yTiOH6ecktE) by Jeremy Ethier to as a guide for how to plan my diet. I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytN366VCGls) by Jeff Nippard as a guideline for how to eat. For the entire diet I was eating 220g+ protein and 20-30% calories from fat, the rest was carbs. I shot for 1-2lb fat loss per week and when I reached a plateau I either 1: Reduced my daily calorie intake by 50-100, usually from carbs. OR 2: Increased my daily activity level by adding a small amount of LISS cardio. I weighed and  cooked 95% of my food, and logged 100% of my food in MyFitnessPal. I weighed myself every morning and tracked my average weekly weight to see through daily fluctuations. I also stopped drinking alcohol completely during this cut. 

I began a 6 day PPL routine and began logging my workouts to track my progress and ensure I was progressively overloading my lifts. I designed my own programs that looked like [this](https://imgur.com/Z5JEoAh) and took deload weeks every 8-12 weeks and switched up the exercises afterwards. I was doing tons of volume in my routine, 20 sets per body part per week minimum. I would do 6-8 exercises per session and do the compounds first, doing 4 sets in the 8-10 rep range. Isolations came next with 3 sets in the 10-15 rep range. I would progressively overload by adding 1 or 2 reps each session until I reached the rep range ceiling. Then, up the weight and start at the bottom of the rep range. For example, a bench press one session would go Set 1: 185 x 10, Set 2: 185 x 10, Set 3: 185 x 9, Set 4: 185 x 9. The next session I would try for 4 sets of 10 with 185. After hitting that, I would increase the weight to 190 and try for 4 sets of 8. Rinse and repeat. I pushed myself and went close to failure on every set (8+ RPE), with ample rest between sets (3 minutes for compound, 2 minutes for isolation). I kept a timer going for the entire session to ensure the proper rest time and to make sure I was having enough time under tension. I aimed for at least 30 seconds TUT, but ideally 40 seconds per set. Because of this, my weight training takes about 1h 30m per day. I averaged about 50 minutes of LISS cardio every day (walking outside or incline treadmill) and began stretching 30-45 mins per day. I was also getting adequate rest, 7+ hours most nights. 

I got down to 181lbs carb depleted. 2 days later carb loaded I was 190lb and [this is me peaking with a pump](https://imgur.com/SbXwHCR). 3 weeks prior I was 10.7% body fat according to a DEXA scan, so I would estimate I am somewhere around 9% at my peak. 

I did not miss a single workout. I went on a couple diet breaks (1 full week about 4 months in and 1 weekend 5 months in). Other than that, I stuck to my diet and didn’t cheat. I had meals that were “dirty”, but I fit them in my macros. I used Greg Doucette’s cookbook for a lot of my meals. I learned from Jeff Nippard, Greg Doucette, Jeremy Ethier, Renaissance Periodization and a few others on YouTube how to diet, train, and supplement.  

All my lifts increased. I am dealing with a herniated disk and AC joint sprain, so I had to work around the big 3 (squat, deadlift, flat bench). But for reference I was able to go from 140lb to 270lb hack squat (for reps of 10) and on bench press I went from 185lb 4RM to 225lb in 4 months before my shoulder prevented me from going further. I have been adding 10lb per month on my incline DB bench since starting, going from 60lb to 85lb in 3 months. My waist is 4 inches smaller at the same body weight as a year ago.

If I could go back and change anything I would not have bulked up so heavy. I was chasing the number on the scale and wanted to get big. I didn’t use the mirror like I should have to gauge progress. A “dirty bulk” or “dreamers bulk” is not the way to go. It took me 6 MONTHS of strict dieting to strip away that fat. I probably lost a good amount of muscle in the process. Bulk up slow. Do body recomposition, or “gain-taining” if you are only 10-20lbs overweight. Find quality, evidence based sources of information online, like the YouTube channels I mentioned. Some things you just need to learn for yourself, but there’s a lot of advice that’s worth hearing.

Edit: for further context, [this](https://imgur.com/LVKNIY2) is where I was at 2 years ago at 170lb when I basically began attempting to lift regularly. My diet changed constantly and I was spinning my wheels up to the 194lb image above."

Neutral,Gym Story Saturday  Hi! Welcome to your weekly thread where you can share your gym tales!
Neutral,"Balancing progressive overload and joint + connective tissue health: Giving my joints a break for 2 weeks  Soooo I've recently restarted going to the gym after an extended rest period of about 4 years lol. I had to stop cause of wrist issues (wrist tendonitis + instability), even though that original period of weightlifting only lasted 3-4 months back when I was 17/18.

But it's been less than 2 months, and my joint issues are back - this time, with my shoulder, elbow and left knee joining the list of joints who protest me going to the gym. This is very aggravating, because I've been using quite low weights (upwards of 15/20 reps to reach anything even approaching close to failure) for generally 3 sets. I am also fairly certain that my form is good.

None of my joints **hurt** but they feel the strain, and I know that if I keep going, I'm just gonna make it worse.

So, much to my chagrin, I'm gonna take a 2 week break - no gym, no bodyweight exercise, trying to limit stress on joints from keyboard typing. Hopefully this'll help.

Then I'll start from scratch, on very low weight, as I did at the start of June, and work myself up again.

Which kinda raises the question which this entire point was leading up to:

If tendons + joints require such a loooong time to adjust to higher loads being placed on them, compared to muscles, which adjust quite quickly, how do you carry out progressive overload safely? In particular for beginner lifters, who's loads are going to increase enormously in a relatively short period of time.

Any advice/insight would be welcome!

EDIT: My program is :

Workout 1:

* Squat 10kgs
* Dumbbell Bench press (3 -> 4 -> 5kg in each hand)
* Lat pulldown: 18 -> 32kg
* Calf raise on machine:
* Dumbbell curl (where I supinate my wrist through the movement): 3 -> 4 -> 5kg in each hand

Workout 2:

* Deadlift: 20 Kg
* Standing dumbbell Shoulder Press ( 3 -> 4kg in each hand)
* Chest-supported T-Bar row: 18 Kg
* Leg extension: 
* Cable fly: 5.7kg in each hand
* Crunch (or another ab exercise)
* Tricep extension on cable (or another tricep exercise): 18kg

Workout 3:

* Dumbbell lunge: 7kg
* Dumbbell incline press: 3kg -> 4kg
* Reverse grip lat pulldown: 32kg
* Barbell hip thrust: 40kg
* Face Pull: 14kg
* Dumbbell lateral raise: 2kg -> 3kg

Generally I do 2 workouts a week on average. I started off at very light weight for all these movements (generally above 15 reps to even get close to failure). As I was tightening up my form and got more confident, I raised my weight, except for exercises which I viewed as risky, such as dumbbell presses, dumbbell shoulder presses (pretty much all exercises which fucked with my wrist in the past).

Neutral,"Weight lifting / Gripping aid device advice for a deformed hand  Hi All,

I have searched google high and low for an answer to this question so I hope you lovely people can help. I have recently gotten back into exercising and specifically weight lifting and want to finally fix a problem that has plagued me all my life. Basically i was born with most of my right hand missing, google crab hand on google images and the literal first image is basically my right hand. 

The crux of the issue is that my hand ended up smaller than my wrist (I go into more detail below). But in essence any time I pull anything of weight the adaptive aid I use now goes  flying. 

&#x200B;

This has meant I have had very limited gripping strength and no palm to speak of which makes gripping exercises incredibly hard e.g. anything with a lat machine. I have an aid from the company Active Hands which works decently for any pushing exercises (although due to the small wrist size i cant do barbells without causing a decent amount of pain. This is due to all the weight on a tiny wrist area) ,however as my wrist is larger than my hand and gets sweaty mid workout, anytime I attach weight to the aid and pull it invariably ends up flying away from my hand, sometime with hilarious consequences (literally went flying across the gym yesterday when I again attempted the lat machine).

As such any advice, recommendations for alternative products or alternative back exercises you all could recommend to get over obstacle I would very very much appreciate.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Deformed hand smaller than wrist, can't grip naturally and aid goes flying off hand when I pull. Need alternate option for doing any pulling e.g. back, tricep, etc... exercises.

The past year I've been focusing on loosing weight training with a personal trainer and doing mainly calisthenics, but now the cost of training for IPSC really took the budget I got and, because I'm not really a fit kind of person I was looking for something I could do at home. Do some of you train specifically for practical shooting? Do you have routines or something I can follow online, like videos or something? 
Basically a match consists (obviously) of shooting, so using a minimal grip strength, then there's a lot of sprinting, squatting while shooting in awkward positions, and sometimes ducking and moving through tunnels. So mainly is a lot of cardio work, the match are a some of stages that doesn't last more than 30/40 seconds at worst. 
The idea is to get faster and develop a good coordination in explosive movements. I don't really need to get a ton of muscles to manage recoil, contrary to what most people think, I just need to be more athletic. 
Sorry if is a dumb question but I really don't know much about, and tbh I just don't want to waste time and energy in some routine not useful or to get hurt with dumb exercises found randomly online. Any suggestions are welcomed!
P.s.: sorry for mistakes if there are, English is not my first language and thank anyone in advance!"

Disordered,"Request for picking DB only routine: Frankoman's vs Fierce 5 vs DB Stopgap vs DB Stopgap PPL  **Does anyone know much about these recommended DB-only programs and can give a quick overview of potential pitfalls between each one? Goals: fat loss. Also, how to assess if you're a beginner? I'm unsure if I should be looking at beginner only routines. Thanks in advance!**

**Concerns:**

\- Is 3 day total body workouts enough albeit seems recommended for true beginners? I can't tell if I'm a beginner since I have lifting experience and I run daily (lol). I haven't been on a regular lifting regimen in over a year but I do circuit style lifting and some interval runs with sprints mixed In.

\- Programs not adjusted for fat loss. I want to build muscle, but I need to lose fat first or else I'll be having muscle underneath the layer of fat.

\- Too much rest time in between working the same muscle group. Ie,  some PPL programs work the legs/glutes with 4 days of rest days in between, which seems to be a waste since 48 hours is deemed as optimal.

\- There is much more emphasis on upper body than lower

[**Fierce 5 Dumbbell Program**](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?p=1266579671#post1266579671) **- 3 day rotating split ( A / B / A ---> B / A / B )**

This program is what I'm most likely going to do. However, he said that this program isn't ideal for fat loss. I'm confused as to why and how to modify it?

    **Workout A**
    Split Squat 3x8 (each leg)
    Bench 3x8 (If you don’t have a bench do floor press)
    DB Rows 3x8 (One arm on bench, back parallel to floor)
    Reverse Flies 3x10
    Calf raises 2x15/French Press 2x10 Superset
    
    **Workout B**
    Walking Lunge 3x8 (each leg)
    Overhead Press 3x8
    Romanian Deadlift or Straight Leg Deadlift 3x8 (Use single leg version when you max out your weight)
    Lat Pulldowns or Pull/Chin ups (Once you reach 3x8 begin adding weight)
    Ab work 2x15/Curls 2x10 Superset (I don’t care what ab work you do)

[**DB Stopgap PPL**](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2e79y4/dumbbell_ppl_proposed_alternative_to_dumbbell/) **- 6 day ( P/P/L/P/P/L/R ) or 3 day ( P/P/L/R )**

PPL version is a potential 2nd choice due to the different exercises. However, I'm not too sure about PPL split and back-to-back Push + Pull seems hard on the upper body. It does seem to be upper body heavy and not enough glute... and legs are worked out with 3 days of rest in between rather than 48 hours.

    **Push**
    - Chest Press
    - Incline Fly
    - Arnold Press
    - Overhead Tricep Extension
    
    **Pull**

Disordered,"5 Cardio Myths and Misconceptions that Need to Stop Being Spewed.   [Reading the cardio thread that was recently posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/oftc49/calories_burned_vs_effort/), I noticed a bunch of myths and misconceptions related to cardio being continually regurgitated and upvoted. It was a painful read. So I decided to make this thread to dispel them.  And yes, I checked the Wiki and didn’t see any of these myths or misconceptions mentioned. And if they were, they must have been buried somewhere and read by no one given how frequently they were spewed and upvoted in the linked thread above. 

It’s a long read, so here’s a table of contents of the 5 myths and misconceptions (all of which were parroted and upvoted multiple times in the linked thread) that I will be addressing for those who don’t want to read through the whole thing:

1) HIIT burns more calories than steady state.

2) But muh efficiency!!!!

3) X cardio is better than Y cardio for fat loss!!!

4) Lifting weights burn more calories than cardio because it raises your metabolism!

5) You can’t outrun a bad diet. 

&#x200B;

**1) HIIT burns more calories than steady state.**

No, HIIT does not burn more calories than steady state cardio when done for the same amount of time, in fact, it’s the opposite, for the simple reason that in any given time you can cover a greater distance properly pacing yourself (ie. running at a steady state) than doing it HIIT style.  

“But I read a study”... You can easily make your own study with a sample size of 1:

Go to the gym, hop on a treadmill or a stationary bike, and go at a decent steady state pace for 30 minutes (and by decent pace, I mean actually try). How much distance did you cover? How many calories did the machine say you burned? 

Now, on another day, hop on the same piece of equipment and do the same 30 mins but HIIT style... How much distance did you cover? If you didn’t go at a bitch pace during your SS session, answer will be: much less. How many calories did the machine say you burned... Once again, the answer will be: much less. I’m not saying that the calorie counters on machines are completely accurate (they’re not), but if the machine says you burned 300 calories more on one day than another, then you probably burned more calories on that day than the other, perhaps not 300 more, but you probably burned more calories regardless. 

As mentioned, steady state cardio is more effective than HIIT for burning calories for the simple reason that you can cover MUCH more distance doing an exercise at a steady state than you can doing that same exercise HIIT style. If the opposite were the case, you would see all those 10+km runners at the Olympics sprinting/walking, sprinting/walking etc... They don’t do it, because that would be stupid. And no, it doesn’t matter that you “felt more tired” after doing 1.5K of interval sprints in 30 minutes than you did after a 5K jog in 30 minutes. At the end of the day, you covered more distance during the 5K jog in the same amount of time, and thus, you did more work and burned more calories. This is basic thermodynamics, and whatever study you find that says otherwise is flawed.

And no... EPOC (ie. the AFTERBURN!!111) from HIIT is negligible. You are not burning double the calories lying in bed browsing Reddit after your HIIT workout. Let’s not go there. 

&#x200B;

**2) BUT MUH EFFICIENCY!!!!**

Probably the most aggravating of the cardio myths and misconceptions, it’s not that it’s completely untrue, but the conclusions that people derive from it are not only wrong, but detrimental in the sense that it discourages people from doing cardio in fear of becoming “too efficient at it.” Do you really think that you can burn more calories than Lance Armstrong on a 2 hour bike ride because he’s “adapted to it” and you’re “inefficient”? Even though he can cover 20x the distance? But muh inefficiency!!!! 

There is a lot of debate about how efficient you can get depending on the exercise, but at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter. It just means that you can cover the same distance with fewer calories and a lower RPE. So what can you do to get around this? You can simply increase your RPE back to where it was before. So your RPE and calories burned stay the same, but you cover more distance. HOORAY... You’re getting BETTER!

But even if you can get more efficient at an exercise, the vast majority of your progress is still going to come from physiological adaptation. What does this mean? It means that you can go faster, for longer, BURN MORE CALORIES and do all this with a lower RPE. It means that your 30mins/300 calorie run where you were dying at the end turns into a 30mins/500 calorie run where you barely broke a sweat. It means that waking up sore the next day turns into waking up and not feeling a thing even though you covered more distance in less time. 

Tour de France bike riders must be pretty damn efficient at bike riding considering they’re the elite of the elite... They’re so efficient that they must burn like 100 calories during a single ride amirite? Regardless of how efficient they are, they still consume [8,000 calories a day](https://www.outsideonline.com/2100086/day-food-tour-de-france) on average. Do you really think that they’d burn more calories on the stair stepper because they’re less efficient at it? Does that even make sense?

Now for a more scientific answer... Specializing in a specific type of cardio will increase the amount of [myoglobin and mitochondria in the muscles used in that exercise](https://www.issaonline.com/blog/index.cfm/2018/mitochondrial-adaptations-to-aerobic-training#:~:text=The%20overall%20density%20of%20mitochondria,in%20myoglobin%20in%20muscle%20tissue.). The jist of it is myoglobin stores oxygen in the muscles and sends it to the mitochondria in those same muscles which use that oxygen to produce energy (ie burn calories). The more of both you have in your muscles (and the bigger your mitochondria) , the more energy those muscles can produce and the more calories they can burn. 

Changing over to another cardio exercise that you’re less efficient at will mean that you will be using new muscles that are untrained, which will have fewer myoglobin and mitochondria, and thus will not be able to produce as much energy (ie. burn as many calories) as those muscles you use in the exercise that you’re “efficient” at. The end result isn’t that you’d be burning more calories.... Unless it’s a sprint, you’d be burning FEWER calories while getting MORE tired in the process. 

This is not to say that cardio exercises don’t transfer over from one to the other... They do. Cardio increases your heart’s ability to pump blood regardless of the exercise. So a trained cyclist will be better at running than someone who is untrained thanks to the higher cardiac output they’ve attained from cycling. They just won’t be as good at running as they are at cycling due to the aerobic capacity of the muscles not being as trained for that specific exercise. But no, this doesn’t mean they will burn more calories from running because they’re “not efficient at it.” In fact, it means the opposite. 

&#x200B;

**3) X cardio is better than Y cardio for fat loss.**

Calories in, calories out. It doesn’t matter which one burns more fat, it matters which one burns more CALORIES!!! 

To demonstrate this lets take an overly simplistic example... 

Exercise A burns 100% glycogen, 0% fat. 

Exercise B burns 0% glycogen, 100% fat. 

You eat after exercise A at maintenance.... Your glycogen stores are depleted. All the carbs you eat go towards replenishing your glycogen stores with none of it being stored as fat. 

You eat after exercise B at maintenance.... Your glycogen stores are full (since no glycogen was used during your workout). None of the carbs you eat go towards replenishing your glycogen stores since they’re already full. So what will your body do with those carbs? It will turn them all into fat. So after you’ve eaten the net effect between exercise A and exercise B when it comes to fat loss... Is zero. 

So whether a workout burns more glycogen or more fat, if your goal is fat loss, it doesn’t matter. If you want to lose fat, you need a calorie deficit, and to that end, the more effective cardio workout will be the one that burns more CALORIES. 

“But I’ll just do a bunch of cardio and not eat carbs... Problem solved”!!!! <--- Don’t do that, your body needs glycogen. You will feel like shit and your cardio gains will suffer, and cardio gains = burn more calories.  

&#x200B;

**4) Lifting weights burn more calories than cardio because it raises your metabolism.**

While lifting weights does raise your metabolism... [One pound of muscle burns 6 to 7 calories a day.](https://www.verywellfit.com/how-many-calories-does-muscle-really-burn-1231074) Sure, those calories can add up if you put on some serious muscle. But the amount of calories burned from muscle is still overstated. If you want to find a counter source that says this isn’t true, and that a pound of muscle burns 100 calories a minute... I don’t care, since I’m about to put the cardio vs. weight lifting for calorie burning debate to rest either way... 

Again...  There's a reason why Tour de France cyclists [consume 8000 calories a day](https://www.outsideonline.com/2100086/day-food-tour-de-france) on average yet are built like twigs. That's over 2500 calories more per day (the TDEE of an entire human) than what [Ronnie fucking Coleman ate in his prime.](https://fitnessvolt.com/ronnie-coleman-diet/)

I’m sorry, but nobody can claim that lifting weights burns more calories than cardio when these 140 pound Tour de France cyclists would view the bulking diets of the world’s top body builders as starvation diets. Yes, you can increase your RMR and TDEE from lifting weights and your body does use calories to repair muscle tissue, but even when taking that into account, when it comes to exercising for weight loss, SS cardio is still king and it’s not even close.  

**5) “You can’t outrun a bad diet.”**

I hate this saying because of how people interpret it... You can’t outrun a bad diet... So don’t run at all because it’s pointless. 

First of all, if you read above you would know by now that there are people who CERTAINLY CAN outrun a bad diet and then some, but that’s because they put in the work. You can’t... because you haven’t. But you can still get better. The more cardio you do, the better you get at it, the more calories you will burn from it, the more you can mitigate the detrimental impacts of a bad diet, the more calories you can consume on a good diet and the lower the impact cheat days will have. 

So if you do have a bad diet... You’d be putting yourself in a much better position at least TRYING to outrun it. And who knows, after you put enough work into it... Maybe you’ll be able to! (Disclaimer... I do promote having a bad diet... Put the fork down fatty! But do cardio too).

**In summary**

SS cardio is great... Should you do it? Absolutely!

But if you don’t want to, that’s fine too. But DON’T use these myths and misconceptions as self-justification for not doing it and certainly DON’T spread these myths and misconceptions to others. All that does is discourage others from bettering themselves and putting in the work that you’re not willing to do.

Neutral,"Calories burned vs effort?  So running on a treadmill for 30 min really makes me exhausted and raises my heart rate and according to the calorie counter, I have burned around 350 calories or something during that time, but it really takes a lot of effort.

If I spend the same amount  of time on an elliptical or on a bike, I will be a lot less tired after 30 min but according to the calorie counter, I would have burned much more calories

I know that you really cant rely on the calories burned counter on cardio equipment like treadmills, ellipticals, rowing machines etc BUT those numbers must be calculated based on something. And its the same with different brands of equipment in other gyms. The exact amount of calories burned will differ a little, but ellipticals and bikes will still burn more calories but with much less effort.

This has really made me curious. Are these numbers completely wrong, or do some forms of cardio burn more calories than other forms even though performing it hardly makes you tired?"

Disordered,"PROGRAM REVIEW: Deep Water Beginner with WAY more work on top  **INTRO**

I remember the last time I ran Deep Water it effectively traumatized me.  I had a cut-off Punisher t-shirt I wore for every squat day on the program that I had to get rid of once it was all over because it was so saturated with fear sweat that it smelled like an open grave and NO amount of washing could get the smell out.  I walked like a toy soldier 6 days a week while I waited for the soreness to go away, I constantly had to field the question of “are you ok?”, my wife frequently found me on the floor in the garage with my head propped up on a furniture dolly to prevent me from drowning in my own sweat, I learned to take an excederin between sets 7 and 8 of the squat workout to chase away the inevitable exertion headache that ALWAYS happened (followed by a Rockstar right after the workout), and I remember “running out of time” on my lunch breaks, just eating as soon as the window opened and stopping when my break was over, HOPING I had put away enough food to recover from my previous workout and be able to train for the next one.  I also remember saying on multiple occasions that it was the most effective program I had run in 21 years, and that’s what I had to remind myself when I decided to take it on again.


And, of course, me being me, I couldn’t just do the same thing twice, so I’m going to start this review talking about all the stuff I did that was DIFFERENT from before, and how that worked out for me.


Without further ado…

**SIGNIFICANT DEVIANCE**


Since I’ve already run this program before, I allowed myself to play around and experiment.  BUT, along with that, my schedule forced me to deviate quite a bit as well.  Specifically, I had 2 one week interruptions within the 6 weeks of the program: one a visit to my in-laws, and one a work trip.  I STILL wanted the program to take around 6 weeks to complete, which meant I took on the task of running the program WITHOUT days off.  I’d run 5 days of week 1, then 5 days of week 2, then 5 days of week 3, etc.  I figured the 14 total days off would give me enough of a break to recover from that.  It shook out that my 1 week break occurred between week 2 and 3, and between week 5 and 6.  During those weeks off, I did a TON of conditioning work, using a weighted vest and a kettlebell while at my in-laws (to include a [100 burpee workout with an 80lb vest](https://youtu.be/fWcw1qbqKjs) and some other terrible WODs) and bodyweight and bands during my work trip (reference my recently posted “Hotel Room Conditioning Insanity” post, which included 2 different 500 burpee workouts among other variants).

On top of that, here are other ways I deviated.

•	I kept up my daily work.  Every day, I did 50 chins, 50 dips, 50 band pull aparts, 40 reverse hypers, 30 GHRs, 25 band pushdowns, 20 standing ab wheels, and 11 neck bridges in 4 different directions.  Exceptions being, if a movement was featured in a Deep Water workout, I wouldn’t do it as part of the daily work.

•	I continued doing conditioning daily, and frequently multiple times a day.  I rotated through a variety of Crossfit style WODs, to include Grace, Fran, Legion of Doom, Black and Blue, 30 thrusters for time w/135lbs, and just other nasty things with barbells, kettlebells, and burpees.  I’d include some running and weighted vest walks as well.  For the ACTUAL conditioning day of Deep Water, I’d do the Juarez Valley front squat workout.  I actually found that I recovered FASTER by forcing myself to do a lot of conditioning with an emphasis on squatting.


•	On that note, for the “technique work” on the Deep Water days, I took to including those 30 total reps into a WOD, done later in the day.  For squats, I was a fan of doing 10-5-15 of squats at 275, chins and dips, and then for deadlifts I’d do 12-9-6-3 of deadlifts, chins and dips, always trying to beat time.  It was a good way to kill 2 birds with one stone: get in the reps, practice technique, and get in conditioning.


•	I added significant work to the back day.  I did all the prescribed work, but also added a high rep set of axle shrugs against bands (starting at 75 and working up to 100 total reps), a set of kroc rows, and 50 band pull aparts.

•	  On press days, I stuck with my lateral raise dropset and Poundstone curls vs the prescribed sets and reps for lateral raises and curls.  I also tended to include band pull aparts between presses, as they made my shoulder feel better.

•	Instead of hyperextensions and sit ups, I would do a circuit of reverse hypers and standing ab wheel.

•	All presses done with an axle, taken from the floor and pressed away.

•	Benching and close grip was done with an axle: incline was done with dumbbells.

•	Lunges were done with a safety squat bar.

**NUTRITION**


I honestly stuck very close to what Jon prescribed.  Organic whenever possible, high quality nutrition sources.  Still went “Deep Mountain” in that, if I allowed myself variance, it was typically something John Meadows was ok with.  This meant a daily inclusion of some dark chocolate…and honestly that’s about it.  I tried including wild blueberries in my diet, but they were wrecking my guts, so I dropped them.  And honestly, I was eating so much food through this process I lost my appetite for “treats”.  In 2019, I was eating 4 quest bars a day, and now I was at the point where I’d eat one every 2-3 days.  I preferred tuna for a quick protein dose.  My wife and I’s favorite local pizza place has a keto crust pizza that is really top notch, but I found myself going for the bone in wings in the program.  I just wanted more food to recover and couldn’t find a reason to eat any junk.  After 12 weeks of BBB Beefcake and Building the Monolith, I think I was just getting burnt out from food and was becoming robotic about it.  That having been said, the program and all the conditioning drove my appetite to even crazier levels, and I was pretty much eating every half hour on shift at work.

**SNAPSHOT: DAY IN THE LIFE**

People seem to find this fascinating, so I’ll write it up.  I’m a shift worker, so this was a day I was coming off night shift, working from 2200-0600.

**RESULTS, OUTCOMES AND EXPERIENCES**

On the final day of the program, I set a front squat rep PR of 225 for 15, done first thing in the morning at 0330, with at least one more rep in the tank.  This was part of my Juarez Valley conditioning protocol, and done AFTER a week off from weights due to work travel.  In turn, this speaks to just how “on” this program got me, because I hit a 500 burpee workout on the day I traveled back from work to home and then got up at 0530 the next day and crushed the week 6 10x10 deadlift workout with 2:00 rests.  Lotta folks talk about feeling weaker after a deload/week off, but every time I go to the well I keep finding more and more.


I wrote about this in the nutrition section, but to repeat: I have been eating so much that I’m just plain sick of it.  The first time I ran the program, I was obeying the idea of “eat a lot of meat and fat”, but wasn’t abiding by “organic”, and I was eating a LOT of saturated (and trans) fats.  This time around, I slashed saturated and got them from quality sources and focused more on monos.  It’s meant eating so much all the time that there’s no room for junk.  In fact, one night, my wife asked me what I wanted for dinner and my answer was legitimately “Nothing”.  THAT was my “cheat meal”.  The first time I ran the program, I’d have a cheat meal each week the night before the lower body workouts, and typically it was Panda Express with a LOT of rice and orange chicken.  This time, I had zero craving for junk, and my “cheat meal” was typically chicken wings and 3 or 4 of my wife’s curly fries at the local restaurant we like.  [I also had a 2lb tomahawk ribeye](https://i.imgur.com/BvwE57w.jpg) to celebrate a few things all at once coming back from my work trip, which I ate off the bone caveman style and found myself STILL looking for more meat when I was done.



And despite all this eating, I put on no appreciable amount of bodyfat.  Again: still not weighing myself, but I have the after photos AND my powerlifting belt, which has STILL not moved a notch from when I started at 177lbs back in Oct.  I’ve had days where I was bloated and it felt snug, and days where it’s fit just right, but I’ve NEVER had a day where it simply wouldn’t latch, whereas typically I’m operating at LEAST one notch out from this point when I’m really chasing bodyweight and eating big.


* [Before](https://i.imgur.com/TKdaF03.jpg)

* [After](https://i.imgur.com/uu7JvtW.jpg)

Once again: aggression and libido took an uptick while on the program.  Finding myself drawn to combat sports yet again, and though options are limited, just the fact I wanna fight again is a sign of all that.


Coming into the program with a solid conditioning base was huge.  I completely blew away my old squatting numbers on the program and never once had to lay down on the floor like I did the first time.  My breathing was able to get back to normal much quicker than before, as was my heart rate.  I’ll keep beating this drum: conditioning matters.  


I did notice my times on the Grace WOD got worse through the program, but I attribute that to how much more fatigue I was carrying compared to the 5/3/1 programs, which checks out.  Jim writes programs for athletes, with the understanding that the weights are just a part of what you’re doing, so it manages fatigue and has room to play as far as conditioning goes.  Deep Water is supposed to be all inclusive, so taking onto it like I did is gonna come with some consequences. 


**IMPRESSIONS ON HOW EVERYTHING HAS FIT TOGETHER**


When I originally came up with the 26 week protocol of BBB Beefcake-Building the Monolith-Deep Water, it was honestly a bit of a “so there!”: just something to throw out and shut someone up if they didn’t know how to eat and train.  But going through it, I’m really pretty pleased with how it all fits together.  BBB Beefcake lays down a GREAT foundation to kick-start the whole time off.  You get to practice a lot of reps and develop some solid conditioning with the time constraints, and you have plenty of opportunities to get in more conditioning.  Meanwhile, the weight is on the lighter side, so you aren’t thrashing your connective tissues or digging too deep into your CNS recovery well (yeah yeah, CNS boogieman: you know what I mean).


BtM comes along and it’s SUPPOSED to be “5/3/1 for Size”, and though it DOES do that, it’s really like an intensification block from BBB Beefcake.  You’re lifting heavier weights for fewer reps and getting in most of your hypertrophy work in the assistance stuff.  The 5s pro in BBB Beefcake meant only hitting heavy work for 1 REAL set, but BtM has you hitting 3-5 sets across: it’s INTENSE.  Meanwhile, widowmakers are building up some high rep squatting ability, and the conditioning element to it is teaching you how to recover from intense work.


Deep Water comes along and kicks you straight in the junk, BUT, all that work from 5/3/1 has you ready for it.  When I first ran Deep Water, I wasn’t really doing anything intense beforehand, coming off of strongman comp preparation vs real accumulation work, and it broke me down HARD.  But coming off BBB Beefcake I was already doing HALF the program on the regular (5x10 vs 10x10), while BtM gave me a bit of a break from that to focus on getting stronger but not so much that I lost my touch for high rep sets, and throughout all that time I had been driving my conditioning so far into the red that I was totally prepared.  I also had a fairly good idea what weight was challenging for me for a set of 10 from BBB Beefcake, so there wasn’t any real need for 1rm testing and minimal guesswork.  This went from just a wild guess to something VERY viable, and may become a regular-ish thing.


**NEXT?**


Deep Water intermediate, with more deviance. Since I still don’t really have a solid grasp of my 1rm, nor any intention to test it, I’m going to pick challenging weights to concur, and then smash myself with conditioning until something breaks. After that, I’m going to take a break from eating so much goddamn food. I’m contemplating some DoggCrapp style training, as I think single hard set work will be an excellent contrast to this super high volume stuff, and the variety of movements will be good to balance so much time spent doing the same thing."

Disordered,Gym Story Saturday  Hi! Welcome to your weekly thread where you can share your gym tales!
Neutral,"Partial vs Full ROM  I’ve noticed that most of the largest, most muscular guys I see at the gyms tend to use a surprisingly small range of motion when they lift. I was under the impression that full ROM is optimal for hypertrophy, but I’m beginning to question that belief. It seems like most of the guys doing partials with heavy weight are much larger than most of the guys doing full ROM with moderate weight.

Are these people starting with full ROM and switching to partials after getting huge, or are they actually building all that muscle with partials?"

Neutral,"Stop Qualifying Your Results  These are all common types of questions/statements I see here and on other subs from beginners:

'Is this a good lift for a 6'/145lb/17yo lifter with mild scoliosis and a peanut allergy?'

'My lift is not very high but I also weigh very little for my height so it's good for my weight' 

'Is this a good lift for a beginner who has been lifting for 178 days and 14 hours?'

'But i'm the strong compared to random people off the street'

You get the idea. 

Some beginners seem to be very fixated on qualifying their accomplishments. Instead of just getting stronger, they want to change the context of their results to make them appear better. Links to sites like symmetricstrength are presented all the time by and in response to beginners talking about ""How good is X lift of mine"". People ask for levels that are good for someone who has only been lifting a year, or who is 140lbs at 5'11'' or whatever. 

This doesn't make you strong. Dressing up your 250lb deadlift, when you have the potential for 500lb+, in any number of ""Well it's strong for _______"" does not change the fact that you have a 250lb deadlift when you can achieve a 500lb deadlift with more time, more effort, and better training. And yes, there is probably a subset of people that share some characteristics with you for which a 250lb deadlift IS strong, for which 250lbs is nearing what they can potentially do. But they know that already, they aren't asking if 250 is strong. 

Strong people are not looking to qualify or validate their accomplishments to make them look good. They know how much work they put in to get there and know that they are strong. Everyone else needs to stop trying to find reasons for why what they are currently doing is good enough and actually work to reach their potential, if being strong is something that they are really interested in. If you do that you don't need to say ""I'm strong *if you consider X Y and Z*"", you can just say ""I am strong"".

Anyways, the whole reason I made this post was to share [this video by Alex Bromley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvGTlUt7Y3k&ab_channel=AlexanderBromley) that was linked on /r/weightroom earlier today. I think the average user here will get more value out of this than the average user there. I didn't want to dump a link without any context. 

And this is probably not worth saying as the kind of people likely to be guilty of this won't read this far anyways but please *actually watch the video* before commenting for or against any ideas *you think* might be presented within in. Also if you want to address a specific point please try to include a general timestamp so anyone interested can find the exact context without searching through a 20 minute video.

*Edited to better articulate/clarify the point and better represent the content of the video."
