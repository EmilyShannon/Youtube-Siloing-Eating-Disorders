Disordered,"TW Weight  Disclaimer: I've never been underweight I have atypical anorexia. 

I've been in recovery for a few months now and have just decided to finally eat without thinking. I have started to notice that I look a lot more ""plump"" than I used to but have been avoiding weighing myself. However, I do taekwondo and had a competition recently and they need to put you in weight classes. So I had to be weighed and so now I know my weight. It's the heaviest I have been in my whole life and it's making me want to stop seeing my psych and dietitian because I feel like they're just going to make me keep gaining even though I don't need to. According to healthy weight ranges I'm in the upper half which is making me scared that I'll soon be in the overweight category. It's really messing with me and I'm so close to relapsing and going back to unhealthy eating habbits."
Disordered,"tw + calorie count  Hi, i’ve posted here before , but it’s been a while, and most of that time i’ve been eating normal, but school started back up, and it’s a new reason to go back to my habits. Whenever I eat, i feel sick to my stomach, and i restrict to 690 calories at most of which i usually end up purging; exercise or vomiting. I know it’s not healthy, but since i’m not a normal weight, or underweight, i see it as an excuse to continue doing it, because i actually lose the weight. I can tell it’s taking a toll, but my mind is set to: “I can do more, I can sat less.”My insomnia is getting worse, my family even noticed I eat way less than I used to. My parents give me less servings, which kind of fuels my thoughts. Before, my family would give me huge servings, now i get way lighter plates.  One of my good friends knows of my problem though, as i’m a pretty funny, and outgoing person around her , i often crack jokes about it, on accident. my mind has been sooo f’d, I feel like passing out 24/7, and i can barely walk sometimes. The problem is, i’m still “fat” in my eyes. I’m so confused as to why I can’t eat food and not feel sick anymore though. Does this mean i’ll never recover if i ever decide to?

TLDR:
I’m anorexic, with bulimic tendencies , i restrict my calories to 690 the most. Why do i feel so sick every time i eat a meal? Does this mean I can’t  recover?"
Disordered,"tw: rant/ed  Okay so i usually limit myself to 800 cals a day as long as i am burning the cals after i eat them. i have been very successful with this and simply feel better than if i was to eat and have a normal diet. anytime i eat my stomach just hurts and i don't feel good. if i don't eat i tend to have more motivation to get up and do stuff, i also feel prettier and more successful. i have lost around 20 lbs in a short amount of time just because of this. i just want to know peoples opinions and thoughts and if they might know if this feeling is my ed or if something could genuinely be wrong with my health. i don't know how to explain it the best but if my stomach is empty i feel clean. please reply with thought, opinions, or even if you relate. i really want to see what people have to say. thank you!"
Disordered,"Should I eat or nah?  For the past 4 weeks or so, i have only been eating 1 meal a day. I normally eat 2 meals a day since i don't really eat breakfast, but then recently, i felt SUPER GUILTY of eating 2 meals a day, so what i would do is eat only lunch or only dinner. I definitely feel hungry for those time periods that i should be eating, but when i weigh myself on the scale and see a smaller number, i feel happiness. When im super duper hungry tho, i would force myself to eat two meals, but that's just rarely. Yesterday, i only ate i bag of chips. Then this day, i didn't eat any lunch at school, and i actually felt tired and week because i didn't really eat anything, and then i walked home from school (a pretty long walk) and i felt super tired, and i thought tha i should probably eat something, but then i weighed myself again and saw that i lost 1 kilo in 2 days, and i got so happy that i forgot about my hunger. I cooked rice earlier and was thinking if i should cook sausage to partner with rice, or should i wait till tomorrow to eat my meal? I don't know. Im afraid that after i eat, im gonna gain weight again."

(Idk if this goes against the rules)  I just moved into my college dorm and we’ve been doing peer bonding and familiarizing ourselves with the campus the past few days. Starting tomorrow, classes will begin and I plan on having between 750-1000 calories a school day and 600 on weekends like I did in high school. Ik college courses are more vigorous so I’m wondering if it will be enough to learn and study well."
Disordered,"Almost 1 year into recovery  When I finally hit my rock bottom & decided I wanted to recover, I was going between 90-96lbs ( 40 - 43.6kg) I'm 5'6.

The first year was a mess of relapses & binge eating & extreme hunger & relapsing again, just repetitive and exhausting. 
But last November was the last time I relapsed, and I've not had one for months. 

So much of recovery focuses on weight gain - while I know that's important, I also knew I'd scare myself and potentially do more harm than good if I suddenly gained lots of weight. So instead, I focused on  weight maintenence. Not *gaining* weight, just *not losing any more of it*. 
I increased my portions.
I ate more regularly, though I didn't eat lots. 
I made myself focus on ingredients rather than calories.
I stopped weighing myself.

Now, almost 1 year into recovery without relapsing, I haven't weighed myself in months. But last time I did, I was 102lbs (46.4kg). 
Now I'm going to actively eat (& exercise) to gain weight, rather than maintain it. 

My goal is 120lbs (54.4kg)."

I can't even look at my body anymore I want to cut myself and rip out all the disgusting yellow the fat. my self harm has gotten worse since I started looking at those posts. I need help. I don't stop untill I can see the fat spill out from the cut and it doesn't hurt at all. it doesn't phase me. when I work and look down and see my arms and fingers and think about how gross they look and how much I hate myself.

Disordered,"rapid weight gain  Hello guys.
So i got a Problem here
I am in recovery from anorexia and i try to get back eating food. This week i want to try eating everyday. From monday to thursday i gained 7kg of weight ( on my scale)
So here what i ate :
Monday : two bowls of salad, hummus, nuts, pickles, mozarella and meat. 
And a little chocolate Bar.
Tuesday: the same bowl of salad and some ""mental Hunger sweets"" who Was half of a chips bag, a whole chocolate Bar.
Thursday:
Granola with vegan Milk and nuts and some cookies. 
Wednesday:
The same bowl of salad but with a half salmon. 
And cookies.
Some pieces of watermelon

So is this rapid weight gain bc i had this ""extreme hunger phase""? ( its not like i such a sweetoth, i am more into fruits but atm my body wants sweets)
It doesnt go away and it seems like i really gained weight.
( i know i got Lots of water retention after eating, so its not all ""real weight"". But is it impossible to gain like 3kg in a week bc of anorexia recovery? 
The meals i ate These days dont got me a surplus of what i am loosing on a day.
All of my body looks so chubby.
I know thats not the Thing in recovery but bc of that i am so afraid that i am gaining an amount of weight back and Falling into the circle of restriction again.
Or is it normal? Does the weight go away?( bc i know tjere can be Lots of water retention). Is the body holding water retention and food weight longer than ""other people""? Or does my body stored that directly??"

Disordered,"Do I have an ED?  TW: Numbers

I've been restricting for almost an entire year. I lost my period 7 months ago and I'm a little underweight (not severely though as I'm 97 lbs at 5""2). I had been sticking to a strict 700 - 800 kcal meal plan for a long time.

As a result, I'm tired all the time, can't get any sleep, have no energy and have been really depressed. I had my first appointment with a psychiatrist. She referred me to a dietician. However, I'm not able to talk to her yet because the appointment is two months away. I can´t wait that long. So a couple of weeks ago, I decided to try to ""recover"" on my own, because life has become so miserable that I'm willing to take matters into my own hands.

Ive managed to slowly increase my caloric intake. I started eating a little under 1200 kcal. Granted, I'm not very consistent and haven't reached my maintenance calories yet, but somehow I feel hungrier and more tired than ever? Is this extreme hunger or just an urge to binge and should I give in to it? I've been considering ""going all in"", but I feel uncomfortable not having a professional to guide me through this process. I want to start recovering now, but I'm not sure if what I'm doing is right, or if there's a serious problem to begin with? How do I cope with this extreme hunger and the fear of gaining weight?"
Disordered,"treated like a glass doll  what is the appeal of being treated like you're going to break by everyone? why is such a common motivator for restricting to be treated so delicately like that? i get treated like that all of the time because of how thin, sickly, and frail i look (yeah i know for sure because if i'm around a person doing that for an extended period of time i lose my shit and ask them what their fucking problem is lol.) and it makes me feel like a useless little child or the middle school sped kid that everyone drags out words for and pretends to like. being 18, the slightest bit intelligent, and still genuinely being talked down to with so much pity because of being so tiny and sick makes me want to scream and die. i guess it's just fucking heroes that see an anorexic girl and talk slowly and forcefully nice to her because :((( i guess!!!

Disordered,"Good and bad news: will it go away eventually?  Greetings, friends!

Good news first: I think I may be finally recovering. I have finally admitted to myself that I need to get better.

Bad news: I am dealing with major facial swelling. I have a history of it, and I have already thought it could be SIBO, that it could be histamine related, gluten, dairy, etc. etc., but it gets to the point where it seems intolerance to \*food\* really — leaving my eating disorder, and recovery of it, as potential triggers to this.

Disordered,"might not be able to go to college  a few months back, i went to the doctors and they were a little concerned about my weight. at my next check up about a month ago, my mom mentioned that. i was(and still am) underweight at the time, so of course now the doctor is very concerned. so, i’m ordered to gain about 10 pounds, give or take, within 5 weeks.

well, i go back 5 weeks later(which was two days ago), and i hadn’t gained anything. i suppose i didn’t really take it seriously… i didn’t realize the actual repercussions of what would happen. i was still deep in my ed mindset. and now this has just been a slap in the face. i have a cardiologist appointment on monday and if they don’t clear me, i can’t go to college. but even then, my own doctor may not even clear me if i don’t gain at least 2 pounds by tuesday at my next appointment. he even mentioned an eating disorder clinic.

i’m so fucking terrified of having my life put on hold and not being able to go to my first year of college. i don’t want to go to a fucking clinic. i want to go to college. 

it’s like my ed doesn’t even exist rn, i’m just so constantly stressed about not being able to gain weight and go to college. like yes, i hate the idea of gaining the weight but the idea of not going to college is fucking terrifying. idk what to do. i just want to live my life. ik i did this to myself but i hate this so much. i just want to be normal."

I’m 24, I haven’t been diagnosed with any eating disorder and don’t want to be disrespectful by claiming to be. However, for as long as I can remember, I struggle with body dismorphia. It makes it hard for me to have any confidence in my self and in how I look. These negative thoughts have led me to have an unbalance relationship with food but it’s manageable and I’ve learnt to deal with it. Recently, I gained weight and I was okay with that but I found out that it was caused by some minor health issues that I am confident will be resolved soon. 
But… 
I can’t lie and say that it hasn’t affected me…
I’ve developed this irrational fear of meeting people and socialising because I feel as though I have “gained weight” written on my forehead and that people judge me and make fun of me for it or that I’m not someone people would want to get to know.
I try to reason with myself, especially that I’d never think that way of someone else. I do know that it comes from things I went through when I was younger and bullied at school.
It’s really tiring and it’s starting to affect how I eat and I’ve started intermittent fasting (which has helped with my heath stuff) but I’m just scared of this loop of negativity and anxiety I’ve gotten into."

But I also feel like a fake because even though I’ve been trying to fast a few days a week and stick to 500cal the other days, some days I fail and eat more. Not tonnes more, but more. I try and purge after as much as possible.    
But I don’t think it can be an Ed because I’m still fat.     
And it’s not really about being skinny, it’s about having control and achieving something. My body will never be gorgeous, and I can live with that. But I want the peace that comes with knowing I have done something I set out to do. I want to feel like I’m not a failure, even though I do fail at this most days.

I don’t know if I have an eating disorder or not

Im super picky, right, but it’s more than that. If a certain food has the wrong texture, no. If it has the wrong taste, no. Wrong smell, no. 

And then I feel like I have a limit, like I can’t eat after I’ve reached it

If I do eat past my “limit” or my “rules,” I feel horrible. Like nauseous, guilty, like I’ve done something wrong.

And I always have a little subconscious track on numbers. I know how many calories are in certain foods, how many calories humans need a day versus how many for a diet. I have my weight in my head. About a year ago, I was 120 lbs. Now I’m about 104 lbs. and every time the scale shows a lower number I feel happy, for some stupid reason.

And when my bones are a little more prominent I feel happy. 

I know I was never overweight, and I know I’m not currently. I’m fairly happy with my body, except for a few little fattier spots like my neck/chin and my hips/stomach, but not enough that I *have* to do something about it.

But I don’t know what kind of disorder I would have if I even do? Because maybe I’m  being dramatic. But I feel like this is all about control

I have no control in my life at times, and recently my other controlling factor (self-h4rming) has been found out, so I can’t really keep doing that. So I need to control through food, I guess

I also have emetophobia, so whenever I eat something bad Im terrified I’ll get sick and throw up and that’s scary.

So yeah. If you could offer some advice or just knowledge on what’s going on that would be great.

Thanks, have a lovely day/night"

Disordered,"Do I have an eating disorder?  Do I have an eating disorder?

For some background, I’m f16, 5’3 108lbs. I’ve always been naturally thin and never had to worry much about what I ate. My family is pretty healthy and active too, so not a lot of junk in my house.

But for these past few months I’ve had a weird relationship with food and my weight - some days I was fine and could eat whatever I wanted, and on others, I didn’t want to eat anything and had a calculator in my head counting the number of calories I consumed/burned. I’ve tried calorie limits and all that, but nothing too crazy and I was fine.

However, right now I'm trying to lose weight. I'm trying out to be a coxswain, and I feel very pressured to get lighter to be better for that position. The minimum is 110lbs, but I want to be a lot less so I have room to gain weight with muscle. My goal was to lose a few pounds, get in better shape, and eat better. But that’s not really what’s happening. Recently I’ve had a really hard time eating. I count EVERYTHING (using an app), and exercise every day, burning somewhere between 500–1000+ calories. I skip every meal I can (usually breakfast and lunch). My usual diet usually consists of a salad (330), tic tacs (0), a Celsius (10), and either some sort of vegetable or eggs when I’m feeling very faint, sometimes with a low-carb tortilla (~100-250). On days I feel more “normal”, I’ll eat something sweet, like yesterday I was really craving ice cream (350), but of course, I just worked out more to burn it. I weigh myself constantly throughout the day and spend most of my time either working out or thinking about food. I usually have a net of 300–500. I hate myself after eating anything that isn’t vegetables and lie to my family and friends about already having eaten.

I’ve been practically starving myself and working out for hours for about a week now and hardly changed in weight. I think it’s because I’m not eating enough so my body is slowing down my metabolism or something, but I just can’t get myself to eat a proper meal. I get easily irritated, especially when I’m extremely hungry, and sometimes feel so weak I feel like I can’t even stand up. I hate my body, and sometimes I feel so terrible I’ll find some way to hurt myself (nothing too bad, but I do have cuts all over my stomach). I know this isn’t exactly normal, but I’m just wondering if this qualifies as some sort of ED, or if someone has experienced something to this. My goal is to get to 104lbs by the end of the month, but I have a feeling I won’t be satisfied with that number. I’ll probably keep this up until I get around 94. I don’t know.

Anyways, yeah. Curious to hear what people think."

i feel like I'm stuck in a rut, binge, restrict, binge, restrict, and even that time where i thought i had everything under control and i was eating normally for a while of course it went downhill, i ended up bingeing again, and eating anything started to become stressful again, I've been trying to get back on my schedule of 3 meals a day and eating something every 3-4 hours but it's just difficult now

whenever i eat or feel hungry i feel disgusting and gluttonous 

i only see my therapist once every two weeks, and i can't ask for that to increase because my parents will ask why and if they know about all of this they'll just make it so much worse

one of my new pe curriculum's primary focuses is weight, and i asked my therapist about getting alternative assignments when there was an activity about it but she said she needs parental permission to contact the school. even though she can give me a letter to give to the school, im scared that the school will need parental permission to alter my lessons and assignments 


I've joined 5 different vent-based discord servers and they've all done one of 4 things:

""if you're overweight up your exercise and start dieting"", i already exercise for a huge part of the day, and i have too many issues with eating to be able to effectively diet, but nobody actually wants to help me with those

""you need to learn to love yourself"", i don't know *how*. That's part of what I'm seeking help on. But nobody wants to help me, they just want to tell me what i already know

i went on tumblr for any kind of help, i was in for a ride awakening. It's all pro-ana shit or fetishization. There's a bot that came up, kokobot, but it says that it's not a safe place to talk about eds. I don't know why it popped up while i was searching various ed terms or why it has an option for eating disorders when it asks you what you're struggling with then, but it did. There are a few helpful tips there but they're all for anorexia and i think binge eating is my big problem rn

And it's funny how whenever i talk about this stuff everyone always says ""it doesn't matter what others think of you, beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" but then i talk about how other people only ever talk about how I'm so beautiful or whatever and i just don't like the way i look, they say ""everyone thinks you're beautiful, so you must be"" or something along those lines. It makes me feel so invalidated, people only want to contrast my opinion of myself, and it makes me frustrated. Imagine telling the truth and everyone just keeps insisting you're lying. That's how it feels. 

What's more, r/EatingDisorders apparently doesn't allow fucking cries for help. I feel so, so rejected. 

I'm coming here because i feel like i have nowhere else. Please read the whole thing and don't respond with some of the things I've listed that are frustrating. If you can't think of anything else i don't care i won't hold it against you if you just don't respond. I at the very least need some kind of effective comfort."
Disordered,Is drinking too much a symptom of my ed?  I know it’s two separate issues but it’s like they fuel eachother. At my lw I was going out every weekend and drinking more than I should have. I don’t think they were related at that point but after I went through a depression and ended up gaining. Now that the depression is over I went out last night without eating got drunk. Came home and drank more. Then I ate. Now I’m a lw again. I feel like alcohol just cancels out the fact that I ate.
Disordered,"considering recovery  this was supposed to be me asking for advice, but it kind of turned into me rambling / venting. so, if you dont want to read all of this: if anyone has experiences with getting professional help for your ed and committing to recovery, and maybe knows what to expect when turning to a mental health clinic about it, please share!!

long story short, i want to recover because im tired and exhausted and im worrying my family, but i dont know where to start getting professional help.

long story long, my ed seriously started in october 2021. i have lost a fair amount of weight since then and went from a healthy weight to being underweight. a couple months in, my parents started getting really worried because they had noticed me skipping meals and losing weight quickly, so they kept a close eye on me which forced me to... ""recover"". lets just say, my mindset around food did not change a bit, and whenever i ate ""unhealthy"" foods or just bigger portions, i would still feel awful and beat myself up over it. still though, i ate, and so after a while my parents thought it was over and i was better.
i relapsed really badly when i noticed they stopped caring. i noticed my weight gain and began restricting heavily again, going to more extreme measures than before. this also went on for a couple months, bringing us to today.
as i was making my breakfast, my mom came up to me and said she was worried because i looked so thin - i usually wear baggy clothes, today i wore a regular shirt. she started tracing my bones etc through my shirt and i could tell it really upset her. later, she sat me down and had a big long talk with me about my relationship with food, and whether i was losing weight on purpose. eventually i gave in and finally started being honest about it, in a very diluted way - i did not go into detail but i mentioned that maybe i do restrict to become skinnier. she asked me if ive talked about it to my therapist, which i havent - unfortunately, my therapist is on vacation this entire month, so even if i wanted to, i couldnt get professional help from her. my mom offered to take me to a local mental health clinic if things got too bad. i know this is really worrying and stressful to her, especially because she was pretty much oblivious to it for a long time, and now its this whole serious situation that i didnt even want it to become.
anyways, i told her id be fine on my own for now, but im not so sure if thats true. i have been considering recovery for a good while now. i hate that the only thing on my mind is food, i hate that i cannot enjoy any events at any time of day because im constantly worried about what im going to be eating. i miss food and i miss having fun and i miss not caring. and now, on top of that, i have the added burden of being the problem child and worrying my lovely and supportive parents for what feels like no good reason if i continue my disordered behavior.
so at this point, i want to recover. but i dont think i can do this alone, at home, with no supervision or professional help whatsoever. sure, i could wait until my therapist is back, but she doesnt even know about all of this. itll be overwhelming and take long enough to even tell her, and i dont think anything will come from it immediately. but i dont know if i can keep living like this at this point in time, i feel awful, my family feels awful, i feel so exhausted from just everything.
however, i feel like if i went to this nearby clinic, i wouldnt be sick enough to receive any treatment. im so, so afraid that im making way too big of a deal out of this, and that theyd dismiss me and send me back home because, i dont know, maybe i look healthy enough or maybe they dont consider someone who eats two meals a day as anorexic, because theres people who eat less.
i also have no idea of what to expect if i go there. all i really want for now is to talk to someone about it and see what they have to say from a professional standpoint, but i dont know whether theyd just prescribe me calorie supplements, or if id receive treatment and have to stay there, or if id just be sent home and be just as clueless and hopeless as before.
i just dont know what to do. :("
Disordered,"In ED recovery, now watching my BFF descend into it...I don't think she can be in my life  Burner account here, and this is a rant. TW on behaviors, numbers, etc.

But the question is: Can two people with eating disorders be friends?

I have battled with disordered eating on and off throughout my life. I'm in my early 40s now. You'd think I would have this figured out by now.  About 4 years ago, I dropped down to a dangerously low weight. But, as so many of us have experienced, the ""you're too skinny"" was a welcome compliment. I was accomplishing something. I was proud of my xylophone ribs (and all the rest). I relished my routine of exercise, eating ""clean,"" wearing tiny sizes. I've had a lot of shift in the last year and started to slow down on the exercising, eat more normally. It's part of my pattern. At some point, the heart palpitations and aching bones just suck. I can't keep up the rigor of that routine. But it's not that I don't want to...which is the disordered part.My best friend of 20+ years decided she wanted to get a ""Revenge bod"" last summer. And I saw all the signs; obsessive exercise, tracking her weight on her bathroom mirror, eating little to nothing, getting angry when other people weren't eating, getting angry when anyone questioned her behavior. Ostensibly, she says she is the ""healthiest she's ever been"" -- yes, training for a marathon while also, you know, smoking. But worse, is that it is all she talks about; how much weight she's lost, how much she's exercising, her ""veganism."" She coaches other friends on how if they just worked out they'd be so much happier. She's ""HAPPY"" because she's skinny. I think she is doing a ton of damage...I think she is bulimic, as well. (She has a history of that behavior.) She's downing Tums constantly, complaining of heartburn.I finally talked to her about how I knew what she was doing, and while I loved her and wanted her to be happy,  I know this is  self-destruction and I can't be a part of it. She accused me of being toxic and unsupportive and, of course, jealous.Can two people with this struggle be friends? Are we really going to sit across from each other at a dinner and judge what you're eating v. what I'm eating? Am I going to have to look at you dying for me to tell you how skinny you are, when I think you look sick? Or better, tell you you're too skinny and see that same gleam I used to get when people said that to me?Do we just put aside 20 years of friendship, being with each other through marriages, divorces, kids, parent's dying, because this disorder is now always sitting at the table with both of us and I'm triggered as hell?"
Disordered,"Help  Trigger warning: health issues, test results, mental health

So I've always had a bad relationship with food. For as long as I remember I've over eaten to the point of feeling sick and hidden food in my room so that nobody knew how much i was actually eating. My mother used to comment on it frequently but ofcourse that just made me hide it better. 

For a year or so I managed to really focus on exercising and eating healthily, almost entirely cutting out snacking. Then I had a child and snacking was more convenient.

For the last few years I have continued to gain weight. Ive had many people comment that I should actually be alot bigger than I am because of what I eat and how much I do eat. 

I have some preexisting health issues so i had noticed that my pain levels have increased and i live a pretty sedentary lifestyle which isnt great but I thought that was just down to my pain. Now I think that the bingeing, then gaining weight, is actually what has increased my pain and in turn made me struggle more with activity. I also noticed that im more breathless and getting sick more often but didnt think much of it. Que to most recently - ive been suffering with some stomach issues that we are struggling to find the cause of. I do have scans soon but recent blood tests revealed some deficiencies that are mainly caused by malnourishment. I am so exhausted all of the time and it is making me depressed. I cannot believe that my eating is causing all of this. And to make matters worse, im still bingeing! Probably more so! I feel sick every night at bed time because i spend hours consistently snacking when im not even hungry but i cant stop. Is there any hope for me?? Anyone got any tips?


Tldr : bingeing is causing malnourishment, worsening health issues and making me depressed and fatigued. Any advice?"
Disordered,"Don’t want to get better. Tw! Numbers and talk about weight and loss! Don’t read if you are struggling. Reader have been warned.  I don’t want to get better. I don’t want to start eating food in a “normal” way. Honestly I am tired of people telling me to eat. I don’t care. I want to see the numbers go down. I crave the effects it has on my body, good or bad. 

I can manage fainting or loosing hair. I’ve lost way to much to stop now. 

I really shouldn’t be posting this and I hope I don’t upset anyone but I just need to get it of my chest. 

For every kilo I loose, the prouder I get. The feeling of maintaining a number or ever lowering it is the best feeling ever. I can’t explain it, it’s euphoric almost. 

The rush of emotions I get when I see my shoulders getting “pointier” or my thigh gap (which I didn’t have before) getting larger, my rib cage becoming more pronounced is just enthralling. I want to loose more, and fast. 

When I started this “journey” I had just begun taking my adhd medication. The elvanse helps me suppress my hunger and acts like a two-in-one diet/attention pill, which is great! In October of last year I was slightly over weight, but as I started loosing more weight I reached my first mile stone. 50 kg was a really safe spot for me as I had gotten to the weight I was two years ago. But as time passed on, I started to realize that I wanted more. I wanted- no I need to be smaller. 

I’ve now lost 3 more kg since then and I want to loose more. No one can change my mind. 

When people tell me that I am getting too skinny or being worried that I have relapsed again, I feel so happy. That means that it is noticeable enough to to see progress. 

Telling me that I am too skinny or “sick looking” is not a wake up call. It’s a reward, a compliment if you will. I’ll never be disappointed to hear how small I’ve gotten. 

My friend keeps calling me anorexic. I don’t believe that I am but the thrill of hearing someone compare me to that of someone who has lost severe weight and who is dying of the disorder. 

I don’t want comments telling me to get better, I know what I’m doing. There’s no point, because I won’t stop. 

I apologize if this has triggered anyone and I’m sorry if you are going through a heard time. I really just needed an outlet to talk about this."
Disordered,"I need help, someone to talk too & im kinda embarrassed to post this  So idk if anyones going to read this but like I’m trying really hard to recover and I have been doing semi okay the past few months but the urge to control my food is overwhelming. Recently I just relapsed like super hard I’ve been bingeing 3 times a day and purging at least twice. I was anorexic and bulimic in the past year and have dealt with this since I was 16, I’m 22 now. I don’t want to relapse everyone thinks I’m doing so much better and I’m fixed and I don’t want to tell anyone bc I know they’ll be disappointed. I’ve just never hated my body so much before and I feel so trapped. I wear sweats and huge t shirts everyday and I haven’t looked in the mirror truly in about 7 months, I close my eyes whenever I shower so I don’t have to see my body and every guy that tries to talks to me I ghost bc I don’t want them to be disappointed by my appearance. I also work out upwards of 3 hours a day. Another thing to note is that I’ve never really gone to therapy I tried once but therapy made it worse and my mom doesn’t think I need a psychiatrist. I think I have kind of a toxic family— for context when my parents first found out I was purging I remember her screaming from the top of the stairs how stupid I was and then threatening to tell my entire family if I didn’t stop. I had to send her an article of what not to say to someone who is struggling with eating bc shes told me the most horrible things. I feel like I’m losing control of everything. I just want to love my body but I don’t think I ever will. I also just want someone to talk too I feel like I’m so alone in this. My ex best friend replaced me bc she said “it was too much for her” and my friends now just kinda brush it off. I also can’t talk to my parents bc they don’t really like talking abt that stuff. So I guess this kind of turned into a rant, I just feel so alone right now. I myself and I don’t know how to fix that."
Disordered,"Advice/ help wanted (TW)  Some info before I get into the main problem: I’ve had a restrictive ED for the last 3 years I’d say and this year I’ve been doing better, not good but not as restrictive as I used to be. I always always always eat dinner, but recently I got sick and got a pretty sore throat. I was also on holiday so I couldn’t workout so I relapsed, now that I’m back to my normal schedule and health I’ve been trying to eat. I’ve been only able to eat a few bites of anything and then I’m not hungry or I feel nauseous. I can’t eat hot food because it burns my throat and just destroys my appetite.

Disordered,"Did you have a bad experience with treatment for anorexia?  &#x200B;

I was first diagnosed with Anorexia nervosa when I was twelve year old boy. Shortly thereafter I was enrolled in a specialized program for people with eating disorders on an outpatient basis. I came to the hospital every week and I'd get weighed and see a therapist and nutritionist. I hated the weighing part because If I was considered too skinny I was warned by the staff that I would have to be hospitalized. So, I started eating out of fear of being hospitalized, not because they had magically cured me. I still thought I was fat, and I still hated being over a certain weight.

The lowest point in my treatment was in my teens. I started losing a lot of weight because I was depressed and isolated at school. On top of that I was terrified of being hospitalized.  At one point I even came close to being admitted. When I turned eighteen I left the program because I was past the age limit, but my Anorexia was never cured. Even now I can’t associate that hospital with anything other than my nightmarish treatment. 

Has anyone else experienced treatment that left them traumatized or even made their disorder worse?"
Disordered,Do I have an eating disorder?  I have generalized anxiety disorder. This I know for sure. I’m diagnosed and on medication. However a symptom of my anxiety is loss of appetite. I’ve never really thought about it until recently when I was reading a book and a character who has GAD would stop themselves from eating whenever they were extremely anxious because it made them feel like they were in control and it made me wonder. I have no motivation for not eating. I’m very happy with my body. If anything I’m a little too skinny as I have a high metabolism. I’m not trying to change my body when I don’t eat. I just simply can’t bring myself to eat because my anxiety makes me lose my appetite.  I also generally just don’t eat that much. 1-2 small meals a day. Although I am trying to work on this and I’m a big snacker. The worst was when I had went through an extreme traumatic episode and I essentially ate next to nothing for almost a month. I was extremely underweight and got very very sick. I didn’t link the two together until recently. I’m wondering if this counts as an eating disorder or is it just loss of appetite?

Disordered,"How Josh Peck OVERCAME his Addiction To Food + Drugs  So Drake and Josh was a huge staple for me growing up for me. It was one of my favorite shows.

Until I read Josh Peck’s book, I really didn't know much about him, but I resonated a lot with the fact that he was overweight, was this awkward goofy kid to losing the weight and getting a girlfriend. You really see him change throughout the show. And I just felt like I resonated with that a lot.

And after reading his book I learned so much about addiction to food. I learned how my addiction to food may have affected my own life and why I even had it. So if you're struggling with addiction or if you've struggled with addiction, I hope this post resonates with you, and I hope you gain some value from this.

And I above all want you to read his book.

So growing up, he was just like me. He had a single mom and his dad left him. And I think that may have created some abandonment issues in him. And left him feeling like he wasn't enough. He implies that in the book. And I definitely feel the same way. That's just speculation.

But I can say in my own life that this insecurity definitely played into my addictions. Growing up, Josh was in love with food. And for me personally, I don't remember being in love or addicted to food, until specifically, there were traumas that happened, like my dad leaving or other things. The moment I got fat was the exact same time that these traumas happened.

I didn't really put the pieces in together until later on in life, which is kind of crazy. And Josh used food to cope with these emotions. He used it to feel good. And the central theme of their entire house was food. So much so that his mom, who also had an eating disorder, would constantly be on a diet, constantly fluctuating weight.

They would also binge together. They would go out to a restaurant and then they would get a bunch of snacks. And then they would go in their own rooms in their house and binge eat. And to Josh, it was fun. He was just a kid. He was just like, yeah, this is just the way life is. But obviously that's a very unhealthy relationship to food.

So at Josh's prime, he weighed 297 pounds. In his own words, he said he would've had to have been six foot 10 and from Samoa for this weight to sit correctly on his frame. Now I didn't get bullied a lot for my weight, but I was overweight. I was obese, but I wasn't that bad, but it was still something that I hated.

And I tried dieting and I couldn't lose it. It was so frustrating to try to lose weight, to feel like you don't have the willpower, to feel insecure about the way you looked and just not be healthy. And I wasn't playing sports. I. wasn't one of the “cool kids”. I felt very disconnected from my social circle or my group in school just like Josh.

He said it was way worse because in the nineties being overweight just meant open season. Like everyone's gonna make fun of you cuz there was no anti-bullying campaign. There's no body positivity back then. And what's worse is he weighed way more. It was a huge pain point for him, and I know a lot of overweight people can resonate with that.

He describes it as this downward cycle. you're fat. So you get made fun of, and you feel shitty about yourself, which makes you eat more to cope with your bad emotions, which makes you more fat and so on and so forth. And on the bright side of all this, all this eating and teasing gave Josh a really good sense of humor.

And what he meant by that is he would compensate for his insecurities with laughter with jokes, with being funny. He said that if he can make you laugh, then maybe you won't make fun of him. Matter of fact, if he can make you laugh, maybe he can control the entire conversation or the energy in the room.

Comedy to Josh was a superpower. There's a quote from the book that I really like. And it says, “The reason why people are funny is usually not funny at all.”

And I know a lot of people from books that I've read that are funny because of their insecurities, for example, will Smith.

He became such an entertainer because he wanted to ease the tension at his home because his father was very abusive towards his mom. He was getting bullied at school and in his own words, you can't be mad, hateful or racist when you're doubled over laughing.

Eventually Josh would have to face this aversion to himself and actually be himself instead of a character, but that's gonna come a lot later in his life.

In the meantime, him being funny, turned into not only a passion, but a career. He was doing standup comedy at eight years old. He started doing commercials, getting gigs for movies, small movies, big movies and as we all know, eventually a whole TV show with his name on it. He started getting paid and his mom and his financial burdens were being alleviated through him.

He started paying the bills. He moved them all out to Cali, all from this passion of comedy that was created from this insecurity to feel good enough to get validation. And I think it's so incredible that out of all of this pain came something really good. If you ever get bored, just watch some highlights of that show and you'll see that it was really a funny show and there's a reason why it's still playing today.

They ended up filming 60 episodes and two movies. And over the course of the whole series, he loses 127 pounds. The fact that the entire weight loss journey was documented on TV made a lot of people, judge him for losing weight. Isn't that crazy? Like, can you imagine,

“Sir, can you, uh, not change your character, please just stay unhealthy and be considerate because we're all wanting you to stay the same.”

People were objecting to him being healthy and improving his life.

But, in his own words, because he lost all of the weight, he started doing drugs.

Losing the weight didn't change his mind. It only changed his body.

This makes a lot of sense to me because when I eventually lost my weight, that's kind of, when I started doing drugs and fell into other addictions

The addiction to escaping myself, didn't go away.

Merely the food part was under control, but even then I was still fluctuating weight a lot. I had my weight under control. But there was a lot of binging and dieting and binging and dieting. That was just simply the same broken brain in a new body. It was just never stable. I even remember a lot of my friends saying, Danny, you lose weight and gain weight very, very frequently and very fast.

For Josh, He was 18 years old. He had lost all of his weight. He was in control of his eating. He had quote unquote made it. He had his own hit TV show, making money, things were looking good. The future was bright, but his brain hasn't caught up to his success yet. He had a broken brain in a new body, and this is when he started using drugs.

So he started using drugs for the same reason why he overate to escape that feeling of being him.

And I'm starting to realize that any addiction that I might have is just because I'm not confronting me.

And I'm avoiding myself through external things through external pleasures.

He did cocaine for the first time when he was 18 with his girlfriend, he just did it to feel normal and fit in.

And when he first did it, he said he didn't feel anything. He said he guessed it didn't work. He went to a party. He was extremely social. If anything, he just felt like himself. And that's the crazy part. The drugs made him feel like more of himself for the first time. He didn't feel the pain of just existing. He mistook being high for being alive.

Imagine carrying an invisible backpack full of pain and trauma, your entire life. And then drugs are these magical potions that can make the weight of that backpack instantly feel lighter. He had been searching for a medicine like this, his entire life.

**The lie we tell ourselves is as I am, I am not enough.**

And that night for him doing drugs for the first time, he felt like enough. And the change was subtle. It took a few nights just like that before he noticed a change, he felt like at first he was in control. And I totally understand that because in my journey I've done drugs and I felt like they were helping me.

I convinced myself, they were making me more social, more confident, a better person. When in reality, they were doing the opposite. They were just crutches for not feeling like I was. In his head, he was getting relief. And for the next four years, he was chasing that feeling of being okay. Of being enough.

And he ruined a lot of opportunity in the process and to backtrack a little, how did Josh lose the weight?…

What was the secret?…

There was no secret. Diet and exercise, baby. He just did it. And that was the same experience for me.

One day I came home from a very long vacation and I'd gotten the most fat I had ever been. I was straight up obese at that point and everyone was making fun of me.

I grew up from an Asian household and they're very vocal about your weight. And I remember there's was a family friend that I had a huge crush on and she grabbed my cheeks and she said, “Danny, oh my God, you got so chubby.” And in that moment, my heart shattered. That same day, it wasn't even a decision or a goal.

I just started running. I just stopped eating. I lost the weight.

Here's my theory. **When the pain of staying the same hurts more than the pain of change and discipline and willpower and transformation, you will change.** At that moment of just straight pain, Both Josh and I just started working out and doing the work day in and day out.

But here's the problem. One addiction can easily replace the other. What's more important than fixing your diet or putting a bandaid on your problems is fixing your mind and figuring out the place that the addiction is coming from.

If you don't fix the insecurity and the feeling in your, in your mind, you won't be happy.

You feel like you won't deserve to be.

No amount of validation or external things will help you. And this is when Josh realized. The drug addiction was out of control.

For a six week period, he worked on this movie called the Wackness. It was a role of him being a drug dealer and trading drugs for therapy to this crazy therapist.

And the role was so perfect for Josh and he was working with some of his favorite co-stars that he actually quit drugs for six weeks just to shoot this movie.

And during the showing, they won at the film festival, they won a bunch of awards. He got a standing ovation. Everyone wanted to interview him.

And all he wanted to do was go home because he hated that he felt like he didn't deserve any of it. He didn't feel like he deserved to win. And it was after this that he realized that he needed help and he started going to AA.

He started going to meetings. He started getting accountability. And he got off drugs sober, and he found a community that supported him.

But more importantly, they understood him his pain and his trauma. And while he was in no way fixed from just being sober, he says that it was the start of his journey of self actualizing and accepting himself.

Reading this book has made me realize that for addiction, it's important to look at the root of the addiction, the cause.

And it's forced me to look inward and ask myself. Why? Why am I craving that thing? What emotion am I trying to cover up? What am I running away from? And for me, I'm constantly running away from my emotions and what I'm feeling and as time goes on, I'm getting much better at identifying when I'm in a rut.

And when I'm not feeling good mentally, I’d rather just sit with that emotion and not let it control me to make an impulsive decision that I don't even wanna make.

One thing that I’ve done that helps a lot is meditation

I’ve done a 2 hour a day meditation challenge, and it opened my eyes a lot. I have a video abt it on my YT.

And basically that's me being proactive with myself saying every day, I'm actually gonna set aside time, focus on myself and my emotions and make sure I'm good before I go out and grind and do things.

And maybe I sit with myself and realize I need to stop. I need to slow down. I need to take a break.

So guys, I hope you gain some great value from this. And I so enjoyed reading this book and shooting this. So thank you so much for watching guys, peace."
Disordered,"Triggered by ongoing physical illness  
TW 
So I’ve been sick for like a month and half at this point. First 3 weeks of constant excruciating migraines (I have chronic migraine) that that made me throw up multiple times a day. Then I developed severe and near constant vertigo for unknown reasons that also makes me really nauseous and makes keeping food down a challenge at times. I had a UTI at one point, so I could only drink water and couldn’t have sugar. When I stepped on the scale yesterday, I was shocked, confused, terrified…and proud. I’d lost X pounds in a week. More than I can ever remember losing while actively engaging in my eating disorder. Much more than is healthy. I have no appetite and when I eat I get full extremely quickly now, so it shouldn’t surprise me how much I’ve lost. But now I feel the need to lose even more. If I keep losing at the same rate, I could be a weight I’m happy with in two weeks. And it doesn’t even sound out of reach, because I’m still so sick and eating is hard even when I want to. Idk.

Disordered,"2 week eating binge?  2 week binge recovery?

Binge eating for 2 weeks and 20lbs heavier.

I need serious help. This whole summer, i’ve been in a grind and just last week I told myself I would “re-feed” so I didn’t mess up my metabolism. That one weekend turned into a two week binge. I had originally and proudly lost 12lbs and 2% bf. Before I went on my vacation I was sub 140lbs, now I am quite literally weighing in at 163lbs just 14 days later. I am honestly so disappointed in myself right now. Every day I would just eat, eat, eat. I literally could not feel myself getting full. It was like my mouth and stomach were just empty vessels. I can’t even say that I ate until I exploded because at no time during my 2-week binge did I feel overfilled. It’s like my mental signal to stop eating is just broken. How long will it take to get back to my previous weight? How do I lose the pounds quickly"
Disordered,"first post but i just realized something.....  so i used to be anorexic for like ~2 years straight right? right. anyway. last year i realized that my health was getting really bad and my body just looked weird to me so i started trying to recover. my way of recovering was to force myself to eat even if i'm not hungry bc i could easily go a full day without feeling hungry and possibly even two but obviously i needed to eat. well that really back fired on me. i gained back the weight i lost which was my goal and i was really proud of myself BUT now i just have another eating disorder. i just binge eat. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. like i don't ever feel hungry anymore bc i just eat so much. i get bored? i eat. i'm watching tv? i eat. not even hungry in the slightest? i eat. not doing anything with my hands? i eat. maybe some of it is bc of my adhd and always needing to be doing something but idk. it's not small amounts either like i'll eat a whole ass bag of chips in ONE sitting. even the family size. or i'll eat a pound of rice in one sitting.(did that earlier yesterday) i just now realized that i am doing that and maybe it's like a replacement to sh??? i haven't cut in several months. at least 6. idk what to do to fix this. my solution is to just become anorexic again but the ""good and healthy kind"" where you work out a lot but that's not a solution and i hate working out. plus there is no such thing as a ""good"" ed. it's all bad. i also realized that binge eating and having an addiction to eating triggers the same area in the brain as a drug addiction. always told myself i never get addicted to anything. kinda funny. got addicted to sh AND food. this is bad. ig i just need advice on how to fix this bc ik once i get out of the habit of eating every hour and eating a shit ton of food at once i won't do it anymore but like i don't wanna develop another addiction in the process like chewing gum constantly. that's been an idea i've had but i feel like it'd end the same way as this has. idk. i just do everything wrong and it cause more issues. as is evident. sry if this doesn't make sense i was kinda just typing whatever came to my mind. also this was copied from a post i made in the sh subreddits bc it kinda had to do with my sh i just deleted some things and re worded some other stuff but idk. no one there could really help me. now today i only ate some nuggets when i just woke up which was almost 12 hours ago and i refuse to eat anything bc i don't believe that i'm actually hungry. i feel like it's my brain trying to trick me into eating when i don't need to ya know. bc it's so used to eating all the fucking time now. i feel like i'll be stuck in this cycle forever. going between anorexia and binge eating. i hate this...... also sorry if i used the wrong flair i'm not very smart and don't know any ed terms or acronyms yet. kinda been in denial ab having an ed for years :/

edit: k then. over 500 people saw this and no one decided to help me lmfao. i get ignored in every subreddit man. maybe i'm just making up the who ed thing. clearly this isn't an issue if everyone ignores it. i'm upset that i wasted so much time typing this 💀"

Disordered,"ED/picky eater?  Hi everyone.

For years now I’ve (26f) had difficulty eating things I’m not in the mood for. I frequently skip dinners my husband makes because it’s not what I want at the moment and the thought of eating it is repulsive. They’re not even meals that are different from what I normally eat. I also have problems with food I take to work. For example, yesterday I made a turkey sandwich for lunch. I took one bite, realized I was not in the mood for it and had such a difficult time getting the food down. I had to force myself to chew and swallow it and it was so unsatisfying. In my head I felt like I was eating gray sludge. I couldn’t even finish it because of how much I wasn’t in the mood and I’d rather just not eat than put it in my mouth again. Now last week, I ate like 4 turkey sandwiches because I was craving them and didn’t have any problems. I also have problems with textures and very flavorful meals but that’s typically an issue with unfamiliar foods.

Does anyone else experience this? I feel bad for wasting food that’s made but it’s just unbearable to eat things that I’m not craving right at that moment. I had a referral sent to the psychiatrist but haven’t had anyone reach out. Last time I spoke to them 3 weeks ago, they said the next opening was in September. I don’t even know if this is an ED if I’m just picky and if they can even help with it. I am overweight so I’m definitely getting enough food. I’m just frustrated with it all.

Disordered,"Becoming concerned with my husband's body image issues and it's starting to affect my own self image.  Hi there. So I'm (28F) just looking for some advice I guess regarding my husband (30M) and his body image issues. He suffers very much with his perception of himself to the point that I am sometimes concerned and honestly I'm reaching a point where I am burned out and exasperated with talking about it. I try to be understanding and reassuring to him. He has a very abusive father who he is permanently NC with now for over a year. His father spent basically his whole childhood berating DH for his weight. He was a chubby kid and loved food, but they did nothing to help him. They filled the house with junk food and soda and then berated him, a young child, for taking it. My heart bleeds for him when he tells me the things his father would say to him about his weight (just straight up bullying) and the things he would do to shame him for it.

When he was a teenager, he started losing weight because of something his father said to him that was so hurtful that he says his mind blocked it out and he can't remember exactly what it was. His weight has fluctuated a bit over the years but he's always been a fairly normal, healthy weight. When we met, he was very fit as he was working out a lot and doing keto.

He's gained a bit since then, but still looks great; just a little extra. I'm a little chubby myself so I don't care at all. I'm bigger than him, I feel. He, however, is distraught about it all the time. He's tried doing keto again multiple times, but always falls off the wagon because it's honestly just not that doable anymore for him; it impacts our social life and our ability to go out and do fun things together.

I've urged him to instead focus on a balanced diet and he agrees, but any time he lets himself have one thing that's not diet-friendly, he obsesses over it for days after. He stares at himself in the mirror and grabs at his stomach, turns to the side and sucks in until he looks concave, etc. It worries me a lot. If I wasn't with him almost all the time, I would really worry about him skipping meals.

My issue now is that I cannot keep reassuring him multiple times a day. It's starting to negatively affect my own self image and I'm starting to obsess too. I can't handle him saying ""I'm so fat"" and telling him ""You look fine, I like how you look"" twenty times a day. Sometimes he even gets annoyed with me for disagreeing, so I don't know what to say. He sees a therapist for other things, and I have been begging him for ages to talk to her honestly about the body image issues, which he acknowledges are a problem, but he won't do it. He thinks if he accepts himself how he is, he won't care about how he looks and he'll get fat, and I don't know how to explain to him that that's not how that works.

I'm really at the end of my rope with the endless conversations about his weight but I don't know how to say this to him. I'm so frustrated and sometimes I feel he can tell how tired I am of the conversation. I don't want to hurt him or make him feel like I'm not there for him, but there's nothing more I feel I can do and it's really starting to get into my head and I'm feeling bad about my own body. I don't know what to do. Any advice?"

I live with my mum and her bf, her bf is the main source of my social anxiety because he'd call me name behind my back and during their fights. He makes me afraid of even going downstairs because I'm afraid he'll call me fat. So with that I started starving myself and barely eating. From May to Now I've went from 240lbs to now 226lbs. Hell even lately I've been more concerned about my weight, isolating myself and barely eating because of it. I'm afraid of eating  in front of people and often just eat food in my room. These past years I've developed a goal weight for myself which was 90lbs even though i'm 5'8 and have posted on reddits and people have suggested I might have an eating disorder. I've always worn loose clothing and hated my body but lately just seems like it's getting worse. Some days I'd rather not eat because of how much of a pig I am, afraid to meet people because of how fat I am.

Disordered,"I guess I'm confused: Bouncing between one one disorder to something different?  Most of my life, really middle school through adulthood (I'm 22), I've gone through substantial periods of binging and purging, along with constant various other mental disorders. Obviously not great, but it's been manageable. For the past couple weeks I've gone from that to not being able to really eat at all, going from two meals a day to one if I'm feeling okay, sometimes it's really only a snack and that's all I eat. I've been stuck only being able to eat ""childish"" food (corn dogs, chicken nuggets, Mac and cheese) and things like cookies and candy because it's the only thing my body will take. Sometimes I can't even eat that, as I'll take a bite of something and immediately feel nauseous. I don't know if it's just non motivation to eat or if my body is just doing a hahaha and shutting down on me. I haven't changed my meds lately, so I'm not sure what's causing this. So I guess my question is, is this a morph from one disorder to another or something else entirely in your opinion."
Disordered,"TW: Reaching out for help when you’re at a ‘normal’ weight?  Not sure if this is allowed.

I understand that wanting to get better will take a lot of work on my part, but i feel desperate and don’t want to just refer myself to sone therapist or counselling or something that will take a long time to have any effect. It feels like I can’t win with myself, because I am looking for a quick fix for something that no quick fix exists for. I am also scared that if I seek help, it will be more negative than positive."
Disordered,"Do I have an eating disorder? If so, what kind of disorder do I have?  Starting off, for a while I have felt like something is off with my relationship with food. I know something is wrong, I just don't have a label to describe it. I want some sort of label so I can at least have a word to
describe what I am going through. Currently, I am unable to get a professional dx, yet I'm starting to see a counselor for the first time September. I'm not sure if I'll feel comfortable telling them right away, or at all. And if I do, I would like some word or at least an idea of what to say when I bring it up. That is why I'm turning to asking Reddit. 

 When I was a young kid, I did not like eating at all. My parents were always having to force feed me themselves, because I would never willingly eat a full plate on my own. I would do thing such as hide my food in a napkin, bribe my siblings to eat it for me, hold it in my cheeks and spit it out in the toilet, or hide my food in the trash. And if I did eat anything, it would take me at least an hour to finish a plate. My doctor was concerned about me being underweight too. 

Ive felt negative about eating for a while now too. The process of digestion grosses me out, and the idea of chewing, swallowing, and having your food come out of you has always made me uncomfortable. But I would eat food if I had to, because in my culture, where I'm from, refusing food when it's offered to you can be seen as offensive and rude. 

Then, during January I went through a depressive episode. I stayed in my bed, and didn't shower, change
my clothes, or even my bedsheets after my dog had peed on them. It was gross. During that time, I barely ate at all. The most I would eat per day is 5 spoons of food if I could handle it. I lost a lot of weight, weighing between 70-80 pounds at the time. 

Then, when I got out of that state, I started eating a lot. I'd eat a lot of food in one sitting til where I felt uncomfortable. I felt gross the whole time while eating, but I wasn't able to stop myself. Then, I'd try to make up for it by not eating at all for at least 24 hrs, or by making myself throw up. But my gag reflex is practically nonexistent, and it took a lot to make myself throw up
to where my throat would be really sore after so l don't like doing it that much. It feels like an endless cycle of me eating, then my stomach hurts and I feel bad
because I ate, and then I don't eat, and then my stomach hurts because I didn't eat and I can't stop myself from eating again. And i hate it because I wish I didn't even have to eat food in the first place. I don't know what kind of eating disorder any of this translates into, but if anyone does, please let me know"

Hi guys. I never talked about this but I'm desperate for help now. I'm 25/f and my ED started when I was 14. I never got help, never reached out because I never felt that I met the criteria iykyk. At 19 I ""decided"" to recover but I was lying to myself and kept going until I was 24 when I suddenly lost control and just couldn't do it anymore. I suddenly started enjoying food so much and ended up gaining weight rapidly. A lot of weight very fast.
It took a while but I ended up accepting myself and mentally got much better than when I was struggling. Weirdly it was easier to accept myself this way. I truly became a happier person.
The problem is that now I'm very clearly overweight and people notice it. Their comments hurt so much that these last few weeks I began obsessing the same way I used to back then. People say ""OP you were so much prettier when you were skinny stop gaining weight!"" That just hurts so much. And it gets to me everytime! I gain some confidence back and it's gone the moment they say something like this. These last weeks I had this temptations to start again but deep down I know I can't anymore because my body has had enough torture. I also know that I don't want to stay like this forever but part of me feels like I'll never be normal again.
I can try dieting but it will either trigger the ED or I just won't follow though because I'll feel ""trapped"" again. Maybe there's a possibility that someone else went trough this? Is there hope? Is this just a phase?

Disordered,"My triggers make me feel selfish, need advice  First of all i've been struggling with eating disorders since i was in middle school. I have never been diagnosed because I avoid the subject with doctors/therapists and it scares me to tell someone. 

Two years ago (when I was 14) I reached my lowest weight but managed to recover partially over time with the help of my antidepressants. I relapsed recently, in april 2022. 

My triggers are mostly things like comments about my weight or appearance, or comments about my eating habits.   However, I also get triggered a lot by other people's eating habits. I have a great sense of observation and I get scared and jealous when people eat less than me. I know it is immature and petty but I am trying to overcome it, which leads me to the important point of this post: 

I have noticed that my friend has developped and eating disorded a short time after my relapse. (I wont get into details but i am certain she has one, more precisely anorexia) 
I am usually always there for my friends and I always want to help them when I notice something is wrong. Usually I would have asked her what is going on in case she wants to talk about it, but i can't bring myself to do it because if she admits to having an ed it will:

1) make me wanna help her but how can i help if i have the same problem? 
2) If i do help her I would have to recover too and i dont want to
3) if she admits to having an ed i know i will see it as competiton and mine will get worse
4) she may be triggered by me bringing up the subject

So im in this mindset where if I do nothing I'm a bad selfish friend, and if i do someting i'm hypocritical (not following my own advices) and also a bad friend (by maybe triggering  her). Idk what to do


I feel even more selfish because I want her to recover not only for her wellbeing, but also because if she eats normally then I can stop comparing myself to her. 
I feel like a really bad person. 

Please give me some advices or just what you think about the situation. Thank you for reading until the end"

I just joined this group because last year I had some disordered eating crop up out of the blue after 15 years of dormancy.

I used to restrict when I was like 15/16 and then I started abusing substances which kinda killed two birds with one stone. Bc drugs made me skinny and less hungry and helped me to numb my feelings. I stopped obsessing about food and body weight eventually 

I’ve now been sober 9 years and no major food/body image issues. Last summer I had some major life changes and life kinda spiraled out of control. I lost a bunch of weight bc of anxiety n depression and then I became obsessed this last year with keeping the weight off.

I’ve put on some weight and I’m trying to be happy about it because I know I’m healthier now, but I’m constantly battling the desire to restrict with the healthy part telling me to give my body nutrition. the really annoying part is the near constant dialogue about my looks my aging and if I look fat and what’s the right weight to be.

But I did expect some kind of care from all the family members who knew and still know that I struggle.  Nothing big, just a ""how are you?"" once in a blue moon.  That is honestly where I have capped my expectations. But every single one of them has disappeared.  My best friend checked out.  God has left me.  Nobody even knows I exist.  I don't know how to be lonely in this ED.  Why on earth would I leave behind the one thing that has seen me through my worst days now?  I have no motivation to change and no reason to keep fighting.  My logical brain says ""don't listen to the ED, it lies, people do give a sht"".  But evidence doesn't tell lies, and the evidence is in the absence of quite literally every person who ever gave a damn about me.  Why am I to believe I'm worthy of anything when I'm not even worth a 10 second text.  I don't know for how much longer I am willing to carry on this way (no, I promise that is not a cry for help, I am safe, I am simply dumbfounded by this reality), so I need to find some kind of inherent worth within myself, a self with whom I do not identify, or become a careless btch and go about my life as if I don't matter, so what I do doesn't really matter, either.  There is a lightness that comes with the realization that no one cares...like a freedom I guess...but it's still frightening to know that I am sailing this storm alone without anybody to love me."

background: i've kinda always had issues with my body? i mean im sure everyone does but i was a pretty chubby kid and as i went into ms/hs i kinda lost the weight and now im actually underweight to the point where my doctors are making me gain (but i didn't lose out of my deliberate efforts or anything idek)

i don't think i have an eating disorder but i dont think i have the best relationship with food. like i definitely have periods where im calorie counting, i occasionally make myself not eat a lot for meals and i try not to snack much (obv i fail) but it's just. so tiring sometimes. but usually i eat enough.

and sometimes i just hate myself so much over it. just like *stop eating. stop.* i went to a friends house and we made smores and i had four and a half. and my friend something like ""yeah usually people only eat one"". and i can't stop thinking about it. do people think i eat too much? are people watching me and thinking about how much im eating? why can't i just fucking *stop eating so much*. and my parents always say something every time i eat smt with sugar. i put jam in some yogurt i was eating, someone had smt to say. 

and it sucks yk? it's so hard living in a society where everything is j skinnyskinnyskinny. it's so hard hating my body for so long and actually getting to a point where i like my body only for my doctor to force me to gain ten pounds. it sucks feeling like my body is being taken away from me, i don't want to gain weight, part of me doesn't care that i've never properly had a period because i'm underweight.

but the other part of me is justifying every single little thing i want to eat with ""it's fine, you have to gain weight anyways!"" and then i realized that i'm not actually indulging because i want to gain weight, it's just the same little voice that kept me eating and eating and eating before this whole being-forced-to-gain-weight thing.

i had a friend basically tell me ""you don't look that underweight you look fine"" and i wanted to scream. because if im not even skinny now i'm going to hate what i look like after this. why can't you just see?   
why can't you see that i can be skinny and be so scared of gaining weight? why can't you see that it's more about it being good for me and shit, it's about dismantling this entire view i have towards food. im here looking at the scale with dread if i go up or go down. 

why can't i just have some self fucking control. why can't i just be at a healthy weight and be skinny at the same time. i hate walking through hallways and looking at everyone's perfect fucking bodies and hating mine and my stupid ugly face."

Okay so, my brother and I made cupcakes. they were pretty average cupcakes red velvet with cream frosting, after we made them we put them in the fridge. after an hr or so I went to the fridge and ate one singular cupcake (it was around 6pm) my father saw and went berserk. He started yelling and screaming at me calling me fat and a pig for the way I looked. he started making me feel shit about my body. (im quite muscular and definite muscular features however I do have fat and quite big tits making my body look presumably fatter. Im also a 16 yr old girl.) I genuinely felt like crying. I didn't know what I did wrong. weight and my body is something that I've been hating myself for a very long time, around the age of 10.

My body hasn't always been this big, it got worse after my uncles death around that age, and I found food an away to cope with my feeling. But my parents never liked it and always constantly belted me for it, even going far as to point it out at party and family gatherings. (But I genuinely love my parents but stuff like this hurts).

But todays incident really hit a cord of mine as my father grabbed my shirt and dragged me to the weight machine telling me to weigh myself. after he saw my weight he screamed more and told me to loose 10 kg by the end of this month, he even went far as saying he wouldn't mind me getting a eating disorder out of it.

I'm at a place that I don't know what to do. im upset by my body and that I cant look like other models and even after doing workouts and all these diets my actual fat on my body won't reduce and if it did it creates overneeded muscle that im not looking for.

I occasionally try to loosen my restriction when i am in a happy place mentally. whenever I try to do this, though, i go straight into “survival eating” mode. just, inhaling food until it hurts. Normal adult human amounts of food hurt, the pain of eating even more than that is something else entirely. I want to seize the opportunity to give my body nutrients and a rest from the constant stress of starving. But the way it hurts I can’t imagine I’m healing at all. It’s gotten a little better, it’s been five days, today i ate a normal dinner without having to buckle over in pain for an hour. And for what it’s worth, i do try to give my body things it really needs, not just processed junk food. (Restriction me lives off rice krispies). Also i’m poopin again, which is cool :P

I not sure where to put this but I'm sure someone here will understand. 

I gained quite a bit of weight because my depression and anxiety pretty much locked me in my house. I didn't move or do anything but watch TV for 7 months. The whole time I was worried my bf wouldn't love me because I thought I was ""fat"". At the time he was in a bad way and said he'd leave if I was fat with no reference as to what that meant. (We've since then recovered and developed knowledge and understanding of what that caused and how to move forward). Besides trying to unalive myself this had been the longest, hardest, most mentally exhausting existence I'd ever had.

Over this time my ARFID got really bad and I was only eating 5 or 6 things. None of which had high value.  Over time I was able to adjust it a bit. I've added fruits and veggies. A few types of meats and ensures to assist.

Now that I'm doing much better but still not eating much I've lost all the weight and then some. I haven't weighed this much since I was 20 (now 25) and worked 2 jobs and went to the gym for 4 hours a day. I'm slowly going under my lowest weight ever as an adult. That scares the heck out of me but part of me wants it to keep going. Even though I'm not actively doing anything to cause this. 

I know it's the ED talking but I looked in the mirror and got so excited that my stomach was flat (my biggest insecurity and showed worse with more weight) I feel a lot of things about this. I was excited I ""look thin"" but also guilty that it's the ED that made me like this. I wish it was healthy but I was so excited. I see it all over my body where I've lost muscle mass and feel it during my activities but I'm partly just glad I'm finally ""thin"" without trying for the first time ever. I feel shame and disgust as this is not healthy and I know better.

Hello I am 24(M) and looking for some advice because I really don’t know where else to go. I recently had a major mental breakdown after a year of over excersizing and under eating. I was counting calories and eating  a significantly low amount of calories for about six months and started to slowly increase my calories but I fear I was too late. After one year of under eating, intense weight lifting and working out for six days a week for two plus hours I started to have severe fatigue, anxiety and panic attacks and body aches. I lost a significant amount of weight but according to the bmi scale I am considered a healthy weight. I did blood work and realized my body was in starvation mode and my testosterone had dropped to ninety eight (the amount of a seventy year old man). I am now on antidepressants, anxiety medications and have gotten testosterone pellets. It has been two months since I have worked out and my body is always aching and burning. I thought that once I stopped the working out that this would get better but it hasn’t. I’m thinking that I wasn’t getting enough nutrients to repair my muscles and now they are permanently damaged. I am so scared because I feel like I have ruined my life and will always be having this muscle pain. The doctors I have gone to don’t think anything of it and I hate taking so many medications because before I messed my life up I didn’t take any. Has anyone gone through this and maybe understand what I’m talking about in regards to the muscle pain? It’s so frustrating too because the doctors will congratulate me on my weight loss, but the amount of weight I lost in eight months was not healthy. 😩"

Disordered,"relapsed after 10+ years  I developed an eating disorder when I was around 13 years old. It went on through age 19 or so. I wouldn't eat much and I became obsessed with working out. Which cause what I wanted, i was thin. In my 20s i learned about nutrition and proper excercise and eventually had a much better relationship with food and my body. 

Fast forward to now, I'm a mom of 2. In my 30s and the weight has been packing on and staying on for the last 4 years. I've tried to go the healthy route so many times. Nothing worked. I started doing IF. 16:8 mostly and it was helping, slowly. But I felt good. In the last two months, my life has been extremely hard, I've fallen hard into depression and my anxiety has been so bad to the point where I couldn't physically eat or keep anything down. I lost 8lbs in one week. That's where my relapse happened. The rapid weight loss was so satisfying. I havent been able to get myself to eat normally again. I stay hydrated by drinking a gallon of water a day. I eat one meal(dinner) a day. On the weekends, because my husband is home, I do eat a little more to hide my relapse. Sometimes I allow myself to binge and take laxatives the next day to ""clear it out""  I'm aware that what I'm doing is not healthy, not for me or my family. But i seem to not have much control over it. I'm down 14lbs now and it feels good to have lost the weight but not good that I'm treating my body this way. I have it in my mind that once I reach my goal weight, I'll be able to stop and get back to my healthy relationship with food and exercise.

This relapse feels much worse though.
I’m currently in the middle of doing my A levels, a close friend has passed away and I haven’t eaten anything except cheese and bread for about a week. I’m sure my appetite has just decreased due to stress, so I was trying to cope with it by just eating a cheese sandwich when I could and otherwise not focusing too much on food, but this is horribly similar to when I first developed anorexia which was due to appetite loss from stress caused by my teacher bullying me. The triggering point back then was that I had to do a project on eating disorders, and this made anorexia just click in my head. This time round my grandma has just told me that its a good thing that I can’t eat and that I’m losing weight, and now I can feel the eating disorder really coming back strong. I feel so guilty about food and eating and weight now.
I don’t want this in my life again. It makes me so unbearably miserable, but I feel so powerless against it. I just don’t know what to do or how to fight this anymore.

Disordered,"Why is my eating so weird?  TW: General discussion of different eating ‘approaches’? Not sure what the word is for that

First things first, I don’t have an eating disorder. However my eating is really strange, for several reasons, and I was wondering if anyone knows what this is/what I can do:

- On my way to/from school, I find it really difficult not to buy sweets/chocolate. This has been going on for years now, and the idea of buying or eating sweets always makes me feel sick, however I find it so hard not to buy and eat a bunch of sweets.

- This is similar at home; if I have access to sweets I desperately don’t want to eat them but I feel like I can’t not. It’s weird.

- Additionally, I’ve always been a super picky eater; I don’t like ham, cheese, most cold food, bread that has stuff with it or isn’t toasted, salad, etc.

- This means that the idea of a lot of different meals makes me feel sick. However this has begun to spread to most of my favourite foods, including my comfort food.

- I’ve never thought I had a bad relationship with food, and I’m very active and I don’t feel insecure about my body. My only issue is that I’m worried for my teeth, as I find it difficult to brush them often so I don’t want sugar to ruin them.

Disordered,"Scared of certain foods, feeling hungry and ""getting better""  TW: Health anxiety.

I feel so scared and out of control. After going ""keto"" and restricting a lot of certain foods, I can't seem to go back from it. I feel so brainwashed or controlled, like someone is watching me eat and critizing me for eating a slice of carrot all day, everyday.

I have insulin resistance which is what made me so obsessed with ""healthy foods/diet"" and it terrifies  me to eat outside of my safe foods because I'm constantly anxious about making the condition worse or getting myself sick or whatever. It's like I have to pick one: either keep restricting and not have insulin issues or don't restrict and have insulin issues. I hate it, hate it so much. I can't go out, I can never enjoy life anymore, everything is food, how many carbs, how much protein, I need to exercise or I'll die mentality. I hate exercise.

I am so tired, I've lost so much weight and trying to gain some back has been hard, stressful and isolating. I just don't know what to do anymore."
Disordered,"Am I faking it?  TW: numbers

I’ve been dealing with fucked up eating patterns for a little over a year. I went from 245 lbs to (about) 115 lbs just from restricting, and recently i’ve started working out a lot to go along with this. I’m absolutely terrified of eating because I always think i’ll gain weight from it, constantly count calories, etc. I eat sometimes, however, especially when my parents force me to… does that mean i’m faking it? I feel like i’m not really sick the moment I slip and eat something"
Disordered,"TW? Acid Reflux & Lapsing  Hi y’all. This is my first post here, so, here are the basics:
I’m 24yo (25 in Sep), Female.

I’ve struggled with anorexia for nearly 10 years, but have been (mostly) working towards recovery for the last 4 years or so. It’s been at a snails pace, and mostly a solo journey (I do try online therapy sometimes, when it’s really bad, or when I can afford it)…

That said, I’ve never managed to reach or maintain a healthy weight. So when I do lapse- or occasionally full on relapse- the side affects tend to hit pretty quick ((I think my body’s getting sick of my sh*t, quite frankly. And I don’t blame it 😅)).

I’ve recently moved, and hadn’t even noticed myself slipping until I stepped on the scale last week for the first time in months (I try to avoid it bc it’s a huge trigger for me). I’ve been trying to eat more the last few days, but know it’s not nearly enough.

And so, now I’m dealing with horrible, almost non-stop acid reflux, and nausea.
I eat? Nauseous.
Don’t eat? Nauseous.

I can’t seem to win here, or make it go away.
I’ve been chewing tums, putting baking soda in water, drinking warm water (sometimes with honey)— all that. 
It only helps for a few minutes or hours tho.

Any advice? 
Other than to “just keep eating,” or to “power through”. I’m doing that- it’s not working.
Thanks!"
Disordered,"TW: Can't stop counting carbs  Since being diagnosed with some health issues, I was adviced to exercise and change my not so great diet to a ""healthier"" one. But things went south really fast. 

Slowly but surely I starting cutting back extremely on carbs, sugar and calories. I was caught by the keto and clean eating culture badly. I've always been small but now I've lost so much weight and muscle mass my doctor is worried. Every time I try to eat outside of my ""rules"" I feel so anxious and guilty, like someone is judging me for eating- I'm not even talking about junk food, but something like a having a slice of mango sends me into a self hate spiral.

I hate this, hate this so much. Food was never a source of worry or stress to me before but now it's all my life is about- it's extremely isolating and depressing and no one seems to understand. I'm told to ""Just eat normally"" but I can't, I'm always counting carbs in my head, even if I'm left hungry I think ""but that's x more carbs, so I shouldn't"". 

I wish I could go back to the times food, eating and living wasn't so hard."

In the last 2 years I've started to wither away. Mentally. Physically. Emotionally. 

My ARFID has gotten so bad I've lost 25 lbs. At my absolute healthiest, I had to workout 4 hours a day, 6 days a week and be strict on food to be a few pounds more than I am right now. I'm concerned as the scale keeps dropping every time I check. (Which is not often out of fear of starting other ED behavior) 

So far I've increased snacks, and made sure to pour more than I usually would for my usual breakfast cereal meal in the mornings. 

I include fruits and very few veggies, and only eat chicken thighs. 

none of my safe foods are over processed or frozen which seems to be a common occurrence in this community. 

I've cut out all sweets because of emetephobia.

It's extremely hard to eat new foods as my stomach hurts constantly. My emetephobia keeps me from most of them.

So theoretically, say I’ve been at 500-600 cal a day (don’t come at me I’m in the admissions process for res) and I usually break that up into separate 150-200 calorie “meals”. But tonight, I had an additional 300 calories at once, which is way more than I have at one time. It also was a super high volume of food (you can eat a t o n of baby food and fruit for just a few hundred calories). Obviously it’s really stupid to ask if 300 calories counts as a binge but to me it 100% feels like I binged, I had a super high volume of food, more calories than I typically eat at once, in addition to the food I normally eat in a day, late at night, and I’m full now. 
I feel like that absolutely constitutes as a binge. 
But I also did it because I woke up hungry in the middle of the night, not just to eat. I’ve never really binged before, idk if this is something I need to bring up to therapist/dietician or if my thinking is just especially disordered right now."

it’s okay.

i fully recognize that recovery is not linear. there will be rough days, good days, and days where i relapse. it’s a long journey.

here’s how i deal whenever i relapse:
i curl up in bed and allow myself to feel the guilt and shame associated with it.

then i get up, take a shower, and cleanse myself of those feelings.

Truthfully, I am pretty conventionally skinny (although I think I could be a lot more healthy. I know healthy and skinny are not equivalent. I need to eat better, work out more.) but I want to lose a bit more weight just to lose the belly pouch, arm flab, muffin top -- just the minor things. So I go on these stints of not eating for as long as I possibly can and of course I always end up failing and eating out one night, after which I feel so incredibly ashamed, angry and guilty the day after. During this past summer I managed to lose a bunch of weight and received so many comments about it. My parents were concerned but obviously parents are just overbearing. Honestly I loved all the comments from others about how nice I look. I was so proud of myself but I'm mad that I don't have the discipline to starve more or even be able to do it again to the same degree as last year. I lie to people that I workout more than I do and eat healthy but really I'm just starving myself. As a medical student, I find it convenient too because then I don't have to take food breaks during my day. I feel so annoyed that I can't go back to my consistency from last summer that I've even started thinking about making myself throw up. But I haven't yet and don't really want to go to that point, but every time I end up eating I get more tempted to think about it.

Disordered,"Eating Disorder Treatment and Treatment Fatigue?  TW:ED + Treatment+ Weight gain+ Weight Loss+ B.E+ A.N

I have been struggling with an ED for over four years now,

I had hidden it really well for a while I guess, but my mom had suspected about two years back. She hadn't done anything about it at the time and then back in October signed me up for a PHP program that ended up not being about EDs but about mental health. (Which I have also been severely struggling with) They ended up doing nothing, just letting me sleep the entire time, and not doing anything for my mental health. We had an intake with The Emily Program in which they ended up telling me I was in critical condition and had to move to residential treatment. They never told us when but there was quite a waiting list. My intake was probably in November. My brother ended up coming home from the military sometime in December. (For some quick background, he and I were super close at the time.) I had just gotten over COVID so they weren't requiring me to get tested before I went in because it was within 90 days. I was ALSO just getting into a very new relationship in December. I was at my now boyfriend's house when I got multiple calls from my mom. I had called her back and that's when she told me that I had less than three days before I had to leave. You can imagine my surprise, especially because they told me they would give me a week's notice.

He and I spent every moment from that call to the day I left together. Extending our curfews and did everything we could to get just a little bit more time. I had left for residential on the 28th of December in 2021. They told me 30 days. Then later I find out that my discharge ended up being on the 26th of March...

I also have something called ""Oral Allergy Syndrome""- Pretty much means I will react to certain fruits and vegetables but only sometimes based on when they were pollinated.

My first problem being there was, that anytime I would react to a food, I would get a response from someone saying, ""Challenge it. It's just your eating disorder."" Which is absolutely absurd, it was in my chart, and it was very evident that I was having an allergic reaction. My mother had to call in repeatedly to tell them to which they'd say ""Well she needs to get diagnosed.""- I HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED FOR YEARS.

My second problem came from my dietitian. She had given me my goal weight, and though I have an eating disorder, with a jaded sense of normal when it comes to weight, it seemed abnormally high. I had expressed my concerns to my mom once again to which she was shocked. Because my dietitian told her a completely different number. I was livid. My dietitian informed me about how they decide the goal weight. They look at growth charts and fine your ""natural arch"" from before the eating disorder had started. she had told me that my goal weight was in the 80th percentile, but the weight she told my mom was in the 60th. My mom is also in the medical field. And then sent me my growth charts. I had struggled with eating before I was struggling with anorexia. I had a step-dad with binge eating. We kept tons of junk food in the house, and I was gaining too much weight while I was in early middle school. I was developing an addiction to sugar... To which the same dietitian told me ""You can't be addicted to sugar."" But that dietitian refused to believe that my eating habits back then were unhealthy. I have had countless doctors try to put me on diets because of my rapid weight gain back then. So my ""Natural Body Arch"" was inaccurate. Before ALL my unhealthy eating habits, I was naturally in the 50th percentile for weight. But that's where I was when I went into the hospital because I gained weight before I left knowing it would help me get out faster. Understandably so, she didn't want me leaving the same weight I went in. But she refused to accept the fact that it was where I was supposed to be. So she forced me to gain too much weight. (I am also pretty short because I started restricting at the same time I was supposed to be growing. So I am at a whopping five foot one inch.) They ended up discharging me a month early because my mom and I ended up calling the insurance company to explain what the dietitian was telling us. The ED Specialist at our insurance was on our side and agreed to stop insurance coverage so I could get out.

My mental health was going to HELL, while in res. I was mentally worse in there than I was before going in. But they told me ""Your physical health needs to be fixed before you focus on your mental health"" It was driving me crazy. I simply just wasn't allowed to be depressed there. So I got out and was signed up for IDP.

Which I started a couple of days after leaving residential. Which then, was 35 hours a week. From 12-7 Mon-Fri. That was even more mentally draining than residential. It prevented me from going to school, going to work (And getting money... I may be 17 but I have bills I need to pay. My parents don't pay for everything), and having relationships with friends and my boyfriend. I had countless panic attacks from being there. That was about two months and I had my step down a couple of days ago to IOP.

IOP is now 4-7 Mon-Thurs. A LOT less. But I am so tired of treatment. I've been in these treatments since October. I am a Junior in high school and it is seriously starting to affect my grades. I had to drop all my classes except two. The entire time I was in res, I did no school. And now I am at risk of not graduating.

So, this current treatment I am in has a mandatory community meeting on Tuesdays. In which, my parents are supposed to join from 5-7. Mine can't. First of all, my bio parents are divorced and I am not close with my stepfather or stepmother at ALL. My mom works during that time from home, and my stepdad is asleep due to his work hours as well. Because of that, they asked if I had any older siblings available to fill in. One is in the military, one is a state away(Along with my bio father and stepmom), and the last is due in a couple of weeks to deliver her baby. So no. I don't have anyone to ""Fill in"" for my parents. At that point, they told my mom ""We might have to discharge her if there is nobody that can support her."" But at the same time, they keep telling my mom how important IOP is for my recovery. As I was sitting in the meeting last night they had asked me if my BOYFRIEND could fill in. And be in the meetings that my PARENTS are supposed to be in. Oh my God. I love him, so much. And he has been extremely supportive and understanding of my recovery. But I don't feel comfortable relying on him once again for this. And my parents agree.

My biggest problem with these treatments is that I feel like it isn't helping my eating disorder. Now I'm not saying it hasn't I feel like it's just making me so depressed, unmotivated, and mentally drained that I don't have the energy to keep trying to have an eating disorder. This is all absolutely crazy. It's driving me crazy too.

Okay story time. I went out to a restaurant this afternoon, I came for a spicy wings challenge but decided I wanted a little bit of mac n cheese too, the mac n cheese ended up being too many calories total, which was fine because I only wanted to have a little bit and shared the rest with my parents while trying some of what they ordered with it. I had some of the mac n cheese but it was not what I hoped it would be, and my parents ordered some bland fried food (basically nuggets and dip), which I tried a little but didn't really want to eat. Now we are waiting for the challenge, 75% of my mac n cheese is sitting there bothering me while my parents slowly eat their 1200+ cal meals. The challenge comes along, it's not even that challenging or spicy, and I finish in almost half the time, because I wanted to leave time to clean off the bones. I'm about to go back and the judge decides that the challenge is complete. even the wings (700 cal) are not really worth the calories to me, I tell myself ""one more bite's a binge"", but when my Dad decided to try the spice, I end up nibbling at the bones too. Then I do it again, and again. After the spicy wings there was an ice cream that came along with the wings. I didn't want the ice cream, I tried to share it with my parents but they wanted me to enjoy it. I should have passed on it altogether, but I was interested in the syrup on top. However, I didn't really like the ice cream and after a few spoonfuls I decided I was satisfied, and my parents took the rest to share while I enjoyed my zero cal drink. But then when my Dad gave the ice cream to my Mom, he decided that I should have her (non zero cal) drink. Sugary drinks, boba tea for example, are a serious trigger for me I'm trying to drink slowly, freaking out that there's no way for me to avoid finishing this thing, meanwhile I'm trying to make the most of it by awkwarly switching between my zero cal drink. I tell Dad to try it too, now it's getting passed around like a fucking hot potato. Eventually, we decide to just leave it, and I'm sipping my drink while waiting for Mom and Dad to finish their food, I take a bit, unsure whether I wanted to or if it was just to be social. I then for some reason took another piece of the one with fewer pieces (more cals a piece). I wiped my face with a napkin in order to discretely spit it out, but I find myself taking yet another piece. Now I'm making small grabs here and there for a spoonful of the mac n cheese, a spoonful of the ice cream, and just switching between everything except the leftover of the wings which is covered in napkins and out of my reach. They got it boxed, I realize I didn't really have to eat any of it. I had brought some snacks in my pocket, I end up having a piece, then decide to chew gum while we're in the car as a coping mechanism. I had recently tried to stop coping using gum. 

We go shopping, I get away from my family to use the restroom. I try and I almost purge. As a little bit comes up I realize that it's only probably 1000 calories or so, maybe 2k at most. I convince myself at the last second it's not worth it, but now I know how. 

We stop at the neighbors house to tell them about the challenge. Their mom offers us some apple pie, one slice for me one slice for my parents to share. I say that it's too much for me and she puts half of the slice back. It still feels like too much. I tilt my plate, pretend to finish sweep the crumbs up with my fork, as I get up to discretely throw the remaining pie in the garbage. Conversation goes on, they offer us some of a chicken dish. I take as little rice as possible because I wanted to try it, and two pieces of chicken. I didn't want to eat another meal, but I wanted to try a little bit and it would have been awkward not to. My hands get messy while eating the food, I grab a napkin and wipe off the sauce to try ans save calories. But I end up grabbing another piece.
There is drink in my pocket, I added the drink mix to my water because I thought it would go well.It did, but by the time I'm done with the chicken, I still have more drink left, I end up taking one more piece of chicken. I end up adding more even more water to the cup so I could sip while we chatted, but I knew that I should have just probably poured it out. I feel distant from the conversation while I sip my drink. 

We all get away from the table to talk outside, but I am super tired, and go back into my house. I should have probably tried to catch a nap but I also had to fold the laundry. But I'm so worried about stopping the binge that I just start chugging salt water, not to purge, I guess to feel full/to cope in order to hold off further overeating. 

This has backfired on me before and it just did again 

I don't need satiety. I just need some hope.

I am now too bloated to sleep (I'll have to use the bathroom) and feeling too sluggish to do laundry and it is too close to dinner time to sleep. 

The one good thing was that there was leftover from the large salad I had before going out (to prepare me for the spicy wings), and I would be able to have that for dinner. But the neighbors gave us some of the apple pie, a different chicken and potato dish, and some bread. I end up wandering to the fridge, stressing about time passing. I know that dinner is going to roll around and I am going to have FOMO. I mindlessly grab some low calorie things out of the fridge, mushrooms and such. And then, as one thing lures me to the next, the spoon comes out, and I start taking bits of the fruit that was for dessert, some salsa, more mushrooms, basically everything in sight that seems low cal enough that I might as well. but that doesn't change the feeling of the calories creeping up. I spit some things out, only to mindlessly reach for even more food, I eventually go to start the dryer, still munching on asparagus, I go to throw it in the trash, still snapping off pieces and eating it as I open the lid. 

I run up to my room to fold the laundry that is laying out while the dryer does the second half of it. Still fighting the urge to back down, I grab 2 altoids. This is usually my go to for stopping a binge, and for the first time ever, I end up reaching for a second pair of altoids. 

I was probably on pace to finish folding the clothes once the dryer finished, but at that point, I just layed face down and started crying. For about 20 minutes. 

Now dinner time has come around. I used to ask to serve myself at dinner, as a way of trying to get all the low calorie food on my plate, but as my appetite has gone down, this has just become a burden. I don't really want to say too much about dinner. I get fomo as usual, they end up making me feel guilty and selfish for the time it takes me to serve myself, because I am fumbling through the cluttered kitchen that I tried to not worry about while they sit already served.

I am selfish because I am desperate. 

Anyways, I have my salad, one bread and a little bit of the chicken potato dish. I end up getting up to grab a few more vegetables from the fridge, but when dessert comes around I have the fruit that was for dessert and pass on the pie. Dad insists on each of us having a slice of the cake we had from earlier in the weekend, and I end the day by swiftly putting it in my pocket and being done after finishing the fruit. 

I have started my fasting window about an hour ago as I finish writing this, I still have to fold the laundry, and I'm super tired.

I often look at these kind of days and wonder if it's my disordered tendencies or if it's really just me. I miss when I saw no distinction/ felt no need for one.

to think that 1 day ago I was close to my LW and physically feeling good without even trying to hard.

For me, after comfortably restricting for a good while, this is just one more reminder to never let myself want something.

tldr: Did a spicy wing challenge, wanted a little mac n cheese for old time sake, got pressured to eat more calories than I wanted to throughout the day. The situation combined with me bingeing on my own terms led to me crying before dinner, then still having a bunch of laundry to fold before bed

This post may look kind of messy and scattered since the app messed up a few times while I was writing.

Anyways, let me know if you have any similar experiences or ways you handle this kind of situation."

Disordered,"Help  I already made a post about my apparent ED and it looks like I'm on the beginning stage, so I haven't actually developed anything yet.


I have a dietitian which I've been seeing for some months. She helps me with guilt when eating, binging due to boredom and all that kinds of stuff. It doesn't feel like it does much for me, since my father is always with me in her appointments and I can't tell her about my ED openly. I've been seeing several posts in social media about that kind of stuff and all sings seem to indicate that I haven't improved. Sure, my eating patterns are slightly better, but my mindset is still the same.


There's also my mother. It looks like she's struggling with an unhealthy relationship with food as well, and she comments on how much weight she's gained or that I shouldn't eat chocolate at night because it'll make me fat, etc. She keeps making those comments quite regularly. I told my dietitian about it without actually revealing her identity, but her tips aren't very helpful when it comes to dealing with my mother's reactions towards my diet.


Between my mother, my dietitian's unhelpful tips, my body image issues and the stuff that's been going on in my life I find myself wishing I could skip breakfast again or work out more to lose weight. I have no one to talk to about this and I feel trapped. What can I do to improve my relationship with food?"
Disordered,"deathbed regrets  Have I just been *""waiting around""* for my eating disorder to change?

being locked in the upstairs of your thoughts, (brain-bound, i call it), gives me a dull headache.

there is an art to waiting around, apparently. a craft. have i perfected that craft?

waiting for change, waiting for movement, waiting for difference.

the definition of insanity is doing something over and over and expecting different results.

all this brain-bound thinking requires mental gymnastics. who is in control of whom? am i in control of my body or is my body in control of me? my thoughts bounce backwards and forwards in my head, twisting into tangents and intrusively pushing forward until i finally take action to simmer the thoughts: throw up on the way home into this white plastic bag, crouched in this dark alley way. well now, what did i expect? i picture someone hitting my nose with a rolled newspaper. bad dog!

i thought once i quit starving i would be happier. i would reach this pinnacle stage of adulthood where happiness resided. i would be able to take a seat in it, relax.

i wring words out of a wet rag and they plunge to the floor. maybe if i pick them up carefully, i could describe what's happening? then i could get out? i could be free? i'm like a dim child, putting squares into circles slots.

anyways, waiting around. i check mirrors for years, the same reflection stares back. i eat burnt toast for years, the same emptiness grows in my chest. i drink diet coke for years, the same satisfaction singes my stomach. maybe this time, this year, this moment, the toast and diet coke will do something different for me? i wait.

maybe if i dress it up a bit (dress up this raging-fire of an eating disorder, lol!): i'll layer my dirty starving habits into my personality, knit my actions into my character, weave my eating disorder into my hair and the men that i fuck, tattoo the feeling from purging into my chest (so it permanently resides, Pandora's box), or maybe allow my body to heal over the pain, scarring my eating disorder into me forever, never leaving. i wait.

the times when my eating disorder has been quiet in my life, it feels like standing in a quiet desert. uninhabited, desolate, wasteland. my hobbies disappear. my personality shrinks. my hair falls out. the only song that plays is ""static"" by godspeed you black emperor! on a deafening loud volume (i double dog dare you to sit in a room quietly and listen to that song in its entirety). i wait in the desert. i wait and wait and wait.

i have not waited around stagnantly, either. i have moved metaphorical furniture for years, making new rooms in my head. i have changed, i have adapted, i have matured, i have seen therapists. and yet, in every version of my new Self, i seem to be waiting around.

maybe if i bleach my insides? strip all the wallpaper, gut my veins. oh, i can smell the sweet smell of sanitary doctor's office now. nice and clean.

here's my secret: when i hear/listen/see young girls (sorry men, can't relate to you as well. no offense) talk about their blooming eating disorder, i want to beat the shit out of them. there they are, just fertilizing their thoughts and tending their depression garden. they're feeding the god-damn thing! they're making a home for it! what! the! fuck!

here's my second secret: i have tended my depression garden for years. i made a fire for it, got it a chair, and made it comfy. i'm projecting my self-inflicted anger onto younger girls. i just don't want you to do the same as me, man.

the real secret of this post: i know when i'm old and on my deathbed, with white porcelain hair and opaque blue eyes, my true regret will flash before me like a series of silent videos. videos of me silently waiting around, doing the same thing over and over.

So I've been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years now, when we started dating she was in a rough spot and undiagnosed with anorexia, a few months into dating her parents sent her to a recovering hospital that focuses on eating disorders. Things happend there that are a whole other topic, however she got back after about a month being there and obviously there was a change in physical appearance by becoming healthier, I stuck with her the entire time and it's been over a year now shes been out. Since she has been out she has still struggled mentally with her disorder but hasn't ever completely relapsed. I'm very proud of her and I dont hold her to any expectation except to keep doing well and trying to help her not hard relapse. The issue I'm struggling with though is ive gained a pretty significant amount of weight since she has gotten back, I'm not saying it's her fault but I do know a part of why that happend is because anytime she would eat or get snacks she would ask me if I wanted some and if I didnt she wouldnt want to be eat it and because of that I didnt want her to not eat so I ended up eating alot more than I normally would snack wise and everything and I have gained about 40-50 pounds over the past year give or take. Again not saying it's her fault but I know it played a role. I've been at a point of wanted to lose that weight back for a few months now I just dont know how to go about it while keeping her in mind because I know it could make her want to work out alot and lose weight as well. Obviously there is nothing wrong with a healthy workout routine but I'm afraid she would go to an extreme like she has before. I want to get back to my healthy athletic weight without making her feel insecure or uncomfortable and I just dont know how to go about that. So if there are any suggestions or anything I'd love the advice. And I hope this was an okay post to make without causing any problems and I'm proud of each and everyone of you :)"

Disordered,"I have ARFID and I'm worried it will soon transition into anorexia soon.  TW: Numbers

I have ARFID which is Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. The texture, smell and taste of most food is repulsive and it keeps me from eating most of the time. It had nothing to do with weight loss at the beginning and I was really scared of how much weight I was losing especially since it was accompanied by a lot of tremors and weakness cause of my low nutrient intake. I've told my mom about this multiple times and she's just been happy that I'm losing weight.

I've been overweight most of my life. She's overweight as well and has serious body image issues that she also projects on to me. She's been calling me fat my entire life while doing nothing to encourage healthy eating or exercise only unhealthy diets.

Now that I've lost about 40lbs in 3 months she finally likes how I look and has been praising my body. Now I'm worried to gain weight again cause I don't want to deal with her comments about my body anymore. My ARFID is triggered by stress caused by school. So once that calms down it might go away. When that happens and I'm eating the amount of calories that I should be I'll probably gain weight again.

I don't know if I will go back to eating a healthy amount of food when most food isn't repulsive anymore. If I gain weight I know my body image issues will get worse.

i feel no guilt. well, i did when getting ready to purge, but during and after i didn't. but i didn't get the high either. 

maybe it's because i barely got anything up. i had just eating 2 large choc chip muffins and all that really came up was the water i drank. i have up bc it was going everywhere and i got so tired. ive had my ed and have been purging for 10 years. i always feel weak after for like an hour. but that was 3-4 hours ago and i can hardly stand bc i have no strength. my chest hurts. i feel like i can't get a deep enough breath. i can't walk even 2 seconds (not exaggerating) without having to stop and bend over to catch my breath. im 99% sure im fine, but there will always be the worry. what if i have heart problems and don't know it and am going to give myself a heart attack? but why isn't that enough to actually stop me? 

im sure it's becoming a regular thing for me again until (tmi?) 5 fingers doesn't even work anymore (why does that always happen? i feel like it's just me). i don't know why i wrote this. i guess because there's no one else to vent to about it and i wanna be told im okay. <3"

Or just basically anyone who can explain what’s going on during my recovery please…  So I’ve decided I wanna try to get on a normal diet and try recovering from my ED (keep in mind: I’ve been eating 800-1000 calories a day) for about like 3 months or so and my health has been really deteriorating because of it. But every time I try to eat normally and start slow by eating 1200-1500 calories per day (that was recommended) I GAIN weight despite LITERALLY EVERYONE around me telling me it’s **physically impossible** to gain weight on 1200-1500 calories a day but somehow I’m doing it?? Idk I guess I’m a fucking prodigy or smth for somehow gaining weight, but this terrifies me into relapsing into my ED again and again. I’m too afraid to eat above my safe amount of calories now (800-1000). Can someone reassure me or something and/or explain to me why tf I’m somehow gaining a pound a day?? Like I heard to gain a pound, you need to eat like 3500 calories above your BMR which is rn to me looking like a load of bullshit. And I get it, my metabolism is probably fked up now but like ???? And pls don’t try to tell me I’m just “miscounting calories” or something bcz I weigh literally **everything** I eat, and I count EVERYTHING oils, spices, even a single carrot and I *overestimate* calories in food to be safe as a habit so I know I ain’t eating more than I am saying…. Does anyone else relate to this?? Please tell me I’m not alone in this. Is this normal?? 

Btw BEFORE anyone says anything like “it’s impossible to live off of 800-1000 calories a day, or you’d be dead by now” fyi, it IS possible to survive off of 800-1000kcals/day but it’s clearly NOT healthy and I KNOW THAT.

Disordered,"Nervous with eating and really struggling, not sure if I have an eating disorder  So I’m not really sure if what I experience is disordered eating or an eating disorder but I already deal with ARFID and I also deal with body image issues and severe anxiety. But anyways my relationship with food is really weird. Cause sometimes I will eat and not really think about anything negative and I’m kind of fine with food. But other times I’ll get nervous eating and I physically won’t be able to eat sometimes and usually with my anxiety that makes it worse. I don’t always actively avoid eating, sometimes I do but not really. I try to make sure I have at least a meal a day if not two (although I don’t eat much because again my anxiety). I’ve been feeling really horrible and depressed lately and my anxiety is through the roof so I’m having trouble eating. On top of my body issues I find myself thinking how I’m afraid of eating more than one meal a day because what if I gain weight (I’m of a healthy weight as of rn but I’m not in shape so I have a stomach and I’m embarrassed by it). I’m also afraid of exercising because what if that just makes all of this worse. My mom I think suffers from disordered eating or maybe even an eating disorder. She has a bad relationship with food. My sister had one too. And also recently my friend’s sister said to me that I’m “really skinny now” and that she “loves it and that I’m perfect.” Her dad though said I’m “too thin” and “need to eat” (I know I’m not actually too thin so that comment doesn’t even really make sense to me). It’s weird though because I feel like while I don’t have a full blown eating disorder I’m definitely in danger of developing one and it makes me really really nervous because idk what to do to stop it, my mom definitely wouldn’t understand she barely understands with my anxiety and I’m worried she’ll make me eat more than I want to. I don’t count calories or weigh myself a lot (I’m lazy and I also know weighing myself will not help me). I kinda go in cycles with my relationship with food, the way I feel about it might be impacted by my anxiety. And I know I should eat because I need it to function and I try to make myself but there’s a lot of things inside of me that make it hard to do so. Idrk what’s wrong with me but I’m hoping to seek some support with all of this because it is really hard.

It’s whatever I happen to be eating, and every food can turn into a binge. Or anything I look at really.

A couple days ago was pancakes that were in pre-portioned packages, I ate a weeks worth of pancakes in less than an hour…

•field greens/spinach mix
•mac and cheese with shrimp
•brownies
•carrots
•gum

for back ground, i used to be constipated when i was younger and had to go to the doctors for it & everything. then as i grew up, it was only the occasional constipation attack. but then as you can imagaine, my ed really set my gut health back when it developed about a year and a half ago. it got really bad this year and so did my gut/digestive system. i became constipated basically every week and had bm only every 3-4 days.

so i was really happy that i started pooping once, sometimes even twice, a day when i started drinking bone broth. and so i didn’t feel bloated or anything like i usually did. and i felt really good mentally.

well, this weekend, i kind of ate a lot of junk food. i mean had a lot of cookies and the  fast food for the first time in literally months friday night, then ate out at applebee’s for lunch saturday and had ice cream for dinner. and i’m constipated again. pebbles on saturday and nothing today.

Disordered,"Does my ED have a name?  So I have a unique eating disorder, caused by medical trauma. Basically, I had a 2 pound ostrich egg-sized tumor in my abdomen, which made it very hard to eat for years, along with making me very self conscious(it made my stomach very large and I looked pregnant). In 5th grade I got it diagnosed and removed, and went through a pretty major surgery in which I came out of with a c-section type scar and medical ptsd(diagnosed). I've been struggling with eating problems even after the tumor was removed, and I have been diagnosed with an eating disorder. I was wondering if anyone has any idea if there is a category for my eating disorder or not, so I put the description below. Please DO NOT read if you're worried it might trigger you.

&#x200B;

My eating disorder I think is caused by two main components. The first part is the fact that my brain isn't aware that the tumor is not there anymore, so I still feel physically sick when I eat too much(this is because the tumor was so large it pushed on my stomach). The second reason is a bit more like anorexia, but still induced by my medical trauma. I'm so scared that I might develop the tumor again(which I actually just did at a much smaller scale, so that doesn't help) that I try to make my stomach look as far away from how it did before the surgery as possible, and I'm terrified of having a wide stomach.

She had worked at the treatment place and now works for the dietician place, small world. I'm currently restricting but I'm not being as super strict about it as I was about a month ago, I've become a little more lax and started adding in more variety rather than just sticking to safe foods. I was talking to her today, and she asked me what it would take for me to go to treatment, and I was honest, and I said something drastic like something medical to happen. Then, later, I ironically described some medical things happening, like an ulcer from purging and some kidney function issues from laxatives. And she brought this up and referenced what I said earlier and said, ""I guess our definition of severity is different."" But she was right; I already had medical stuff going on; it just wasn't severe enough for me to seek treatment. The real reason I don't want to seek treatment is the age old, ""I'm not skinny enough."" I just want to lose more weight. I'm not underweight at all; if anything, I'm almost overweight. I hate it; I'm not going into treatment like this again. Last time I went I gained 20lbs in two months, sorry for numbers, but it was so dramatic that it put me overweight and it was horrible it left me hating my time there, I was binging and no one addressed it because I was eating, binging is an eating disorder!! No one helped me with it! It was so frustrating. So I haven't wanted to go back at all since. But that last bit made me think about treatment.

Disordered,"Help with binge eating?  I've been struggling with binge eating all my life, ever since I was little. I first reached out for help from my mother, whom I still live with until July, and she said I was fine and nothing was wrong. But she doesn't believe in any kind of disorder unless she has it, diagnosed by a doctor or not. I've asked her not to buy the foods that trigger me the most at the store, like ice cream and other things, but she does anyway. She even gets angry when I call her out on buying it even though she said she wouldn't, and says she feels like she was doing a nice thing for me. I deeply wish this would stop, and I wish I didn't want to starve myself to balance out the binge eating. I want to lose weight, I'm desperate, but I can't with how things are going. I'm stuck where I am on the scale, I want to go down but I keep wandering upwards. I tend to eat an entire tub of ice cream in three or four days, sometimes less.

Even though she said nothing is wrong, I know there's something wrong with me. I overeat every day, I can never stop thinking about my next meal. Food consumes my mind and once I do give in I usually overeat, feeling guilty and sick afterwards because I've eaten, and I've eaten too much. And then, right when the sickness in my stomach goes away, I'm back to wanting more food. Sometimes I starve myself for the rest of the day, even if I only ate once that day, and sometimes I give into it again and just keep eating. It happens every day, and I'm sick of it. I'm not diagnosed by a doctor, my mother won't even consider taking me to get me checked out, but I have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, which I know is contributing to and a result of my binge eating. I've managed to keep myself at a healthy weight, albeit on the higher side of a healthy weight, but I have a big stomach and wide hips, which just contributes to everything more, and it's also making my gender dysphoria worse (I'm a trans dude, btw).

i got put on a new medicine to replace the old one recently. but the way my psychiatrist described it, it sounds like just a stronger version of what i was taking before. i’ve been refusing to take it. i don’t think i ever will. i’m horrified of it. the bottle just sits there on my shelf taunting me. like, i could feel happier if i took it but at what cost."
Disordered,"Started dating a SUPER FIT guy that works out 6 times a week, and hes triggering me.  He knows I got out of treatment last fall. (But what he doesnt know is that I still count everything and restrict myself from going over my TDEE) Today we went out and shared a nutella pizza (Had to prepare myself and pep-talk myself a lot to do this, because it was hard ngl. Nutella and pizza is still a fearfood of mine). It felt good since we shared it and he and I seemed to enjoy the pizza at first. But then after a while he commented something REALLY TRIGGERING. ”Just imagine how much calories thats in this” and then he took a full fork och nutella scraped of from the pizza and said ”like look”. (I dont think he has an ed, but he did sound a bit unsure about eating the rest after, which he didn”t because he said he was full) look, I couldnt finish my last bit because of his comment about the calories and the fact that he didnt eat all of his 1/2 pizza. Now a few hours after our date he texted me ”is it just me or do you also feel a bit weird after that pizza?” (Now Im going to be quite honest. There were NOTHING wrong with the pizza and my stomach feels fine) Im wondering if he has anxiety over the pizza, bevause he gets a lot of anxiety in generall over a lot of things. How can I make this work? If hes too fixated on food because of his training he will keep being a trigger for me because he reminds me of all the things I used to do. We really connect with eachother overall and he is truly like no other guy ive met, so I reallt want it to work between us. My plan is to tell him about me being triggerd when calories are mentioned. But then thwre is this knowing thought of mine that know that just his lifestyle will keep me thinking about training, body, etc. I even sometimes feel like I need to be as fit as him because thats pherhaps what he likes since he works out so much, or that he should be with someone that also works out as hard as him."

Disordered,"lost appetite  i (19F) have been struggling with my ana for 2 years now. my weight has quickly plummeted and i lost my period. 

i have been trying to start recovery these past two months, and it started okay. but for the past two weeks now i have no appetite. i get really hungry randomly, but then when i try to eat i take two bites and just can’t eat anymore eventhough i’m still hungry. i just lose my appetite and no longer can eat the food. this happens with any food i try to eat and it’s becoming very frustrating. my stomach hasn’t shrunk that much has it??? 

anyways could i get some advice on how to overcome this awkward part of recovery? i hate seeing the look on my parents and bf face when i barely touch my food :( but i really just cannot eat eventhough i want to and try to. thank you in advance!

Disordered,"i just want this to be over  i am a sixteen year old girl and my eating disorder started  just after i turned fourteen, after years of hating my body. always had a bad body image, since six years old. i felt i wasnt good enough, ugly and fat although i was always a completely normal weight, a little bit chubby at times but totally healthy. then at fourteen i eventually started starving myself because of debilitating anxiety about my body. it started when i realized that skipping meals made me look less bloated and thus 'skinnier'. my stomach was always my worst insecurity anyway. when id eat a bit more i would get so anxious id have panic attacks when looking in the mirror, because of even MINOR bloating. then it escalated to restricting heavily for months and becoming just a pound from underweight. i felt so bad all the time but at least i finally was.. skinny, as id always wanted.  then something snapped & i started binging. my mental health went to SHIT. because my body wasnt used to digesting the food, ironically that caused me actual, painful, uncomfortable bloating which convinced me i had gained a lot of weight. i got depressed & started self-harming. was put into inpatient ed treatment. gained weight, more and more, until i was at a healthy weight for my body & hated myself more than ever. crash-dieted, binged, repeated over and over again for a year. was at all kinds of different mental facilities because of my anxiety, panic attacks, dissociation and general unableness to live normally. then got a bit stabler as i was put on medication, and moved into a psychiatric unit. (still live here) ate mostly normally. bad body image, but managed it. i lost a bit weight at times, then binged it back, but i was generally so stable i could continue normal living despite of it. was happy, at times. got better. always wanted to be skinnier, but it didnt take over my life. had some periods of restricting, then started binging more severely, sometimes so much id throw up the next day (accidentally, just because how much i ate and how sick it made me) then go without eating a few days and try to get ""back on track"". lived a winter eating pretty normally, sometimes counted calories, sometimes didn't, no SEVERE binging mostly. felt that i was doing well, actually. then decided i should, this time, ACTUALLY lose weight, and take control, and that i could have the pretty body i always wanted this time. was determined to do it, ate 1000-1200 cals for a month. then snapped again despite trying to tell myself its ""so easy for me"" and got into a compulsive binging thats gone on for almost the last two weeks. 
so, repeating the cycle again. the cycle ive been repeating for two years. hating my body. for some time liking my body, but still not feeling good enough. wanting to be skinny, getting skinnier, feeling still bad and gaining the weight back, always in the normal """"healthy"""""" weight range. everyone thinks i am recovered from my eating disorder. i never chose to recover, i was forced to. i felt out of control. i always wished i could go back. 

i am tired. i am so tired. im having the same kinds of thoughts about my body/ weight as i did at fourteen, as it started. its gone on for too long. 
i cant tell anyone. they'd start monitoring my eating and weight. then i couldnt lose weight, and i would have to live with a body i dont like, which would most likely cause me to binge, which would alienate me from my body, which would make me feel even worse. out of control. as  its been. 

i dont want this anymore. 
im tired. so tired.

sorry for the bad writing i am crying as i write this. dont speak english as my first language, cant bother to think about it so hard. i feel so hopeless."
Disordered,"Fuck this disorder in the A!!  So yesterday I had a birthday party, and in the morning I had a snack pack cheese and crackers thing, 170cals, then I made myself a Zero Shirley Temple 100cals (1 can Sprite Zero, 2 tbsp grenadine, and 2 maraschino cherries) it's simple and yummy, aka cherry sprite with flare. Anyways. To me, I had eaten enough 🤦‍♀️. I went in for the party with a I'm going to eat and have a merry time, and not care about the food, I had a large muffin and a piece of cake. Then, after the majority of people left (mind you, this was at a public place, not a home.  We were playing card games), I had started noticing a lot twitches in my hands, lips and tongue. I've had this before with low potassium, but I'm an idiot and let it go. So the night proceeds and I'm now starting to partially black out while sitting down, and I'm unsteady in my seat like I'm drunk or something, this is a café we're in, and we're not drinking. So I take one of the emergency potassium pills I had (I use to get them prescribed when I abused laxatives, so I have some left over and I use them rarely, in cases like this because I'm stupid and I don't go to the hospital like I should). I was legitimately scared at this point; I had never felt quite this bad before. My boyfriend and his friend suggest I should probably eat something and I second that idea because I don't want to kill over on the café floor and make a scene. I go up and to get a sandwich and some chips. When I was looking at the sandwiches, I almost fell over and couldn't properly read the names because my vision was blackening and was in and out of focus. As I ate the sandwich, my boyfriend brought me an orange juice because he's a thinker, just in case it was low blood sugar, even though I just had cake an hour earlier. I began to get my vision back; that was the scariest part for me, not being able to see, then I finished everything, mentally being screamed at by my ed, and my stomach feeling absolutely awful. But I'm glad I ate the fucking sandwich and chips! I felt better, not all the way, though. I was still twitching some but not as bad, but my unsteady feeling and blackout vision issues had gone away. Not 100%, but I didn't feel like death anymore. 
Now, here I am the day after, back to restricting 🙃! 

When there is no rhyme or reason for this disorder, and we do the shit it says without question. Stay strong out there; one day, we'll be better. 


TL;DR- had a potential medical emergency, some potassium, and a sandwich saved the day."

Tw:mention of ED, loneliness, self harm.

Recently my best and only good friend dropped out from collage, and i just found out. She misses school alot so every morning I stare at the seat next to me, waiting and waiting... but she hasn't come for a while. Today on videochat she told me she dropped out.

      I mean, I don't blame her. She's doing it for her own mental health, and I respect that. But I'm not here to post about what to do to keep up our friendship, we've been friends since we where 10. We know how to stay in touch and all that. I'm here because I need help.  I'm just so- lonely. Not really lonely... I dont really know how to describe it.. it's the sinking pit you feel when you know everything's going wrong and you can't do anything... I feel awful... I don't know why

       Recently I've been trying to fix my overeating. I'm trying my hardest. But, Recently I've dipped way under the amount I'm supposed to eat. Hell, I've only aten 930 calories today. Not eating hurts, eating hurts, the taste of food repulses me... it sucks. 

       Everything seems to be tumbling down around me and idk what to do... it's not my fault, but I feel like it is. I can't control this. Everything's out of hand.... I just feel like curling up into a ball and crying my eyes out. I'm very close to self-harming again, after so long of being clean... I need advice, and a friend."

The only things I wished for were mandarines since they're my safe food, and a bullet journal with some pretty pens (basically told my sister to buy whatever in that regard).

Why did i wish for that? To keep track of my progress. My weight, calorie intake, what I burn, etc.

Disordered,"I don't want to get help  I've had trouble with food all my life but my complexion is genetically skinny so it went practically unnoticed, got a few comments from time to time but nothing really relevant. About a year ago I went through a very difficult time and found comfort in food which obviously led to me gaining a considerable amount of weight but I kind of didn't notice till my sister pointed out. At first I tried not to worry too much but then my clothes wouldn't fit me and the rest of my family began to make comments too so I decided to do something about it. I became a vegetarian to stop eating certain types of food without being questioned about it and it worked great, I started to loose weight and even felt more healthy but from there things started to be a little difficult for me, I became kind of obsessed with nutritional values and got pretty restrictive with what I ate. It got to the point of eating one meal a day and reduce hunger by eating a fruit or drinking tea/water. Now I'm skinner than I was before I gained weight but I still don't feel satisfied with my body, the problem is the health consequences of my weight lost are becoming difficult to hide. Two days ago I fainted while going down the stairs, luckily I didn't get seriously hurt but my mom got really worried and basically told me she's going to help me ""get help"" but I don't want to and I can't talk with anyone about it cause they will tell me things I do not want to hear. Right now I don't know what to do, my mom is making appointments with doctors and a therapist and I'm grateful for that cause I know not everyone has someone to support them but I don't want to gain weight again, even the thought deeply frightens me and to know that I'm skinny enough to make people worry about me kind of makes me feel rewarded (?) and think that I'm doing a good job.

Now I am living alone and cannot bring myself to cook.

I started seeing a new therapist and have an appointment with a nutritionist coming up, but I don’t feel like I have the support I need. On the other hand, I have had to leave college to go to a mental health program before.

Disordered,How to Naturally Slim Down and Tone Up?  
Disordered,"i have ARFIDs but my parents keep invalidating me  Hi all! 
I, (16f) is currently struggling with ARFIDs and have been for the past three months due to ocd and ptsd. As soon as it started I alerted my Ed doctor as I previously had anorexia but have completely recovered from it by that point. Now on to my parents, from the beginning they didn’t really do anything helpful and kind of just let me suffer. They didn’t have me boost at all or encourage me to eat more which frustrated me a lot because I want support and don’t want to live like this. They would also make back handed comments if I had only one soda like “how many sodas have you had today?” When they finally realized how bad it’s gotten when almost two weeks ago I got the two week warning from my Ed doctor, meaning if I don’t gain then we take blood work and if my blood is bad then I get admitted to the hospitals did everything get worst.  The doctor and dietitian there told me to eat whatever I can to get my weight up and we’d focus on nutrition later. They’d push heavy fear foods on me and get mad if I didn’t finish it, tell me how they wouldn’t be at the hospital with me, tell me how I’m not making any progress, wouldn’t let me eat my safe foods/comment how much bread I’m having and how bad it is for meand so much more. I was even with a friend yesertday who is vegetarian when my dad asked her “to teach me how to get protein.” At this point I have 5 days left and I’m really stuck on what to do. I really don’t want to go to the hospital again but part of me feels like they will never really understand unless I go (there’s ppl there that will teach them more about ARFIDs) and that I can also get my nutrition up there. Like what do I do? I don’t want to get myself to eat even less so I go because I know I’ve gained but it’s just so hard eating at home with my parents. Also, res isn’t an option for me since I have past trauma from res and my parents refuse to send me past the west coast  which means I probs won’t be able to find a program that specifically treats ARFIDs. Advicd here?"
Disordered,"What the hell do I have  So in June (like 8 months ago) I developed an ed with primarily symptoms of anorexia nervosa. I dipped down very quickly from eating a normal or more than normal amount to (TW numbers) an average of 250 calories per day (it was on a weekly schedule, I had a 2 google docs and a sheet to keep track of everything) and lost about (another tw numbers) 40 pounds in 6 weeks. I started eating a bit more and gradually worked up to a still low but sustainable amount.

But now I'm dealing with some other things. Two different things kinda showed up at the same time. For one, I've begun obsessing on eating healthy (not necessarily less). Secondly, I've also just stopped liking a lot of foods. I can't tell if it's a genuine dislike or if my brain is convincing me I don't like it because I deem it as ""bad"".

(tw for this whole bit maybe? Describing what I eat/don't eat) For context, here's a brief list of what I dislike and think is unhealthy: any meat, nuts, anything with added sugar, butter or margarine, oil, anything breaded, any sauces, potatoes, anything processed too much.
What I'm allergic to: potatoes, avocados, bananas, tomatoes, garlic, onions, nuts, cocoa powder, coconut, dairy (except cheese).
Pretty much everything that I do eat: lentil salad (with spinach, red peppers, and a tiny bit of balsamic dressing), pasta with a sauce made of blended cauliflower, broccoli, and cheese, oats with chia seeds and fruit, smoothie with berries, spinach, and protein powder, and peas with paneer.

If I eat anything that I don't usually, I get really nervous and can't do anything for the rest of the day. There are a few foods that I love but deem as bad (pretty much just bagels and chocolate). These are symptoms of orthorexia right?

But then I also just genuinely really don't like some things, like meat and anything oily. That sounds more like arfid right?

Is there a term for just general ed? Or should I consider myself recovered from an ed but still struggling with disordered eating? I'm still getting enough nutrients but the impact of the constant mental thought is draining.

So yeah what ed do I have, is it general or rotating or not anything or what??"

Disordered,"eds vs disordered eating  

too simplify it verrry much, what is the defining factor between eds and disordered eating? ive been researching this for ages and from what ive gathered i feel it could be (too be put v basic) the volume that it takes up your thoughts/ actions daily. 

i still find it crazy that purging (assuming it meant more than a one off) is considered disordered eating and not something more sinister. - but then again my idea of disordered eating vs an ed is vastly different and part of me wants too believe that disordered eating isnt that bad/ emotionally taxing as an ed. - again thats only because i want too believe that my issues fall into ed territory rather than disordered eating so ig my opinion of that is slightly skewed ha. 

but regardless, do you think an ed could be more defined in comparison by the amount it takes up in ur life / brain space / thoughts etc are mostly if not entirely consumed by thoughts of food, weight, eating etc. and that although disordered eating and eds can follow similar behaviours etc the defining factor lies mostly in the amount it takes up in ur life (if that makes sense).

I have anxiety 95% of the time so it’s hard to tell if my heart problems are from ed or anxiety. I was restricting pretty heavy the past month. I haven’t thrown up in a month. I was binging/purging frequently before that, then I started restricting way more. I’m trying to recover but whatever it’s just been so fucking impossible to eat. I have anorexia but idk if it’s become bulimia in my ~recovery~ but that’s a whole other question. Just a lil info about my ed ;)

I know I need to talk to my doctor about my heart problems but I haven’t been able to admit to them or anyone that I’ve seriously relapsed. I will eventually but for now, hey people. 

I’m always having palpitations. It’s hard to take my heart rate because it’s so irregular most of the time. Sometimes I feel like I have no heart rhythm. It’s worse when I lay down. Sometimes I have other symptoms like chest pain/tightness, lightheadedness, shortness of breath that was once so difficult I passed out. I never get medical help because I attribute this to anxiety. when I have these bad episodes of heart palpitations, my heart rate will go from 70-180 increasing more than 100bpm in just a few seconds. But reaching the high 100s is normal for panic attacks so idk if I need to be worried. I swear any medical issue like this is I just attribute to anxiety. But my anxiety has been okay. Its just been impossible to eat. I picked up vitamins so maybe they’ll help?

Also, I get scared weighing myself because I gained about 20 pounds after starting college and I have never weighed more than 105 before so I felt disgusted with myself.

Disordered,"help: is this considered as an eating disorder? if yes, what is it called?  hi, I'm 20 years old, 5'9 and weigh around 120 lbs. I've been dieting lately, and what i mean by that is i force myself only to eat twice a day. And if i slipped out i feel like sh!t. I also drink coffee after meals to make me even fuller. Sometimes even when I'm so hungry I will just drink lots of water and force myself to go to sleep. But, when i slipped out, it happens continuously. I will eat out for weeks and then stop and start dieting for weeks again. I lost my quarantine fat last year by only eating twice a day and one meal consists of oatmeal. Is this an eating disorder? my relationship with food isn't the same anymore, especially with peanut butter since it was primarily the reason of my weight gain. I'm sure i need help but still unsure of what I'm dealing with. now, i don't see food but see their calories and fat contents. thank you"

Disordered,"Weird friend situation (vent?)  My friend has had surgery recently, and has had some complications causing pain with eating. In the past I have told her talking about dieting and weight loss and things along those lines are triggers for me, and she has been talking about the weight she’s lost every day for weeks. About how she can’t eat and how she plans to eat and then talks herself out of it “because of the pain” Here’s the thing though, this has happened 6 months into the worst relapse I’ve ever had and for the first time in our lives, me being the same size or smaller than her. She is also taking no steps to see a doctor and get herself looked after as she “gets worse” My eating disorder is screaming and competitive, but I’m also very concerned that she has watched what I’ve done; seen how the same thing more or less worked for me for weight loss, and as a result isn’t taking her surgical recovery seriously because she seems to be determined to keep dropping the weight. I’m concerned I’ve triggered something in her too because our entire lives our relationship goes back and forth between supportive and caring, to like weird periods of one upping one another. Thats never been this disorder for me, but I think it might be what it is for her unconsciously. I feel awful for thinking that but the timing is bizarre, that suddenly she finds out my weight and THATS when her “pain” suddenly increased so much she straight up couldn’t eat. I don’t know. My perspective is warped. It just seems interesting that someone who immediately after surgery was drinking milkshakes without issue has deteriorated this quickly and when she saw her surgeon there was no need for immediate follow up?"

This isn't about me, it's about my 9 year old little sister, we live in a very strict middle eastern household, and this little baby gains alot of weight by eating normal amounts, so obviously she isn't over eating (yet) but, she gets emotionally and physically abused when she is caught eating other than the times that were scheduled for her (which is a tiny breakfast, and a couple spoons of lunch and that is it, she will occasionally be allowed to have a chocolate once every two weeks or so) recently this has caused her to eat excessively behind the family's back. I am really really concerned about her, I did everything I can to fight the off of her but I was called things like: ""Dumb"" ""oblivious"" ""arrogant"" ""look at your self first"" and so on and was also physically abused when I tried to step up for her, so that's obviously not a solution...

Disordered,"Please help/advise me  Hello, friends. I've been suffering with what I believe is obviously some sort of eating disorder that has gotten progressively worse over the past 3 years from when it started.

Let me start by saying I am a professional Chef. I LOVE food. I'm so passionate about it. I love cooking it. I love feeding others....but when it comes down to eating, not just my food but any food anywhere, I struggle.

It seems that food just makes feel nauseous. Makes me feel sick. I don't get physically sick but it makes it impossible to eat. I eat one or two bites and I am FULL and miserable and nauseous. It's not certain textures or flavours or smells.. it's all food. I can and have gone up to three days with maybe a piece of toast or something along those lines and that's it. I have consistently lost weight. Over 35 pounds In last year. 7 pounds in just the last week. I don't think I'm fat. I KNOW I'm underweight. I WANT to eat and I know I have to. I just can't. Has anyone struggled with this? I am new to ED'S and I'm just trying to get an idea what I'm dealing with. I drink shakes when I can to get calories in, but they are too expensive to use constantly. Thank you."
Disordered,"I lost weight and just a full rant about my ED  Okay for context. I'm at a friend's grandparents house and their house has a scale.

I kept eyeing the scale, tempted by it. I finally stepped on and watched the numbers. Thoughts raced in my mind. I dont think I lost weight, well I dont look like I did. That sorta've thought. Well I finlu peaked at the number's. 20 pounds I lost that much in less then two weeks. I'm so close to my gw, I am excited that I'll finally be pretty and be happy. I wasn't super big on quitting this. But, seeing the weight I lost is fueling continuing this. 


Sometimes I wonder why I do this. But I always snap back into my thinking. I think the worst reason I do this is because I want to be noticed by someone. I know if they found I do this they would be upset and tell my parents. I sometimes don't feel as my reason to doing this is valid. Which makes me feel as if I don't deserve to eat. I feel sick by my reasoning, because I want to be pretty and thin and I don't think I deserve it. 

I tell my friends I haven't hurt myself since I was 12 (three years ago well soon to be once I turn 15 this year) but I still continue to do harmful things to myself. I cut my knuckles so much they can't be cut anymore. 

I feel like my ED is just a combination of my depression and self esteem issues. I bottled it up for so long and now it transformed into this."
Disordered,"Slowly going downhill with everything (Rant) TW mental health  Rant Section 1/back story: This past month I’m be doing a lot better than normal. My anxiety and tic disorder are reduced. My depression finally feels manageable most days, and my binges have been less frequent. I’ve gotten better at forgiving myself after binges and still choosing to fuel my body with food.

Supposed trigger: My best friend hasn’t been at school for a little over two weeks. I called and texted at least 4 times a day, to get no answer.

She finally called me back on Friday and said she was just diagnosed with depression, and is having a depressive episode. She said she is having suicidal thoughts and to not tell anyone, She never talks about her feelings so this was quite alarming. On Saturday I hung out with her the whole day and she said she felt okay for the first time in a couple weeks. I’m glad to help in any minor way possible.

Present: However, since being told this news I find my acid reflux is flaring up from even broth. And my tic disorder is worsening again, along with my anxiety. I’m tired everyday and don’t have the energy to cook. I’m not eating enough, as I’m barely able to eat anything. I feel physically sick when I look at food and I don’t know what t do. I cant focus well in class and I spend the day thinking about my best friend and calories. I’m cold all the time again, and feel dizzy more often than usual (I have vertigo). 

I honestly didn’t think it was stressing me out that much, at least consciously. I think I’m handling it well, especially having gone through similar myself. But.. seeing as that’s the only thing that changed in the past couple days it’s likely the cause. 

Perhaps even worse the urge to binge is gone completely. Although binging isn’t great, overall in my week I would have enough calories when I did."
Disordered,What Can Be Learned From One of the First Ever Known Anorexia Patients  
Disordered,"(vent) i think ive relapsed and i dont know what to do next.  tw: relapse, restricting, starving, calorie counting, weight loss, body image, intrusive thoughts.

dont read this if you struggle with any of the things above. but if you feel comfortable with it - i really need some advice.

hi, im 17 and ive stuggled with eating, more specifically anorexia, for about half a year now, though ive been ""recovering"" for the past nearly two months. my friend found out and told my parents, they started getting suspicious about everything = i was forced to eat more than i used to. which is great for starting your recovery and living a healthier life and all, but.. i dont think i was ready for recovery. i know i know, i probably would never have been ready, but still - i havent managed to get rid of any of my mindsets that i had while actively struggling with my ed. i thought i did for a while, because i distracted myself a lot or made myself feel better about eating by making healthier, high-protein meals, but the bad mindset has been creeping back in. even worse, my parents have basically forgotten about this whole thing because its been a while since weve talked about it, and they have stopped asking me if ive eaten enough etc.
so now im just in this weird place - i dont want to be miserable again. i dont want to have to lie to the people i love and feel awful and guilty and hungry and weak all the time. i dont want to miss out on more delicious food just to eat one small portion of the same thing every a day. i dont want food to take over my mind again.
but.. i still cannot get the thought of losing even more weight out of my head. at least now i can recognize the damage ive done so far that i had been oblivious to previously - i look way skinnier than before, and i recently realized that ive lost (very roughly) 1/8 of my body weight during all this time. which is bad. weirdly enough though, ""thanks"" to the weight that i have lost, i dont really.. dislike my body anymore. im actually pretty okay with how clothes look on me etc and i dont really want to be super thin and underweight anymore, especially not enough for people around me to notice / worry about. so i really dont know why i still feel such a strong need to become even skinnier. i havent gained any weight back throughout my recovery, but i havent lost any either - which is obviously the point of recovering - my weight has been stagnant. and i really, really hate the thought of not constantly losing weight anymore. its not enough. i am nearly on the cusp of being underweight and it is so incredibly tempting just to keep going. i want to lose more weight, the people around me have stopped caring again, i have every opportunity to fully relapse into my ed. and i know i need to find a way to stop this from happening but its hard to even start somewhere when my mindset apparently hasnt changed a bit.
i downloaded my old calorie tracker again today, which i planned to never do, but i wanted to know how guilty i ""should"" be feeling about my eating. i logged all the food i ate today, which is probably around my daily average at the moment, and it was just over my old calorie limit that i used to eat maybe half of. i havent felt this gross in a long long time, i still feel incredibly sick just thinking about that number. im sure ive gone over the limit a bunch of times recently, and i hate hate hate that thought. i dont know if i can keep eating like this for even a day from now on, i just want to starve myself again forever and ever. i cant handle recovery. i dont know how to stop myself from relapsing anymore, i feel so awful eating normally, i just want to go back. please help me. i dont know what to do at this point. i never thought it would get bad again, i thought it was just a phase and i was over it and it would be easy because ""i was never really sick in the first place"". maybe was wrong.

please, if you have any advice, or experiences / stories to share, or just words of encouragement, leave a comment. i am helpless. sorry for this mess of a text wall, thank you so much for reading."

imagine if someone you know has cancer which is you know- *cancer* and they forget to take medication one time and instead of trying to help them out, or minding your own business you choose to manipulate them and tell them that “you're a terrible person, how dare you miss your medicines? my grandma died after forgetting to take meds, i have so much trauma, why would you do that to me? fuck you.” how's that sound? not so good, right? when someone is on their death bed and you make it about yourself?  i wish people understood this. how much does it take to be kinder to people in pain? "

Nobody noticed when I couldn't even have my arm graze my chest without breaking down.

My ED is the only way I can cope. It's the only way I feel numb and it's the only way to have control over 1 thing. I'm so fucking scared that if I gain weight I'm gonna look like a girl and my dysphoria will get worse again. I can't do it again I can't.

Disordered,"I think im choosing/faking this.  Ok TW: thoughts of restricting and my actions with them
Also ill delete if this sint allowed


Bit of backstory, my mum has had ana and bul all my life and I've been self conscious of my weight since about age 9 roughly. I began thinking of restricting a few years back about age 11 maybe but never did anything. Then 2020 i restricted a bit but could stop at any point ig.

I think i chose this because i ""wanted an ED to lose weight"" and now im pretty sure I'm doing this for that reason but i don't fully feel in control anymore. I feel guilty if i eat, barely can eat around others, count calories etc.

Is it possible to indulge in thoughts and then accidentally fall into it? I have no need to need control and i just want to lose weight, i feel like that isnt a valid reason. And also when people say an ED voice, is that like a voice in ur head not ur own or is it like another side of you?

Any response would be really appreciated"
Disordered,"BED is worse when weight is lost?  I have been overweight my entire life, but have always fluctuated in my weight A LOT. I have never been a “normal” weight past the age of 10. I have a lot of trauma surrounding my weight (bullying, medical treatment, societal pressures etc) and developed BED basically by the age of free will. 

I lost about 40lbs after graduating college. I am still considered overweight after the weight loss - and even though in photos there might be a somewhat noticeable difference to others, I can’t see it. It didn’t really happen purposefully or thoughtfully, just a life change between the pandemic, ending toxic relationships, and just changing from college habits to working habits. I have a very active sport related job as well. 

I am 25 (F) now, and finally decided it is time to address it. After years of living with disordered eating, disordered thoughts, etc. I have allowed myself to accept the fact that I don’t have to be thin to have an ED. I don’t have to be diagnosed to have an ED. I don’t have to be open with friends and family or have my trouble noticed to have an ED. I have always convinced myself that I don’t, I’m not sick enough. 

But now, I want to stop binging forever, I want to stop the disordered thoughts, the constant restricting, the calorie counting, the fear of eating in front of anyone that isn’t close friends or family, the berating myself internally for “messing up”. It seems like now that I’ve reached this conclusion of what I have truly dealt with my entire life, the reality of it - I feel like it’s all consuming. It’s all I think about. It’s getting worse. I’m my lowest weight I’ve been as a young adult (again, still overweight) and yet I feel more mentally not okay than ever before.

They provide every type of supplement, so supposedly it’s okay. They don’t allow people with EDs to do the program because of that. Of course, I’m not diagnosed, because my parents don’t want me to be diagnosed with anything.

Disordered,"I ate baby food until I was 11 years old and it almost killed me.  When you’re a baby, you learn how to chew food. It’s like breathing, you just kind of do it. I was never taught to chew food. My parents would try to give me solid food, but I’d throw a fit and cry. So I just ate baby food, only two different types because I was picky and wouldn’t eat anything else: strawberry banana and I think an orange flavor. I only ate baby food and drank milk (literally nothing else) until I was 11. I had to hide it from everyone. I’d lock myself in a room to eat when guests were over, I couldn’t go to friends’ houses for long, I couldn’t sleep over anywhere, I couldn’t eat at school, I hid a lot to eat and missed out on a lot as a kid because of it. Oddly enough, I was a super physically healthy kid. I was quite skinny, but I didn’t get sick or hurt much. Skip to the middle/end of fifth grade, I was 11 years old. The baby food finally caught up to me and my body began to reject it. Anytime I ate it, I immediately threw it up. Drinking milk was ok but it would come up with the baby food when I’d attempt to eat it. This went on for a month to a month and a half. I was deathly ill, like I genuinely thought every single day that I was going to die eventually from it. I was in and out of school for that entire time and missed a total of 2ish weeks. When I would go to school, I’d have to sit in the back of the classroom with a pillow and a blanket and try to sleep and relax because my teacher noticed and felt bad. My family doesn’t really trust doctors so I never went to see one, but I told my school that I did because how do you tell them that you didn’t? They asked me everyday for a doctors note but I never brought one, luckily that was my last year at that school and there was only a couple months left. Anyway, one day I went to McDonald’s with my mom and sister and I decided to try my first solid food which was their French fries. I was instantly hooked. I stopped eating baby food and I became addicted to McDonald’s French fries. I always say that if it wasn’t for me drinking milk for my entire childhood, I may not have gotten as far as I did. Deada$$ I swear by milk for saving me to this day. This eating habit still affects me to this day. Once I find a food that I really like, that’s all I wanna eat and I get addicted to it. I was addicted to McDonald’s French fries until I was 16/17 years old. I found friends who helped me try new things. I’m 22 now and I’ve branched out and I eat different things now, but not like a normal person. I eat the same 9ish things daily and I still fear trying new things but I’m much farther than I was. I’m much healthier now but I still have a very very long way to go as I’m not where I’d like to be at all and I’m still not fully recovered from it all considering the baby food stuff took up literally half of my life. Chewing is still something I struggle with too so certain foods and I don’t get along because of it. I take forever to chew meat, like literally forever and I’m always the last to finish my food when I go out to eat. I’ve been shamed and made fun of for it many times so it does make it harder to progress. 

I want to leave off with a question. 
Is this something that anyone can relate to? If so, I’d love to hear about it as I have always felt like I’m the only one who’s went through something like that and it’s made it worse on me. Not that I wish this on anyone else, but it helps knowing that you’re not alone."

well, those mindsets really resurfaced today when i was changing and for some reason decided to take a bodycheck. i then compared it to the last bc i took before starting recovery, which was obviously a bad decision. the gaps between my legs have gotten a bit smaller, meaning i had gained fat in my legs. its the tiniest difference, barely noticable to anyone else but me, it mightve even just been the angle. but that broke me down so incredibly much. i sat down next to my mirror and cried and hit myself in the head and felt sick at how disgusting i had become. it completely knocked the wind out of me and i still havent gotten up, im sitting with my back against the mirror, its been maybe half an hour. and all the self-destructive thoughts ive been able to work around for such a long time all just resurfaced.
just yesterday, i had three meals, they were really tasty and i felt very proud of myself. now im already back trying to figure out how i can skip my next meal. it feels like all my progress has been lost. i dont know what to do, i cant handle gaining any more, i cant handle looking at myself, i want to starve myself of any and all nutrition again. i never wanted to feel like this ever again and i never thought i would. but i cant help it and i dont know what to do at all. i cant possibly go back into my old habits, i dont want to have to start from square one. this is awful. i hate this. my head is going to explode.
im not rereading all of this, so i apologize for any spelling errors or bad formatting. maybe someone can relate or give advice. thank you for reading."

Disordered,"Self Re-feeding...?  Hello! I am 17 years old and genuinely blocked off from medical intervention, so that is not an option. Please only tips for doing the re-feeding process by myself/with friends/boyfriend/whatever. 
It's important that I make my current state known:
My bmi is 13.7 and for the past year I've been eating 500 cals every other day, those in between days being nothing. So like: 0, 500, 0, 500, 0,,, yeah. Sometimes 0 goes on several days.

Disordered,"What does hunger feel like?  First of all, I would like to say I have not been diagnosed with an ED and I'm not sure if I have one, but at this point for so long my ADHD has prevented me from remembering to eat until I'm naseuous lightheaded and dizzy and I can never seem to remember before that. It's like i just don't feel it until I'm starving??? I know this is a really dumb question but what does hunger feel like? I more often than not feel nauseous after eating as well, so its a lose lose. I eat fairly healthy when I can so I'm kinda doubting it's my diet... will I always feel nauseous after eating if I waited too long? When I'm working I usually don't feel anything until maybe the last hour or two. But if I feel anything it's usually dizziness... I'm confused as hell and any insight would be nice."

Lately, I've been feeling like I almost..... Miss(?) My old ""habits"" (which were obsessive calorie counting, compulsive exercise, starvation, etc. I never got to a weight that was deemed ""unhealthy"" but the the way I got there was definitely problematic and I never received formal treatment. I also have problems binging/overeating so I've never really felt balanced in my relationship with food. I also tend to have terrible self esteem that waivers between ""I love myself, yay body positivity!"" And being embarrassed to look in the mirror. I feel my thoughts slipping into old, dangerous territory but I genuinely feel like I'm being immature and that I'm too ""old"" to be thinking like this.... Is that weird?"

Disordered,"Ana and depression flashbacks  I have had anorexia for not that long and have physically and mentally recovered. it was conformed by my therapist, my doctors and my dietitian.

i cant really remember the time that i was in my eating disorder. I also cantremember anything about my recovery. I just remember that i have stayed home instead of going to school but i cant remember what i did, i cant remember what i felt… and that is a horrible feeling.

when i started eating again my family was so happy. I had such extreme hunger that i couldn’t go 30 minutes without eating. I know it was normal but even back then it scared me. It took controll over me and it just made me feel sick and uncomfortable. I told my mom that i didnt think it was normal anymore. but she didnt believe me. I told all my doctors, my dietitian and my therapist but all they could say that it was normal and that it would stop. I told them that it made me feel so horrible, i knew it was serious but no one believed me. i got back to an healthy weight, but it didnt stop. my hair stoped falling out, but i couldn’t stop. I got my period back, but i cant stop! But still no one believes me. No i am binging probably every single day. I feel horrible. i cant describe it in words. 

Today i am overweight and the unhappiest i have ever been. 

not so long ago (maybe 3 months) my therapist diagnosed me with mild depression that was probably caused by the covid situation where i live (i live in a foreign country since amost 3 years and haven’t seen my relatives since 2019). that time i had self harm thought but have never acted on them because i was so scared.

It honestly didnt surprise me. Ever since i can remember i was never really happy. I always felt less worthy, lonely, unlovable, stupid, ugly… ever since i was a kid. my family moving and being in lockdown was the main reason for my restricted eating. 

&#x200B;

well, this happened in the past. two days ago my school got closed and we are in lockdown. 

All the memories are coming back. All the restrictive thoughts came back, all the body related thoughts, the hate the disgust. And to make it worse My depression has kicked in and i have these wishes again. And i don’t know how to handle it. All i can really do is cry and listen to music. 

I don’t want to turn to my mom. Right now she is so happy because i am at a healthy weight and i went back to scholl, meet friends all that stuff. I know she means well but i feel so bad. i don’t want anyone to see me backseat i am embarrassed. i am miserable and i don’t know what to do. I am scared because i doing have anything to look forward to. Meeting my relatives in august scares me, going back to school scared me, eating scares me, not eating scares me….

Disordered,"Is this an eating disorder? Trigger Warning???  I dont eat half the day. I don't want to gain weight. I hate my body.

Disordered,HOW IS VERA WANG 72 ? Help.  
Disordered,"I'm lost in the inpatient program.  I've been in my first inpatient program now for 12 days. It is a government funded program where I live. I have so many concerns on my mind and I was hoping for some feedback or guidance. 
Firstly we are on the general psych ward. Which means there is 49 general psych patients and 6 of us. This is beyond scary as there are criminals, perverts and many others with psychiatric disorders who wonder in our rooms and  steal our belongings.  Happy they are here for help but why have we been tossed in the same ward? 
As most of you know our Ed's are result of trauma. Once I arrived I was told there is no trauma therapy in the program. This program only interrupts our symptoms and neutralizes our relationship with food. 
I dont know how I'm supposed to leave here with a mountain of trauma still on my plate. 
They have also taken away the body image program as well. Not all of my peers but most struggle with this as well. Great, the two things which are the root of my ed won't be addressed, what's the point ot being here. 
I thought we would be supervised after each meal or kept together so it would be more difficult to act on our symptoms. Nope we eat and everyone goes there separate ways. Making it very easy to hide our symptoms and act upon them.
I'm also type 1 diabetic and we are forced to challenge cafe desserts each week. This means a piece of triple chocolate fudge pecan cake, or a slice of pie and an enormous butter tart have to be eaten at a meal.  I've been told that I have no choice to eat it, even if my sugar reads 15 or above.  I've tried to explain to them that this is going to put my body in danger. They have responded by saying they will make sure I have extra insulin available when that day comes. WTF?? When I leave here I will still be a T1D and never eat 30 to 50 grams of sugar if my blood sugar reads over 10. 
They have told me to put my Diabetes on the back burner for now as I'm here for my ED. 
We are also in full lockdown as there is a covid outbreak on our floor. They aren't testing patients before they are brought to the ward. Thankfully we have all tested negative but the general psych patients are testing positive as they wonder the halls all day and most won't wear their masks. There are a bunch who are anti-vaxers and making it so hard on the nurses. 
We have been confined to our rooms for 3 days now and they said possibly 10 in total. 
I'm already sliding into a deeper depression as there is only so much TV and reading I can do, I don't nap which leaves me alone with my thoughts making my day incredibly stressful. 
Not being able to just walk our normal eating area and eating in our beds makes horrible thoughts race through my mind. What I'm eating and not having any type of movement afterwards makes me immediately think weight gain. There is no activity to counter the food we are eating. 
I hope all you strong ladies and gentlemen get the help you deserve. I'm sorry for the rant I'm struggling right now."
Disordered,"ED 2.0, 11 years and counting.  Hello, 
I’m in my late twenties and during the last two years I’ve gained a little over fifty pounds. My story starts when I got pregnant in high school with my daughter. I had terrible nausea/morning sickness and threw up for the entirety of my pregnancy. After my pregnancy I decided to just keep throwing up…I threw up almost everyday for about 11 years. My boyfriend (now husband) have been together for about 8 years, five of which we did long distance. During the pandemic, he moved in with me. Because he was there all the time, I stopped throwing up. Living in a small apartment it would of been impossible to hide so I stopped. And I was really proud. Unfortunately, we leaned a little too hard into the fast food arena and we drank way too much wine. As a result, I’m 50 pounds heavier, going from a 00 to a 6/8. It was the first time in my life that I felt at peace with my weight and free my of my eating disorder. You might think wow, this is great! What a great success story. Maybe if we stopped there. But unfortunately it’s not, my husband is very vocal about my weight gain. And now I find myself slipping into old habits. I recently shared with him my story and my struggle with food. This was really hard because I’ve never told anyone and it was so habitual that I normalized it for more than a decade. Anyway, his aggressive approach is destroying me. I find myself hating myself, hating more than just my body but my entire being. I feel like I’m in this losing battle, even if I lose the weight I feel like I’m already so angry with him for making me feel like the numbers on the scale define me. I felt like I was finally overcoming my ED and now I’m in a worse place than before. It’s like ED 2.0 for me, even been toying with multi day fasting! Just wanted to ask for advice. I feel like I’m spiraling out of control and I’m really sad about my regression. I know a lot of you might say I should leave my husband, I’m not doing that. But I would love advice on how to breakthrough to a partner that doesn’t seem to get it, on how to communicate with someone like me about weight."

Disordered,"a little bit about my ed  I started gaining weight when I was 15, since then only thing that’s on my mind is to lose weight. I stopped playing sports cause my friend were smaller than me. I was insecure about my body all the time. I stopped hanging out with people as much as possible. My friends and relatives used to tell me how I look so much mature for my age. And there were guys in their late 20’s or early 30’s  hitting on me. At that time I didn’t know it was possible to lose weight cause I had never seen anyone go from being fat to skinny in real life. I started getting depressed and turned into foods for my happiness. I started binging every single day with no physical activity what so ever. I stopped studying. I went from being A grade student to failing my exams. I was gaining more and more weight without even realizing it. After 2 years, I decided to diet and workout and finally lose weight. I started waking up at 4am just to workout and I was following every diet I saw on YouTube but every diet ended up with a very bad binge. Instead of losing weight, I ended up gaining some extra. Every night I used to look at my pictures from when I was skinny and cry about how I let myself go. There wasn’t a day where suicide didn’t cross my mind. I also found out I had hypothyroidism. So then one day, one of my cousin told me how I hated the idea of eating when I was in middle school and was literally built like a twig. That made me think if I force myself to hate food again like I did in middle school and don’t eat, I’ll lose weight. So I started starving myself and the more I restricted the more I started getting obsessed with food. Then again this whole cycle of not eating for days then binging for weeks started. I struggled with this for 2 years and my weight was fluctuating so much. I was 148lbs and 122lbs in the same month. And talking about my life in general, it was miserable. I used to skip school all the time. I hated everyone but mostly myself. I had no hobbies and only talked to strangers online. And talking about my education I have no idea what did I study after middle school. My brain was never there. I used to daydream all the time and just recently found out it’s a mental illness called Maladaptive Daydreaming. Anyway, after my binge session started getting out of hand I started purging. I was bulimic for 2 months. I used to restrict as much as possible then purge when ever I did eat. I was purging every single day for 2 months from 1-6 times per day. And after that I couldn’t physically continue purging because everytime I tried to, it felt like my organs were gonna come out of my throat. My stomach was bloated all the time and my face was all swollen which made me feel more fat even tho my weight was dropping. All this time I was bulimic, I was weightlifting at the gym. Later on, I decided to eat healthy, eat more protein and lift more heavy. After 2 months I had only lost 5lbs and looked the same which drew me back to ed. No matter how much I try even the tiniest thing trigger me to go back to my unhealthy habits. I can never see myself getting smaller than this. It just feels impossible. I’m gonna be 20 next month and I’m taking this illness with me even in my 20’s."
Disordered,"First time hospital appointment nerves  Hi, I’ve recently been referred to an out patient eating disorder service at a hospital after some doctors appointments and assessments from the primary care team. I guess I’m just nervous and unsure about what to expect. I want to get better but I’m not sure I want it enough or that I’m in a good enough place mentally to be able to deal with the stress of having to keep up with appointments specifically to talk about weight and food I feel like maybe if anything that will just encourage the bad behaviours. 

I’m also nervous that they’ll weigh me I guess they kind of have to. But I’m more nervous about them saying everything is fine because I’m just on the cusp on being underweight by around 3 pounds but ‘healthy’ by bmi standards. A large part of me does want to get better but being told I’m healthy and everything’s fine will just set me back so much because it’s taken a long time to be taken seriously by the system for my mental health. I just feel like a lot of the questions they might ask I’ll likely be really indecisive and torn because as much as I’m fighting it and pushing myself to get help I do feel good when I manage to restrict to the level I want to so I guess I’m just in two minds.

If anybody has any experiences especially in the UK of talking to ED specialists and kind of how they work I’d appreciate it. Specifically how do the doctors deal with a person who is I guess on the fence about getting better. Probably not the best way to phrase it but I hope that makes sense.

This was kind of equally me asking for advice but also ranting sorry about that. I’ve not included many details about my specifics and don’t have an official diagnosis but the closest fit would be anorexia (apart from the bmi but that’s not extremely reliable as we all probably know)"
Disordered,"torn between wanting too try at life or sink deeper into ed before trying too recover  

i feel like part of me is ready too move on 
if you will. try and improve myself and my life and engage and try at life again. ive felt like this for a little while but am still scared too lean into the idea and really give 'recovery' or something like it a proper go. all ive been doing since xmas is trying too restrict and 'failing'. 
my mind feels split af. im changing my mind from one extreme too the next. for instance i just spent two hours researching what would be an extremely restrictive diet and planning how ill start it too all of a sudden thinking maybe *big big maybe* im kinda sorta ready too recover ? 

 i dont feel at this particular moment im using restriction too numb my emotions or as a choping mechanism- i think right now my main reason for continuing restriction and clinging too my ed is so that i can reach my lower weight and then feel 'readier' too recover. as it will also  be more physical. since also im eating around maintence daily even tbkigh i attempt too eat xxx and fail. its like my body is just rejecting restriction again. but im still being vegan??? 

idk im in such a torn place of wanting both but all options seems too have too go through restriction first before i actually consider them. im making myself even more miserable and am now just scared af too feel consistently happy because i worry so so much that ill loose grasp on my ed. so ill just purposely trigger myself etc so i stay depressed oops. im so conflicted and so scared too ask for help or what the right decision is. thanks for reading ooft. sending u all the best"
Disordered,"I fainted today, what's the best course of an action?  So, little context: I have bulimia, I am at healthy BMI but dropped significant amount of weight in last few months and I am probably severely restricting too - I am not a good judge od that.

This morning, I had b/p session and fainted afterwards. I did hit my head, but just decided to stay home from work and recover a little bit. I don't think I have a concussion. 

I ate what I could and it's been 10 hours - my head is still spinning a lot when I get up and I am a bit dizzy, I have a brain fog and my legs feel weak. 

My bf talked me into going to visit my doc tomorrow. She has ""sick hours"" for patients that are currently in sick state, and I'll be visiting her as a sick patient, along with people who have, like, flu or elevated temperature.

I don't know how I should approach my GP tomorrow. Is it even ok for me to come without making an appointment? Should I ask her for a blood panel test? Should I just ask her for a sick leave for few days so I can stay at home and rest? How should I adress my bulimia without it sounding weird? 

I have psychiatrist but the soonest he can see me is next week. I am also scheduled for daily ED recovery program, but it starts next month. 

Did anyone go through something similar? I am scared that I am gonna faint again when I am home alone and hit my head more or something. I am just not sure how my doctor can help me in this situation.

UPDATE: I ended up honestly telling her what happened, she totally blew me off and told me this is matter for my psychiatrist and not her. Even refused to sign my sick leave documentation for past two days, despite the fact that I stayed home due to fainting, which is physical condition, not mental.

Disordered,My story  When I was 7 almost 8 my mom moved into the same house as my father which turned into two years of hell that ended when I was almost 10. The abuse between both my parents was a lot to handle at such a young age and I had my brother to take care of since our parents were always to busy with each other to hang out with us. During this time I became depressed which lead me not eating. I would wait until my stomach hurt to eat and then only eat until the pain went away which didn’t make me full and over this period the stomach pain took longer to kick in so I went longer without eating. I didn’t stop eating because of weight in fact I didn’t care about my weight I didn’t mind how big or small I was it had everything to do with guilt. I felt as though I didn’t deserve to be happy with the situation I was in and eating makes you happy. After we left that situation my dad became poor and didn’t feed us a lot but my mom always went shopping when we were at his house and by this point I managed to start eating again and stay healthy but my dad not feeding us lead me to binge eat when we got back to my moms house because we were so hungry and eating all of the food made me happy. I remember making baked goods for my family and eating all of it myself and they couldn’t have any. Over the next couple of years I bounced back and forth between over eating and under eating. It wasn’t until I started counseling that I realized my problem and at the time I was 30 pound underweight. I realized I had a lot of trauma and that none of it was my fault so I began loving myself and now I’m 12 pounds underweight and getting better everyday I hope this post can inspire others to get better because it is possible it can an most likely will be a long battle but it’s worth it and it is possible you just have to want it

Disordered,"Friends with EDs  I feel like a really shitty person sometimes, because I have two friends who struggle with anorexia, and I don’t struggle as much as them. I had a really rough patch a few years ago where I restricted and purged a lot, and now I’m almost normal aside from lack of appetite from depression.

Even though I know I’m not making up my own struggles (I have gastritis and a herniated stomach to prove it), I tend to invalidate them because “my friends have it worse.”

And it really sucks because while I root for them on their recovery journey, I’m jealous because they both weight less than me. I’m 120 lb, one friend is 115, and the other is 95.

Disordered,"Possible to lose weight in a healthy way while in regression?  Hi everyone! Had this on my mind for a while but not sure how to best explain it. (First post here and very sensitive, please be kind)

I’ve had an eating disorder since high school, and fought with it for many many years (28f). It’s been a big goal of mine to talk with a nutritionist about losing weight in a healthier manner. Someone to hold me accountable while slowly losing weight. I used to teeter between not eating for days and obsessing over every calorie. I was put on a waiting list for a well renowned nutritionist clinic back in June, and had my initial appointment in November. I told the nutritionist what my goal was: losing weight steadily over time, until I got to the weight my body worked best at, which is 60 lbs lighter than I am now. I want to be held accountable and have milestones so that I don’t regress into my bad eating habits. Not looking for a date in mind to get back to that weight, just whatever works best for me. The nutritionist cut me off and told me that no nutritionist or medical professional would ever help me with that goal, and it broke something inside me. Is it possible to find a medical professional who can work with me on losing weight carefully?"
Disordered,"Did/Do I have an eating disorder?  So, throughout my childhood I was able to maintain a healthy weight, but after a while I began to receive comments from a family member stating that I was getting fat and needed to lose weight, despite my doctors saying that I was the proper size for my age and that going a few pounds over was fine, as long as I keep it in control. 

Anyway, I tried letting it go and eventually I did. I was a pretty happy kid for the most part and almost always ate 3 meals a day and never skipped until I reached age 11 or 12. Around that time I became more self-conscious about how I looked, but l'm not exactly sure why...I really don't understand what caused it all, but one day I just got in my head and thought that I shouldn't eat anymore because I thought people would judge me for it. Like when l'd go to school, I'd just force myself to think that people were making fun of me for eating and so I stopped eating like I normally would to make all those thoughts go away. I just really dreaded eating in front of people. 

Instead of eating healthy meals, I would only eat potato chips or soda ONLY throughout the entire day and I did this for months until I noticed that my clothes were getting looser. Then I weighed myself one day and noticed that I had lost a significant amount of weight, but it didn't bother me. I actually like the fact that I was losing weight because it made my legs and waist look smaller and it became so bad to the point where my ribs began to show. 

Eventually, my significant weight loss began taking a toll on my health and I started feeling more dizzy, developed diaestive problems, had shortness of breath, and started to feel more weak whenever I tried doing normal activities.  I thought |  was fine though because I went to the doctor about it multiple times and they always told me that nothing was wrong with me, but it definitely feels like there's a problem because I've never had these problems before this started. 

 So here we are today…Over the years I have tried to fix my eating habits, but I don't think I'm doing very well with that.  I was so used to ignoring myself when I got hungry that now I forget to eat sometimes.  Like l'll eat maybe once or twice a day now but l'm not like how I used to be because usually l'll just eat one large meal and just skip for the rest of the day or just eat small portions of food just to say I've ate something.  It's really frustrating too because people just don't seem to understand that I'm trying and only see it as me being a difficult person, but the way I feel is more complex than they think.  

Anyway, I was never diagnosed with an eating disorder nor do I know if my situation qualifies as something of the sort, but if someone could offer me suggestions or advice on how I can fix myself, please do so.  Thanks!"

Disordered,"Fuck you ana  Little rant but some of y’all might relate

im a 15yr old male and i have been suffering from anorexia nervosa for almost two years now.. and this illness is ruining my life im sitting here crying trying to calm myself down because i just stepped off the scale and it told me i gained a kg and while i know that this is most likely not the truth and the reason behind it is that your weight fluctuates throughout the day AND i also had liquids and food in my stomach that would contribute to me “gaining weight” i cannot convince my eating disorder.. this sounds so twisted and sick and believe me i know but .. i have worked SO hard to get to my weight that i am now .. i have lied to people.. i have thrown food away… i have hid my meals..i have purged and i have suffered to get to this weigh for so long.. so for me to step on the scale after eating a bit more than i usually do and to see it go UP … it ruins me.. and i know that its so so twisted and horrible to live life by a number, but sadly that is part of this illness .. my friends treat eating disorders as a TREND and while ik that could mean they are just as sick it makes me so sad.. this illness is slowly killing me.. MENTALLY and physically.. im so so so tired of ana .. and i know that i should start recovering but the truth is i CANT i physically cant because then i feel like a failure . because i recovered before hitting my goal weight .. and the sad thing is that i KNOW for a fact i wont be able to stop untill im at my goal weight and that scares me..i know i wont stop untill im hospitalised and that scares me more because ME as a person doesn’t want to go to hospital .. but my eating disorder does and ik that even if i do it still wont be satisfied “ you could of gone lower” “you cant see all your bones” its a never ending cycle.. anyway my point is eating disorder are SERIOUS and can kill you at ANY and i mean ANY stage normal weight.. underweight or overweight.. they are not glamorous and while i know that basically all of you on this reddit already know that because your suffering from this illness too i still think it should be said.. i would trade ANYTHING to have never gotten sick in the first place but sadly thats not possible.. and to the person reading this boy,girl,non binary .. if you too are also suffering from an eating disorder just know I SEE YOU.. I HEAR YOU AND I AM SO SO SORRY.. i wish everyone the best on their recovery and hopefully me too ily 💗"

And the main one is bulimia.

TW
Idk, at this point I have to admit my bulimia is starting to be kinda prominent again. I am purging like ten times a week, lost over twenty pounds in two months (although I am still on the higher end of normal BMI), and despite the fact I am used to this considering its been going on for over ten years, even I am becoming worried. 

I am looking over all my resources again. I do have an option to go to daily treatment center or to get hospitalized, both for free, I'll get medical leave from work, my bf is okay with it, the only downside is the waiting list which I would be on for like two months. 

It's just...I've been there two times already (to both the daily treament and hospitalization) and while it helped for several months, I always relapsed. 

It feels kinda pointless to put my life on hold again for something that failed twice already. I know third time's is a charm, but, like...i feel discouraged and I'd rather just let this go on and see where it takes me. Sounds morbid.

Another thing is that I am ashamed to be going for the third time already with no visible progress. It's like spitting into doctor's faces. 


My head is a mess right now - I keep going over the email I wrote out to them, contemplating if I should send it.
I am not sure it's worth it, but what's the other option? Waiting it out till it gets so bad that something terrible happens and I will be forced to recover?"

    She used to be chubbier and I've always been underweight (til recently). 
           She's recently been hospitalized with anorexia and admitted to counting calories for three years and starving and working out for 2. I went to go visit her the other day and she was crying and crying I told her that we missed her at our family gathering (moms are super close see each other often) she just shook her head and coolly replied 'ur the one who got me here' I was shocked but when I questioned she shook her head and said nevermind.

Disordered,"what is happening lmao  1. so this has happened twice to me and i don’t know if it’s normal or i should be concerned or??? 

both times i started my day with iced coffee from dunkin’ because it makes me feel full for a while for whatever reason. i restricted for a while, maybe having a couple snacks in between then ate dinner. i ate until i was full at dinner but then like an hour later my stomach started feeling weird? it just kept making noise and then i started to feel hunger pains. i have really bad anxiety and ofc thought i was dying or something lmao but i know that wasn’t it. but it kept me up for at least 3 hours the first time and 2 the second. 

i know stomach acid has an effect on an empty stomach and you shouldn’t drink coffee first thing. did that have something to do with the pain? like how long does affects from stomach acid last? or was it just from restricting so long? 

2. i don’t usually eat breakfast but recently by like 9:00am with no food i get super dizzy. any suggestions on how to prevent this? you’re probably like just eat but like is there anything else i can do because it’s happening in class😭

3. i think (?) this is a side effect from restricting but what’s up with the nausea? is it normal to feel super nauseas when you haven’t eaten or after eating? and any suggestions on how to help it? that is like the worst feeling for me

Disordered,"Any advice  Hi everyone so I’ve struggled with my weight and body image for as long as I can remember. When I was younger I was insecure about my curves and when I tried to lose weight I would gain more. Eventually the slim thick trend came and so I was able to accept myself and embrace my body. However, after barely a year of my new found confidence I experienced a huge weight loss. I lost 20lbs w/o trying and I didn’t know what to do. My health suffered and my confidence plummeted as a result. It was embarrassing cause everyone noticed and pointed it out i was the skinniest I’d ever been(113lbs and I’m 5’7 for context) In 2021 I finally was back at my ideal weight (134lbs) after nearly 3 years of fluctuations. I felt good happy and healthy only for my weight to dip back down after my 21st birthday.I was stressed out around tht time and had trouble eating but I managed to keep my weight at 125 only for it to dip to 120 and now I’m teetering between 117 and 120. I don’t kno what to do it feels like I can’t control my body. I can’t gain/loose weight when I want to and I don’t even trust my eyes when I look in the mirror. When I try to eat I feel anxious and my appetite is nonexistent sometimes. I’m scared of losing more weight. Any advice on how to manage this? Is this even considered an eating disorder?"

Disordered,"Eating  I’ve been struggling with my eating habits for about two years now and the last 4 months it’s been getting a lot worse. Let me explain. I physically can not eat unless I am in my apartment alone. I don’t know when it developed this extreme but it started off two year ago with me not being able to eat at work, then I couldn’t go out to dinner cause I literally can’t eat. When I eat outside of my apartment the food literally makes me want to vomit. I promise I’m not exaggerating. I can eat a bag of Doritos (my favorite) in my apartment but if I were to drive to a park it would literally make me nauseous to the point where I’d want to vomit. I’m not uncomfortable with my weight, in fact it’s scaring me that I’m losing too much weight (none of my clothes fit). So it’s not because I want to lose weight. It has nothing to do with my appearance. I literally can’t eat outside of my “comfort zone”. Which means I’m eating once a day. Sometimes if I’m anxious I can’t even eat in my apartment. I feel hungry & fatigued everyday. I can’t keep doing this. Yes I’m in therapy, yes I’ve told my therapist and he literally never brings it up. What is wrong with me?!

Disordered,"No appetite  I’m not sure what’s wrong with me but ever since August, I lost my appetite and I rarely eat anything. I went from 203 to 150. I’ll have an endoscopy done on Jan 3rd but this is so depressing. Doctors keep telling me it’s anxiety and depression but I don’t think it is, well I really don’t know. I just want to be able to sit down and have a meal again and gain a little weight. This is so sad man, I never been like this 🥴😔

Between no appetite, anxiety, panic attacks, GERD, post nasal drip and emetophobia, I don’t know what to do anymore. But I know one thing, these doctors suck!!!! (Sorry, I’m just really fed up right now)"
Disordered,"Prolonged stomach pains?  I know I can't ask for medical advice but I'm just curious if anyone else experienced this? 

For context, for the past couple weeks? months, maybe? I've been purging anything I eat, & other times I try to restrict as much as possible. I've dropped a significant amount of weight recently (just as early as this past July/August I was still in the 160s, whereas as of today I've hit 140.3lbs), & much more recently I've been far more restrictive. 

Maybe 3 days ago I remember eating extremely little (probably <200 cal.), & I don't remember if I purged. But the next day or so I didn't eat at all. Then yesterday I ate some of an apple (shared with my pets that can eat it), I had a cup of yogurt, some Goldfish crackers & 2 small waffles leftover on the counter from breakfast that day. I 'binged' that all (my 'binges' are usually 'normal' portions/calorie counts for meals & hardly surpass even healthy amounts of calories, but I always eat it all at once) in one sitting & immediately purged it. 

Usually I let myself by with probably a net of 200-300 calories a day, even if I purge I know I can't get it all, but it's still very restrictive. 

Anyway, I think not eating a single thing & purging the only thing I did eat after 2 days just took it out of me, because when I woke up today I felt like death. I woke up with a dull sharp pain in my stomach, & by the time I got up to use the bathroom it was shooting through my whole body, especially in my lower abdomen, almost mimicking period cramps. 

As I write this the pain seems to have subsided for the most part, but it's so consistent & painful. Today, I'm not going to be purging; I know one more day - hell, a lot of more days - of this starving isn't going to kill me, but I can't be starving myself that badly. So far, today, I ate about half an apple, a peanut granola bar, & a glass of water. 

The thing that drove me to write this post though was because of how persistent the pains were? I started with the apple to help & admittedly ate it very slowly, but probably by the time I had 5 pieces of it (about 1/4) I felt essentially no change in the pains & I gave in & ate the granola bar (reluctantly, because why is a single tiny granola bar 170 calories?). 

I sipped the water in between bites of everything & I'm hoping that helps me feel more full. I just still feel hungry but in a way that I don't want to eat. I could barely stomach eating the food I had today, but I'm worried that I've gone from my old habits of binging all day earlier this year, to now I'm forcing myself to eat something, anything, because I just feel that shitty. 

Do others experience this really bad pain too after restricting like that? Because I've had bad hunger pains that make me wanna throw up, but those go away pretty fast after a bite or two. These pains feel like they shoot through my whole abdomen & make me feel sick & weak. Just curious if this is common with heavy restriction, because I've never felt them this bad before

is it normal too go thru phases in ur ed where you just dont care anymore / have lost the reason too restrict or engage in ed behaviours and r just kinda ""normal"" for a few weeks

i just feel so numb & my life so bland that i dont rly care right now too cry over it anymore or too franticly restrict the next day.its not like this doesnt make me hella uncomfortable. i just feel nothing no good or bad emotions just uncomfortableness & worry my ed is slipping away. not caring enough on either side too continue restriction or eating normally.


i cycle alot thru different phases like p/b, pure restriction, over excersize, lax abuse etc. 
but rn im not rly doing any of that for the past two weeks and im scared my ed has gone or smth. 
ik its not rly true- the thoughts r there, theres still things i refuse too eat and behaviours i use. 
i feel disgusting & am planning on how too loose the weight but i just feel Nothing rn & its causing me too not care enough about if im gaining etc.  


is this just part of a cycle do other ppl w eds kinda sometimes go too a point of remission?? idk what too call it.

Disordered,"I feel like the people that are helping me are actually making me lose my mind and get worse…  I (17F) heavily restricted for two weeks a couple weeks ago (one meal a day) and lost a considerable amount of weight which made my parents notice and freak out. I had already been reducing my portions and everything for several months; maybe around four. Everything has gone downhill pretty quickly.

Anyway, my parents don’t trust me at all when I tell them that I ate my lunch at school (I‘ve frequently tossed it out or given it to my friends and said I ate it). They insist on asking my friends which is horrifying and they have done so several times. Today, I ate in a teacher’s office who is really chill and now my mom is FORCING me to have the teacher email her to confirm I ate it.

I hate this so much. I literally can’t anymore. I want people to leave me alone. I don’t care about what happens. I need my parents to stop annoying me and interfering with everything. I hate everything about me already, I don’t want them to get more involved.

It's like I associate it with some sort of fucked noestelgia. It makes me so deppresed eating normal meals everyday. 

A weird psrt of me just wants to be freezing cold hungry and tired all the time. But I know if I go back to that I'll just be more unhappy it's so dumb.

Disordered,"is it possible too still have an ed if things like this happen  
for instance when im deep in my ed ill engage intensely in many behaviours & thoughts; and theres a devastating emotional impact but then depending on circumstance seemingly within days of eachother ill sometimes eat things id previously find too stressful to and eat alot/ or a normal amount. and not be too bothered or engage in compensatory behaviours or purging. sometimes feeling full will make me cry and sometimes i dont really care. or ill know i will have eaten over maintenance consistently for a few days or kinda binged- but tell myself ill wait till i feel the need to restrict and loose it all then. literally within days of eachother. 

it feels like i constantly am switching between the mindset of deep in my ed too a almost healthy 'normal' brain and eating. ( the thoughts r still there just quieter and i dont act on them as much/ dont have the energy or just dont *care* enough tbh. ) 
 
The normal eating with little guilt (not because it was safe foods or id compensated- just genuinley alright w eating it ) only lasts from about maybe a meal, sometimes a day or at most a week. but the thoughts are alot more present when its longer eating normally. 

its like either way ill always creep back too engaging in my ed and restriction,  trying too make it worse than last time. 
but if i really had an ed why is it sometimes so easy too flip back and forth between these eating and thought patterns. i dont choose too im sure but its so frustrating. im not ready too recover or eat/ feel normal for good- but i also feel i cant consistently restrict and its so frustrating. i cant restrict like i used too and miss how i looked. but also want to enjoy food when i am able too because the moments when i feel ok and alright r fleeting. 

its like i can never engage long enough in any behaviour too be considered a 'pure ed' in my head; binge restrict cycles, pure restriction, over exercising, purging, im just constantly going between them all and i hate it.

like what. this morning i sobbed for an hour over a bowl of cereal. but then was able too last min go out for dinner with my family. i mean i still was checking cals etc and the thoughts were there, but I CHOSE too eat dinner AND desert. no one forced me. 

like why do i feel like im constantly fluttering between my healthy brain telling me too bloody give life a try and get out of this hole, and the other telling me too just go deeper into my ed than before- and Then i can recover and think about how too sort my life out and ill be ready and worthy too recover. 

neither sounds appealing so im just in this uncomfortable middle of not wanting too engage in either. ik ill think different by the morning & probs restrict but i'm so tired of this. 

at least i felt not so bloody depressed later in the day meet my family lol. i think feeling like that made it much easier too eat. i feel so invalid. just be consistent fml. anyone else ever feel similar."
