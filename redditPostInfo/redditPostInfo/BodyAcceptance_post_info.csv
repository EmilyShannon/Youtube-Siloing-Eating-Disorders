Neutral,"Question out of curiosity  Hi all, first time poster in this sub. I’m 43 with 30 years of body shame under my belt. In recent years I have gone through periods of been ok about my body but this seems to be when I’m not going through bouts of IBS. This is partly because clothes fit better in non IBS time but I think also my mood is different. Anyone have a similar experience. Right now I’m on a ten week bout of IBS never felt as bad about myself as I do now. I can’t see how to fix this?"

Neutral,"finally stood up to a bodyshamer  I have been bullied, ignored and shamed all my life for being a little overweight. School was in particular horrible, but it got over and I cut contacts with most. 

In the past 4 years, I have struggled hard to build body confidence and have succeeded in it gradually. I accept and love my body as it is, and as it will be at any point of time. My therapist thinks I have made a huge progress. 

But I still mainly have 3 people (2 relatives and a neighbour) in my life who have shamed me for my body size and food choices ALL MY LIFE and still do. I had a pretty shitty childhood. 

So today I finally opened my mouth and gave an answer to the neighbor, we'll call him Sam.

Context -

- Sam loves giving unsolicited free advice on weightloss. 
- Sam follows a dietitian on Facebook and thinks he knows a lot. 
- Sam himself does barely anything to remain fit. 
- Sam also invited me for lunch once and said out loud in front of others ""eat well! Don't worry about your diet today"", assuming that I was on a diet, because weightloss acc to him is the only goal of an overweight person's life. 
- Sam, knowing full well that I had just recovered from Covid, appreciated how pretty I looked after I had lost weight because of covid!

Sam today told me, without being asked, how I can lose 700g every month. So before he could go any further, I said exactly this -

""Honestly, I have cancelled ""weightloss"" as a goal from my life. I like and am perfectly okay with the way I look. I am healthy and can brisk walk for an hour every day without any problems. So I do that, as my goal is to be just happy.""

His son, my best friend and brother figure, loved my response gave me a hi five and said that I'm really smart😆

I had been waiting for an opportunity to say this to Sam since 2019."

Let’s get a few things straight, darlin’, let me be clear. It appears that somehow, you’ve got the wrong idea. 

And they are trying to feed you with absurd flights of fancy,

and all manner of wild suggestions, thinking you’d believe them. And that’s a bit insulting. But you know well that’s just a fib, what they must think of me is quite revolting.

If you’d allow me I’ll explain to you, once and for all, that what lays before you in all directions, is just that old, cold cell wall.  

We ought to clean house now, for a swift reality check. 

You will always come home to me, you will always thirst to go back.

You never had the power, and you never will. These are just unfounded rumors, it is ***I*** who fronts the bill.  

It is MY jurisdiction and ***I*** am the authority here, in this broken, pathetic existence of yours, my lone, lonesome dear.

What I am really getting at, is that you are but a pawn on my chessboard, and a broken piece at that. 

I know you know better, that you did not take control, you never got on top of it, and no, you do not own your soul. 

It was ***I***, who let you out of the cage. 

It was ***I***, the merciful, the generous, the selfless. So pay close attention you helpless, worthless thing- how benevolent I am, and kindly, I am for you everything.

With all due respect, to your cute team and friends and family and all, they do not know you like I do (that you are but an insect under my sticky-icky shoe), and you know me too, that I am death incarnate, under the most sickening of masks. I am bile. I am cancer. I am the question and the answer. I am what came before and what will come after, I am despair I am the plague, I am the chicken, and I am the egg.

And I am patient of nature, and that is your luck.

So I’ll let you have your little stint with freedom, your little dance with life. 

I will release you to the wild, to for a minute taste relief. You may forget about me for a while, and even inanely conceive that I no longer exist. And I’ll let you believe it, if you must insist. 

Silly you.

Because deep inside you know the truth. That this is by no means redemption, this is not emancipation. 

For ***I*** am the one with the key, and no, I am not setting you free. 

So listen, and listen well-

Please relish every bite, please savor every flavor. Roll it on your tongue and chew it slow. I won’t mind at all if you even drool a bit, you know.  

And you will eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat until you drop unto the floor. Until you’d want to vomit. And then, you WILL eat some more.

Oh it’s so much fun to toy with you this way. You are my bread crumbs, my provocation, I’m the potter, you’re my clay.

Because soon, you’ll come back to me crawling, when you realize what a dire mistake you have made. You will return to my loving, comforting arms, as you always do. 

And I, I care about you, I won’t leave you alone with this horrible, terrible, awful feeling. I won’t leave you as often others do. Aren’t you the luckiest to have me on your side? I am practically a prize. 

And I, I will be home. 

I’ll leave the porch light on for you.

And you, you won’t even knock, you’ll fall right at my feet and I will then do with you as I please. 

Just like fairy floss that melts in your mouth, a gossamer swaying the breeze; we’ll begin again with much resolve, with a bit of a sting, but with such ease.

We’ll have work to do, you and I. But that’s half of the fun anyway.

And we’ll do it together, me and you as was always our way, we’re such a good team, for forever and a day. 

Oh I can hardly wait. Look at me, I’m practically drooling myself. 

And this time, my dear, we’ll go for the trophy. Look how far we’ve come together, you and I. 

Because I and you, my pet, are one and the same. Don’t listen to them. They don’t know you like I do. And you know deep inside that you are me and I am you. 

Next time when you come back to me, devastated once more, bruised from the battles and scratched from the wild, I’ll be there to pick up the pieces, I’ll pretty you up, our differences reconciled. I’ll hold you through the nights. I’ll navigate your days. 

I can’t wait for the pain. 

I can’t wait to do this with you all over and again. 

And here is the best part, the best part of the plan. For I am the devil, a nightmare, your bogeyman. Next time, perhaps?Your dance will be one with Dame Demise after all. Next time, we’ll make sure, it will be your final, glorious, downfall.

Neutral,"How to act around people with body issues?  Hi everyone, I am new to this sub, and hope to find some advice.

Some background: I am from Vietnam, where women's bodies are criticized by everyone as a norm. I have gone through my body acceptance journey, but most of people around me have not. This lead to situations where my beautiful friends saying on a daily basis that they are fat, and I immediately tell them that no they are not fat, their bodies are ok.

I just saw a video in which a woman said that she used the word fat just to describe her body, and she found the reaction ""You're not fat, you're beautiful"" problematic because it implies that you can't be fat and beautiful.

It's just that when my friends say that they're fat, they usually mean ""I need to get on a diet"", ""I have to skip lunch""... which is something I find very harmful.

After watching the video, I don't know if I am projecting any remaining body issues on my friends? Is being uncomfortable with their use of ""fat"" my problem?

I guess ""fat"" is a relative adjective, so you can be ""fat"" if you're comparing yourself to a traditional model? If all the derogatory meaning are removed from that word, should I be comfortable with others using it?

I know that I cannot force anyone to accept their body, I don't even want to bring any attention to body sizes at all, but I feel bad when I feel that my friends don' appreciate their bodies.

Should I stop protesting when my friends say that they're fat? How should I act instead?

Thank you for reading my rant."

Sizes covered: 2.6"", 3"", 4"", 5"", 6"" (possibly higher?)

Paraphrased text next to sizes:

- 3"": 3"" is enough

When I auditioned, the director told me that the character needs to be sexy and gorgeous and blissfully unaware of it. I just found out that I didn’t even make the cut for callbacks. I’m trying not to speculate too much, but I really feel like I didn’t get the role because of my body. I’m overweight, and it shows. I thought I could pull it off by being a curvy kind of sexy, but I don’t think that’s what the director was going for. 

I just feel stupid for putting myself out there like that and setting myself up for this disappointment. I even told friends and family about the audition because I thought I did pretty well, and I was so excited to get back into acting after 9 years (never had time to with all my schooling after high school until now). Obviously, I could’ve not made the cut because of my acting, but I just can’t shake the feeling that it’s also because I’m not skinny enough…"

Neutral,"My friend is trigger ALL my body issues  I have a really great friend who is just the complete opposite of me. She is 4'10 and very petite, while I'm 5'10 and curvy. 

She is studying to be a personal trainer and comes over to ask me questions about her studies, she is English as a second language so I help her with the vocabulary otherwise I know nothing on the topic. 

She came over today to talk/ vent about how she was going through her wardrobe and how her sexy clothes don't fit because she gained a few pounds over summer. She tells me that she took pictures of herself in these body hugging clothes to show herself when she's hungry how her tummy rolls over the waist band.  

She continues to tell me that she was working out and when she was doing squats her legs were shaking and she was embarrassed that people might see her at the gym.  I asked if she had eaten, and she tells me that she is only eating 1 meal a day.

I very bluntly told her that what she was saying was really bothering me,  and triggering a bunch of my issues with body image and food. 

She didn't understand where I was coming from,  and said things like "" oh,  you're not fat, you are tall."" and ""you have great thick legs and big boibs.""

My wondering is how do I explain how these comments are not as complimentary as she intends, and I struggle everyday with how I feel about my body."

Neutral,"Nothing off limits  Nothing about my body or my face was off-limits from my intensely critical view of what I was supposed to look like. I have had disordered eating since I was 10. It has run the gamut from binge eating to bulimia to anorexia. I have had a larger body and a smaller body. Whatever relief or satisfaction I thought would be mine when I arrived at that magical number on a clothing label or a body scale only gave way to new criticisms and standards and a pivot to the next thing that needed fixing. I grew up with Farah Fawcett as the beauty ideal. My Mom was always dieting. My Dad made comments about women that tied their value to their appearance, and weight was a very clear indicator of whether a woman was acceptable or not. The messages were clear. In order to have value, I had to be thin, pretty and pleasing to men. Ugh. When I look back, it was like a prison of sorts. 

My body has been through a lot. Periods of intense excercise and periods of sedentary inertia. Gall bladder disease. Crohn’s disease. Metastatic cancer requiring radiation and chemotherapy. Lots of cosmetic procedures including invasive surgery, all with pain, downtime and occasionally complications. I spent thousands freezing my fat.  It was like being on an endless journey of self-improvement that was actually fueled by self-hatred. I just didn’t know it. Now I do.  

I started the work of healing what was underneath all of this after a devastating betrayal that left me feeling dark and empty inside. I was determined not to let something like that happen to me again and I wanted to understand my part in it. I realized that this was all fueled by lack of love and compassion for myself. All these messages I was telling myself or allowing in from other sources were lies! They were constructs. Self-hate is learned and it’s so common that it seems like truth. It isn’t. Once I shifted into viewing myself with unconditional love and compassion, my disordered eating faded away. I have abstained from cosmetic procedures for 423 days (so says my app). I have no desire or plans to ever do them again. If I find myself thinking about it, it will be an indication that I’ve slipped back into self-hate and that something else is going on. I don’t examine my face or my body any more and make a mental list of what needs to be fixed. I am embracing my early 50s. I don’t poison myself with body shame. There was a magical shift that occurred when I finally loved and accepted myself exactly as I am, that has changed every single thing in my life at a foundational level.  I feel like a new person.

I am really thin. I am not the “ideal thin body”. I have been mistaken for having an ED. I wanted to try boyfriend style or mom jean style shorts and was disheartened by how bad I looked in them because of my skinny legs.

I wear leggings all the time, but I’m afraid when I do get biker shorts I will look awful and disgustingly skinny. Does anyone have any tips for how I can feel good in clothes that I want to wear?"

I literally can't use the internet or leave my house without comparing myself to other women. I'm not exaggerating-- I can't use social media, go grocery shopping, or even watch porn without comparing myself and triggering a depressive spiral. It's driving me crazy, it drives my partner insane, I just want to live my life. I thought changing my body would help me find confidence but I realize now it's just been my eating disorder the whole fucking time. Even though I no longer actively engage in behaviors, the mentality is destroying my life.

I tried going to an LGBT+ pride fest today and couldn't help comparing myself to other women who looked smaller, sexier, happier, etc than me. I just want to live my life and I feel like a slave to this desire to be perfect.

It's not that I don't think I am attractive or 'good enough'. I actually do like the way I look most of the time and I am generally able to recognize my strengths in other areas. But it's not enough. It's like I need to be the prettiest girl in the room *at all times* (which is never the case), otherwise my existence is entirely pointless. I hate this feeling and idk what to do about it."

The logical side of my brain tells me that yes, this is a fact, being overweight does affect the amount I spend on gas, just as it affects many other things I spend on but there's something about being shamed for my size by my father that I can't shake off at the moment."

Disordered,"Self-love Journey  I have always been a bigger girl. I have struggled with eating disorders, constant dieting, punishing myself with exercise and skipping out on fun adventures because i didn’t believe I deserved it until i was a certain size 😔Fast forward to 2014. I had two babies within 18 months.  My body was never going to be the same again. 
I was feeling so hopeless.
In 2016 I found the body positivity movement.
I bought the book Body Positive Power by Megan Jayne crabbe and it CHANGED MY LIFE. 
I haven’t weighed myself since 2017.
I am no longer letting a number on the scale dictate my life.
I am practicing intuitive eating and not feeling guilty when my body tells me it needs chocolate.

I am finally free. Happier than I’ve ever been. And the best part is, I get to pass these lessons on to my children.
As lizzo says, if I’m shining everybody gonna shine ✨ 

Anyway, love yourself 🥰

Share your journey with me! Or any books/influencers that broke you out of the self-hate cycle!!!"

Neutral,"Struggling after Dr. visit  CW disordered eating, medical judgement

I had an appointment with my psychiatrist this afternoon and it's left me feeling very disheartened.

I know I'm fat, and I've been working for years to accept that as a neutral state of being. I've also been fighting disordered eating patterns (never a diagnosed eating disorder, but probably should have been) since I was in middle school and have finally been making progress in that field over the past 3 years.

Today, my psychiatrist said he was ""concerned that [I've] gained some weight since [he] started seeing me"". And yes, some of my medications come with the risk of weight gain. But 15 pounds over almost 3 years isn't a whole lot considering I'm actually eating enough to nourish my body now.

I guess I'm just discouraged. It's like all they see is the weight and not the work I'm doing."
Neutral,"Need to vent a little  This is my first post on Reddit, so apologies to the mods in advance if I break any formatting or posting rules. 

I've been in recovery from disordered eating for 1.5 years, and as to be expected, my body has changed a bit. I still struggle with the changes occasionally, but for the most part I'm a much happier and healthier person now, and my husband is crazy supportive. However, I'm currently recovering from a surgery at home with my parents, who are not quite on the same page. I sent my husband back home to finish his degree and take care of our pets, so it's just the three of us for the next 5 weeks. 

I can already feel the friction; my parents really want me to be happy and healthy, but are just not quite up to date with how to best help me do that. I'm having some trouble with nausea and eating post-surgery, and I'm already hearing ""supportive/joking"" comments about how my parents wish they were on the same meds or needed surgery, and how they'll be so excited when I can get back to exercising. I don't want to snap at them, I know it's coming from a place of love, worry, and self-insecurity, but it's hard when I'm having disordered thoughts resurfacing less than a week after major surgery. Thinking about buying a copy of IE or Body Respect or something similar and leaving it around the house for them to pick up 😂

Anyways, I don't really know why I made this post, I think I just needed to vent a little somewhere supportive. I hope others are having an easier time with their body acceptance journey this week ❤️"

Neutral,"Revenge Body- A Toxic Concept  I hope this post is appropriate for this subreddit.  The concept of revenge body is not new at all.  I remember when Maury Povich used to *Maury* geek to chic episodes where people who were treated like shit in school because of how they looked would appear on *Maury* as exotic male dancers, attractive and busty women, or slender and transgender women and had guests who supported them, and sometimes guests who bullied them in the past.  (This was back in 2004, 2005, or even earlier).  

That's how I learned of the concept.  As someone who was made to feel like garbage in school and at home, I used to envision getting back at the people who mistreated me by showing up at my class reunion with the perfect body to make them feel the same way the way they made me feel.  That caused me to have an adverse relationship with food where I would eat a lot and then overexercise, and sometimes I would  eat very little and then splurge like crazy.  When I exercised, I would feel discouraged because my abs were not defined enough.  And that fed into the self-loathing I was already felt with.  My relationship with food improved as I began to accept my identity as a same gender loving person.

When it came time for my class reunion, I declined to attend.  It was one of the smartest moves I made in my 20s.

I can say without a doubt that the concept of revenge body is absolutely toxic.  It encourages reaching a size that is up to someone else's standards as opposed to your own.  The problem with that scenario arises when you show off your new body to someone and it doesn't make them feel bad, it doesn't make them apologize or even want you.  And now the motivation is gone.  

Another problem with this concept is that it is inherently fatphobic because it promulgates the idea that if someone is not ideal body material, then they are flawed and undesirable.  That is not conducive to body acceptance, rather it is antithetical."

Neutral,"Unsolicited Advice from a Doctor  I’ve been putting off going to a gyno for my Women’s Wellness exam for going on three years now. I finally got the courage to go in for one at a new doctor today. 

I went to this appointment to check on the wellness of my uterus and left with low self-esteem and a memory I’ll likely play on loop in my head for years to come.

The first thing this new doctor says to me is “you need to be 10-15 pounds lighter than you were when you started your medicine to go off of it” when I told her I was hopeful I could wean myself off Metformin for my PCOS. Fine. Okay. Got it.

Then, she’s examining my lower back as I’m butt-naked on the exam room table. She’s staring directly at my love handles. I can hear her thoughts of judgments in her breathing.

“You know, one thing you should consider for weight loss. Don’t eat anything after 6PM every night,” she advised (without my asking).

…I nod.

“And if you feel like eating after dinner. Just force yourself to go to sleep,” she literally laughs at her own extremely insulting joke.

…I nod again.

“And don’t eat carbs for dinner. You can eat carbs in the morning. But not at night.”

Okay. Cool. I didn’t realize I signed up to visit a TOTALLY INACCURATE AND UNQUALIFIED Nutritionist when I signed up for a papsmear.

Then she tells me to exercise 3x a week. I tell her I don’t like running and prefer taking walks. She says walking isn’t enough cardio for someone my age.

Thanks, Doctor. Got it.

She does the papsmear. She leaves.

YA’LL. This experience was so. damn. disappointing. When will Doctors learn that you can be fat and healthy? My blood panel results last year were 100% fine. No cholesterol issues, no diabetes, no thyroid concerns. My blood pressure today was 120/65 (normal). My cycle is normal. Everything about me is “normal” except for my weight and the way I look.

How do I handle this? I want to write this woman an email and screw her reputation on all of the Yelps. Her unsolicited, unhelpful, and inaccurate advice could trigger eating disorders on the daily in her patients. It was hurtful. It perpetuated an already exhausting battle I’ve been fighting with myself for 25 years. It validated every single person who has passed judgment on my body because of the way it looks because THIS person is in a place of medical and scientific power.

Help. The negative self-talk cycle has begun. Any advice is super appreciated."

Disordered,"Seeking women's perspective about body-positive yoga class  I'm an asexual, cisgender man of considerable size. I've recently been reading up on the Health At Every Size movement and it's inspired me to seek out body-positive, inclusive environments where I can be around others that model healthy habits. I'd really like to work on my flexibility and hopefully get some relief from the joint pain soreness I experience on a regular basis, so yoga seems like it might be a good fit. There are a few yoga classes in my area specifically geared toward larger folks and body-positivity. While they don't explicitly state ""women only,"" I've noticed that their online materials seem to strongly suggest that one of their main goals is to create a safe space for women. I've noticed the same thing with the HAES movement in general.

I am all for this. Women need safe, body-positive spaces. If that means not being around men, then I want to aid in that goal! My two main concerns are to support and affirm body positivity for all, while simultaneously finding a space in which I will be welcome. I hate the thought of inadvertently being and interloper and causing a woman in the room to feel unsafe. I'd love to get your perspective on this."

A few weeks ago, She told me I need to tone up because we have to go to a wedding soon. She also said that body positivity is bad and it's unhealthy. She says I'm overweight and I need to go to the gym or at least walk around. I ask ""What for?""

She gets mad and says ""For yourself, dumbass."" I went to my room to calm myself and my mom goes on about how her family has high blood pressure and high cholesterol and brings up dementia (???) She basically told me to don't let myself get any fatter because people are mean and it's not a good look to be fat.

...What's ironic is...She's 55 more pounds than me! She's  obese and has high blood pressure already.

Neutral,"New to body acceptance  Hi guys, 

i am pretty big (lol) and struggeling a bit with a lot of daily tasks. I wanted to ask the community for the best things under 100 dollars they have ever bought that have helped them in their daily life with being bigger. Thanks!"
Neutral,"The struggle to find flattering clothes that fit me  I am short with disproportionately large boobs, broad shoulders (broader than hips), no defined waist, don’t really have hips, short torso, I guess I have a bit of a bubble butt, always had a bit of a belly. My arms and legs are naturally toned.
I don’t really fall into any of common body types (pear, apple, triangle, hourglass, etc), but I guess I’m probably closer to apple with a bit of inverted triangle? Its hard to find fashion inspiration based on other women with similar body types because my body type is not common it seems. Buying clothes online is such a gamble because I need to try things on to see the fit. Using the size guide is kinda useless because only based on chest measurement I’m an XL and only based on hip measurement I’m a medium. Even when I try clothes in store, 90% of time it doesn’t look good. I feel like clothes are catered to fit tall, slim women. 

Over time, I have found clothes I absolutely avoid: Skinny jeans (makes me look to top heavy), baggy shirts (makes me look boxy), razor back tops (makes me look soo broad)

I have found these clothes to be more flattering;
Bell bottoms/flares (balances my top heaviness), fitted long sleeves with deep V (makes me look less broad and shows off my boobs).

I go through waves where I’m content and accepted my body and sometimes feelings of I wish I had a smaller waist and bigger butt, etc will creep (deleting instagram a year ago has helped lessen comparing my body to other!)  Anyways, this is more of a rant and seeing if anyone else relates with the struggle of finding flattering clothes for their shape. Also if you do have a similar shape, any styling tips?"
Neutral,"I love my body, or have at least accepted it, but others don’t.  I spent all of today looking for a dress for a wedding. It is fairly casual so I didn’t think it would be a problem, I was very wrong. I tried on about 20-30 dresses from different stores, and everything was either too small for my bust, or was “too chesty”. Every dress I was excited to put on slowly made me more and more disillusioned. 

The final straw for my day was a jump suit that I adored, it had slits down the sides of the jumpsuit and it meant I would go braless. I felt incredibly sexy, even though my stretch marks showed, my stomach rolled, and my chest sagged. When I looked at my shopping compatriots excitedly they immediately responded with how it was a shame this one had the openings on the side, or it would be cute otherwise.

I had to stay in the room for a while and cry, as I had fallen in love with how the jumpsuit made me look and feel. I had debated buying it anyway, but I knew I would never feel confident in it after their responses. I thought I had loved my body, but I felt myself wishing for the smaller body that would be able to wear a sexy jumpsuit and be called fashionable, rather than unacceptable.

How do you all deal with steps backwards on your self acceptance journey, when everybody else seems to want you to cover up in shame?"
Disordered,"Do you feel like you perceive your body differently based how you feel?  I don't just mean I'm kinder to myself. I struggle with my weight and the parts of my body I hate tend to be where I look the most ""fat"". When I'm depressed, I physically look larger and worse than when I'm in a good mood. When I'm in a good mood, I see myself the way a stranger would. I feel like I'm seeing myself for the first time and I realize I don't look bad at all, normal, even good. I wonder if this is how I *really* look.

I've noticed that I can't ""zoom out"" on how I see my body. The difference between how I look in the first scenario vs the second is that in the second, I'm seeing myself as a whole person.  I'm able to filter in both the good AND the less good parts of my body into one complete image. I usually can't create a complete image, I can only see the bad.

It's really weird, honestly. It's like my body image is fragmented. If one day I see myself as looking fine, it won't stick. The next day, I may know logically that the day before, I looked fine, and arguably today I look the same as I did yesterday, but I now think I look way worse and what I thought yesterday was not true.

It's just curious. I feel like this makes it much harder to accept my body because my body image is very unstable. I know logically that what I see could be either good or bad, it's entirely about the way my brain is perceiving it. "
Disordered,"Has anyone read ""Unbearable Weight"" by Susan Bordo?  I've just skimmed it because I'm bored at the library. I'm not good at reading at all and have a very short attention span but I enjoyed what I read and found it interesting in that it puts into words some concepts I've noticed around me in diet culture.

It brings up some very interesting points about diet culture, women's relationships to their body and how it relates to society as a whole. In the end, it forced me to look at how I relate to my own body and how it's linked to society's messaging about women and their roles.

It's a bit outdated (was written in the ~~90s~~ 80s), meaty and could be triggering to people struggling with an ED but if anyone's a nerd about this kind of stuff I would recommend!"
Disordered,"Tips for dressing a short waisted pear/hourglass body shape?   I'm pretty sure I'm between a pear and an hourglass. I have wide hips, saddlebags, chubby thighs and calves and my bra size is an 85C (european), so narrow back and breasts on the normal to kind-of-big side, but my waist is pretty short. Narrow but short. So I feel like most dressing tips for curvy body types don't apply to me, do any of you look like this or have any advice on dressing tips?"
Neutral,"can’t wear tops because of a mole  i have a mole/beauty spot and it’s not big or anything but not so small so it would go unnoticed, it’s on my arm cca 15 cm from my shoulder, in the front. i feel very ashamed of it, for no reason or whatsoever, i just personally don’t like them even if i know it’s not something someone can control. 

i feel so ashamed to the point i can’t wear short sleeved tops and in the summer it’s too hot, but even tho i can’t bring myself to feel good wearing short sleeves.

do you have any advice on how i could kinda accept it and be able to wear short sleeves?"
Neutral,"Called Chicken Wing by a strange teenager  Background - often struggled with weight
Often said to have a big belly but weight goes up and down

Went somewhere today and parked my car. I'm trying to get out carefully so I don't open the car door on the car next to me. Car had teenagers prob high school level. One of them says speed up chicken wing. I just gave the look and walked away but like damn. These kids nowadays are so impatient and rude. Not gonna lie it has been bothering me even though it's stupid.  Anyone experience that kind of stuff with kids these days? Why are they so disrespectful?"
Neutral,"Being insulted in order to compliment other women  Being lanky and flat means I’ve encountered so many instances in which men will say ”don’t worry we want something to hang on to ”, “no man actually likes skinny women”, “supermodels are average busty women are actually what we like”.

The honesty that they come out with affirming men don’t like our bodies is so depressing, it makes me think i’ll never find anyone to like me."
Neutral,"Body positivity for men  Hello, I'm a 23 year old man from Canada! First post on Reddit ever, hi.

I talked to my therapist this morning about my issues with my weight and how I perceive my body, and she suggested I look into body positivity online. However, there's basically close to nothing for men.

Mostly just about weight, not about the size of other things (lol).

Don't want to start a conversation about why there is less for men - **just looking for some body positivity media designed for men.** I don't identify as much to the ones meant for women.

I looked at the subreddit to make sure it wasn't already a subject, but didn't find much.

Big luv xx"
Neutral,"I'm unsubscribing from the beauty system  I've decided to unsubscribe from the beauty system, or in other words, I'm embracing body neutrality. 

I think body positivity is great and I love seeing all these amazing people rocking their bodies no matter shape, size, marks, imbalances etc. but it's just not for me. Body neutrality though, really resonates with me. If my organs aren't struggling to keep me going, and if I'm fit enough to do the activities I love then why should anything else matter? 

Unfortunately, unsubscribing from the beauty system is not as easy as hitting an unsubscribe button. Like all of us I've had years and years of media and society telling me I should want to look a certain way, I should want to be appealing to the opposite sex, and I should bend over backwards to achieve it.

But I'm going to work on it. No more changing my appearance for the sake of others, I'll do it if it's for myself. No more trying to hid my rolls when I'm wearing jeans. No more attempts to cover my stretch marks at the beach. 

My extra body fat is the result of the delicious food I've enjoyed that I am fortunate to have access to. My stretch marks are the result of a growth spurt when I was younger and is just a part of life. My scars are from being a care-free kid who climbed trees and when on adventures with friends. 

My extra body fat doesn't stop me from going on hikes. My stretch marks don't stop me from creating memories with friends. My scars don't stop me from loving the person I have become."
Neutral,"How to feel comfortable wearing a crop top with a large belly  I prepared several outfits including crop tops but then I realized that my belly makes me uncomfortable in them.  I even will wear mesh shirts underneath to cover up slightly, but I still feel uncomfortable.  Do I go the route of buying a corset?  I'm unsure of what to do to make me comfortable, and I don't want to give up on wearing crop tops because I feel like I would look sick'ning if I could just get comfortable."
Neutral,"Exercise Does Not Mean I Want to Lose Weight  I love hiking and low intensity workouts to help with my anxiety, but I'm not interested in losing weight. I just want to comfortably exist in the body I have. But when I exercise or download apps with exercises on them, they just make me feel so unhappy with myself. The instructors talk about ""burning fat"" and ""how much weight you'll lose"". I just want either a body neutral or body positive exercise that doesn't demonize this body I live in. My body is amazing! And I'm tired of fitness instructors trying to get me to feel bad about myself.

I'm moving into an apartment with a 24/7 gym, and I was excited to try out the stair climbing (the repetition is weirdly calming for me) or start weight training. But I've just become more and more anxious about facing body negativity from the other gym goers. As anyone else experienced something like this? How did you handle it?"
Neutral,"Clothing Recommendations?  So, in the past 2 years, I've experienced a significant drop in my weight due to surgery. I thought that I would be more comfortable in my skin, more confidently express myself (via clothing and in general), but now I'm overwhelmed by the options that I previously had limited to no access to. In a way, the extremely limited options made me work on developing distinct styles for every season that looked ""presentable"" according to my (convoluted) standards (I struggled with an ED way before I had my surgery, the surgery's effect on my weight and body image is a conversation for another day). I don't want to dress the way I used to anymore? I want to dress in a way that reflects what I find aesthetically appealing, which is much harder than I thought, because I feel like I forgot how to feel like something appeals to me! I say ""forgot"" because it feels like a distant feeling I would get as a kid that I grew up having to repress because I rarely would find my size. Does anyone have any recommendations for how to get through this and just dress nicely? 

I hope I'm making sense."
Neutral,"Upcoming wedding causing a lot of body anxiety  A few years ago I started on my journey of healing my relationship with my body and with food and movement. Overall it’s been going well and I have a lot of support - therapist, partner, great friends.

During this healing journey my body has gotten larger, which I have been making peace with as I go.

However, with my wedding now less than 5 months away I am struggling to stay neutral and accepting and I find myself wanting to fall into old restrictive habits.

I have not gone down that road and have enough support not to. But my mindset and emotions seem to be getting stuck in fear about not looking or feeling pretty on our wedding day.

I know that is a result of diet culture and such, I know it’s just programming, but it’s gripping me hard.

Has anyone been through this? What helped you to enjoy the experience rather than get stuck in this painful mindset?  Thank you!"
Neutral,"Where to go for more body acceptance online?  I have gone without loving my body for too long and I'm trying to ""detoxify"" my online spaces, replacing negative spaces with positive ones. Aside from this specific subreddit, I don't really have any body positive things that I can regularly see and read about, etc. 

Keeping in mind that I don't want to re-download Facebook or Instagram (so specific pages or figures on those apps wouldn't be the best suggestions for me), where should I go online to this end?"
Neutral,"Putin  So I've heard and read many comments about Putin's height (apparently it's 5'7"") and his presumed penis size (small, as you can imagine) in these past couple of weeks. Of course this is jokingly mentioned as reasons for his actions - you know, some guys buy big cars, others invade countries, ha-dee-ha. I gotta say, I really, really hate this bs. Just goes to show how normalized bodyshaming is, among men and women, against men and women. As a guy on the smaller side, you probably have no idea just how incredibly common such comments are. You basically hear them every day.

This is toxic af and it needs to be addressed more."
Neutral,"Creating positive correlations  I've often strongly correlated being ""skinny"" with being a ""good person."" I've placed such an importance on my weight as being the end all to my worth as a person. For example, if I'm overweight, i must be a bad person. Has anyone else experienced something similar? What was helpful to change that type of thinking?"
Neutral,"Neighbor told me to cover myself up  We're in Florida. It was hot. I was in our fenced in backyard doing yard work in skorts and a sports bra, finished up, saw the trash needed to go out, threw on a flannel and took it to the bin. Next door neighbor decided, instead of just keeping his mouth shut, to tell me to have some respect and cover up.

In the moment I told him I'm a grown woman and he's got no right to speak to me like I'm a child, but later I reflected he's got no right to even speak to a child like that. It was just disgusting all around, and has made me feel uncomfortable stepping into my own front yard.

I think what I'm most upset about is the small part of myself that feels like I did make a mistake, and I should've made myself more ""decent"" before stepping into the front yard for 15 seconds. I see guys mowing their yards with no shirt on all the time and no one bats an eye, but my body has to be policed and commented on, even in my own space.

I feel like I can't be safe or comfortable anywhere."
Neutral,"How to support friends with body image issues  Hi. I don’t even know if this could even be the right sub (and feel free to redirect me if you think there could be a more appropriate sub to post this on). But I have a very close friend who has severe body image issues, and sometimes turns to me while feeling negatively about herself (eg. weight gain, or clothes suddenly not fitting, etc.). I have a myriad of other self-esteem and self-image issues, but my body hasn’t really been one of them for a while. 
I can often empathize with her on a more general sense, from my own BDD experience, for example (after all, I’d suspect we’re all very much affected by beauty standards, in some way or another). But there are things, especially related to weight fluctuation (I think the best way to describe my own relationship to my body might be ‘neutrality’), that I sometimes do not feel like I can really fully understand. Even if I try, and listen in the best way that I can. And I often feel very out of place and unequipped while trying to support her on this topic. Ending up feeling like a very shitty friend. 

I really love my friends, and I would like to have a better understanding of how to be more supportive in this kind of situations. It’s happened enough times that I, again, feel like I cannot fully be there for them in the ways that they might need. 

Would anyone happen to have any tips on how I can really show up, and support friends, when it comes to weight/body image issues?"

Disordered,"TW: ED recovery  Hi friends, just joined because I hit a milestone today in my recovery process and wanted to share. (For context, I’ve been 5 years recovered!)
 I always had a fear of exercise, and specifically exercising in front of people. I was always worried about what people would think of me, my body, and my level of fitness. I avoided it for so long bc of bad experiences pre-recovery, and had definite concerns about how to do it in a healthy way post-recovery. 
Today I worked out for the first time in years. I worried what people would think of my body, I looked around to see if anyone was looking at me, but ultimately I kept in mind that it didn’t matter if they were. My stomach was out, I was wearing a sports bra, and I was definitely self conscious, but I actually saw another girl in the gym with my exact same body type! It felt great to see someone else with their stomach rolls visible, working hard and not caring. I kept thinking to myself the things I learned from body positivity. It made me feel more confident, more sure of myself, and I left feeling happy and proud. 
I worked out because I wanted to move and get endorphins and energy! I moved in ways that felt good, and stopped when they were too much for me. I’m looking forward to trying again and seeing how far I can go. Just really proud of myself today."

Neutral,"How can I help my 8yr old sister  For context: My family is very skinny, my Mum is skinny, my other sister is skinny, I'm very skinny. We are just naturally really really thin, to the point that it would be considered unhealthy for anyone else. 

My littlest sister though is not skinny, she's definitely not overweight, just normal. But for a while now she has been making little comments now and then about her weight. Like just earlier, she came to me and said:

""I'm wearing a crop top""

Me: ""mmmmm"" (I was in the middle of playing chess)

Her: ""It's supposed to be for other girls who are skinny, so I just have to keep my arms down like this"" (she put her arms tightly by her side so that her belly wasn't showing)

Me: ""crop tops aren't just for skinny people, why should only skinny people wear them?""

Then she just said idk and changed the subject. She's only 8 but she has been making comments like this for a while now. I really don't want her to get older and develop an eating disorder or something, I just want her to know how beautiful she already is and that she doesn't need to be stick thin to be pretty. I've tried talking to my mum about it before, but I think my sister has learnt it all from my mum. My mum is pretty skinny for a 45yr old, especially since she has birthed 4 children. But she constantly makes remarks about herself being fat and she keeps trying to go on diets. I forgot what she said when I talked to her about my sister but I do remember that she didn't think about it much, because to her generation, you do need to be skinny to be pretty. 

Basically I just need advice on how I can help my sister to know that weight and size don't matter and to love herself and her body as she is. Because lots of the time I don't really know what to say. My sister hates conflict so whenever someone suggests a different opinion she kind of just shrugs or ignores you and goes quiet."

Neutral,"Help with liking my skinny body  I've been working for the past few months to have a better relationship with my body. I deal with pretty debilitating anxiety on a daily basis and thought this may be a large contributor to my poor-self esteem. So, I've been working on being more mindful of my thought processes and consciously redirecting negative ones in a more positive direction. I asked my therapist to help with this because I couldn't figure out how to make that work with thoughts about my body. She has trouble with the topic sometimes but, she gave me a list of positive affirmations to say every day about myself.

However, I would like to add some about my body specifically. I've always been a thin, rectangular shaped girl. It's been the source of a lot of bullying and ridiculing over the years. I never felt like I could be feminine or desired because of it. It's a part of me that I see every day, and I don't want to act like it doesn't exist. After looking on the internet to try and find mantras/positive affirmations for thin bodies, I realized there weren't any.

So, I was wondering if anyone here could help me come up with any (or direct me to some)? Possibly give some tips to help me along this journey of loving my body? I don't want to dislike myself because im skinny."

Neutral,"16F I look like a 12 year old boy  Whilst I don’t mind looking androgynous (some of my icons are androgynous and the fashion is pretty cool) I don’t want to look like a boy.

I’ve been called the T-Slur a couple times on the street, and my friends little brother recently asked her if I was transgender. I have no issue with anyone who is trans and accept it, but I’m a cis girl and want to be a girl. 

I usually wear my hair short ish (just above shoulder) because it looks good on me that way, and I wear trousers to school instead of the skirt (I have uniforms). I don’t always wear makeup because I’m lazy, and I must admit I have a boyish figure. I’m skinny with narrow hips and I’m pretty flat. 

I used to like my body a lot and thought I was always pretty attractive but recently I’ve just been feeling too manly. 

I’ve also been thinking of romance a lot, and I really want to have a bf/gf one day, but I wonder if anyone will even be attracted to me. I look super young, I’m small and flat and APPARENTLY look like a little boy so who the hell is even going to be attracted to me? Pedophiles? 

I don’t even want to change myself or the way I dress, I just wish people would see me as a girl or at least androgynous rather than a guy. Hell, call me a tomboy I don’t care."

Neutral,"I’m my boyfriends first chubby girlfriend.  I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (28M) for nearly a year now. I have severe body image issues from my past relationship and i spent a long time healing from that. I felt like I was ready for a relationship, and things were going really great. 

Up until recently, i found a secret instagram account filled with ig models (i used his phone to see how my professional ig looked to someone viewing it and he was logged in to that account). It crushed me, honestly. I spent days comparing myself before finally confronting him. He felt immediate embarrassment and grief. He deleted the account but then i realized he has never dated a bigger girl. 

We have no issue in our sex life. But i really can’t accept the fact that he’s attracted to me. Because I’ve seen what he likes. He tells me that he likes all body types and as someone who has recovered from an ED and still i guess have severe body image issues, i don’t believe him. He only ever looks/looked at very skinny models/SWers. I saw the following and there wasn’t one not even close to midsize woman on there 

I’m feeling very defeated and truly feel like he’s only with me to get over his previous toxic relationship. I know it’s been a year, but it sucks a lot to feel like he’s just lying to me when I feel like he prefers a body type that isn’t mine. He’s perfect to me. Sorry if this rant/seeking advice was all over the place I’m mentally a wreck right now.

Edit: to add i have 2 kids. Mom bod to the max. Deflated breast, kangaroo pouch so it sucks even more to see what i think he prefers/likes more than my body :/"

Neutral,"Nan called me fat, please send help  I've been on a journey to try and love myself just how I am, for weeks now I've felt amazing. 
I went shopping with my Nan today, I was on the hunt for some mom type jeans, found a great pair, tried them on, felt cute af and then she walks over and says ""I don't like them, they make you look fat""
I'm probably more upset than I should be, and I feel like I can't even explain to her like ""body positivity / acceptance"" because shes been brainwashed by society to think if you're not a size 2 then you need to lose weight, in fact she, a 78 year old woman, is always talking about how she needs to lose weight (she doesn't, shes healthy). 

Anyways, I don't know where I'm going with this, just needed to vent/get it off my chest/get some sort of support 
Thanks ❤️"
Neutral,"The Mr. Beard Fatphobia video is making me feel things (rant-ish)  So I really like the YouTuber Mr. Beard. He’s a really nice and reasonable person and I relate to him a lot as someone who is also fat and nonbinary. He does an excellent job discussing various topics imo. But recently he talked about the stress of being stuck in between fatphobia and body positivity and it’s had me thinking a lot lately.

I really do feel like I’m stuck in this slingshot between self love and self hate. Like I don’t want to hate myself and I also don’t feel like it’s possible to constantly love myself. I want to feel good about how I look- I put effort into my appearance, I dress in a way I like, I dye my hair how I want, I try to present myself in a way I aesthetically enjoy, so I want to enjoy when I feel like I look good. At the same time I’m terrified of being this delusional fat person that people are making fun of. I don’t even know if I count as fat per se- I’m 5’8 and size 16. I feel like I’m in this weird middle space sometimes with my body where I don’t know what category I’d fit in. 

But sometimes I see the awful things people say about fat people and it makes me question everything about myself. Am I lying to myself? Am I slowly killing myself? The last time I went to the doctor I was perfectly healthy. I have no issues with mobility or anything like that. And I still get super scared that by not being skinny I’m like, ruining my health (which is so dumb bc like, so many things affect your health and my health is nobody’s business but mine unless I wanna share). But I see like awful caricatures of fat people and all I can think is, do people see me like that? Do people look at me and mentally remove intelligence and worthiness from their impression of me based on my size?

Then, on the other hand, body positivity sounds so good, but I really struggle to relate to the mainstream body positivity movement lately. It feels, to an extent, hyper feminine and hyper sexual. I have participated in this in the past and it’s not inherently bad but I don’t like that it’s the focus (in my opinion). I’m transmasc and my goal in life is not to be a fuckable woman. And the mainstream body positive movement does sort of feel like it focuses a lot on sex appeal of fat women. Like yeah obviously most people want to be sexually desired by others sometimes but it really bothers me that it’s such a focus. Like to fit in with mainstream body positivity I have to put on a full face of makeup and a dress and then I’m a bad bitch or whatever. I don’t like certain parts of my body that would make me more appealing in a mainstream way. And I don’t really feel supported by the rhetoric I see on, like, instagram, about fat AFAB people and how we can still be sexy.

I’m not sure if this all makes sense- but like, the video made me think about how at the end of the day I really just want to be treated like a person without any preconceptions based on my body size. And I want to like myself without my body size being a factor. I’m tired of feeling like I have to be thin, and if I’m not thin I should be sexy and feminine. Or if I work out I’m somehow disappointing all other fat people. But if I don’t work out I’m a piece of shit, even though thin people who don’t work out don’t get any flack. I don’t know. I’m just so deeply frustrated with like, being perceived. I just want to like myself!"

Neutral,"I've mentally turned my ""before"" pictures into just pictures, and I'm really happy with them  Sorry for the long post, but bear with me😅

A little over a week ago I decided to sign up for this ""get fit in 30 days"" challenge because I was (and still am but I'm working on it) so unhappy with how I look and my fairly recent weight gain. The first day of the challenge you're supposed to take your ""before"" pics so you can see the progress.
It's only been a week of it, but this challenge very quickly turned into me working out daily for a week, beating myself up mentally when I couldn't do all the reps and follow along, and criticizing myself everytime I ate something remotely unhealthy. Ive been heading down this road for a while, trying to force myself to work out 7 days a week and hating myself when I missed a day, and then feeling absolutely destroyed when I didn't lose any weight. I've just been so exhausted with all of this.

Today I looked at my before pictures and went to delete them, but then looked again and decided that before pictures are stupid. I don't need a ""before"", I just need to let myself be. There is no before or after, it's all just me and they're just pictures of me. I stopped looking at the parts I was hoping would change in the after, and started looking at the parts I like in the now. 

I know it's not much, but it just felt like a huge mindset shift and I'm really proud of myself.

I don't need to change my body. I don't need an after, and I certainly don't need to overwork myself for some stupid challenge."

Neutral,"I could accept my body a lot more if there was actually clothing I could find that I like and also that actually fit me. I wear plus size clothing and I'm short. Plus I'm somewhat of a tom boy. Most items of clothing that actually fit are unflattering on me or I just despise the style.  My weight fluctuates a lot and the last couple of years I've been going back between a size 18 and 20, but mostly it's been size 20. Most clothing stores don't have items (in any size) that really work with my body very well, I don't know if I just have an unusual type of body or what. I want to accept my body, but a major part of the reason I have a hard time doing so is bc there are a lot more options in size 18 clothing that I like and that fit well enough, but with size 20 it's such an excrutiating and time consuming process to even find 1 item I don't despise. I'd say that to find 1 item of clothing fits and that I like, it takes trying on about 10 differnt items when I'm a size 18, and about 50 different items when I'm a size 20 just to find 1 item I don't despise. I'm not exaggurating at all. It's very, very rare I can find something in a size 20 that fits that I at least semi like. I suffer from deep depression and have a lot of health issues, so often don't have the energy or motivation to go through the whole aggrivating and time consuming process of finding new clothing when I wear size 20, so I end up wearing the same thing over and over until they're too raggedy to wear. I'm way more confident and happy when I'm a size 18 since I can wear clothing I like and feel good in and my depression and self esteem go down a lot when I'm a size 20 and have to wear clothing I can just tolerate. I could accept my body MUCH more if this weren't the case. 

People have suggested getting clothing tailored, which could be an option if I had more money, but that could get expensive. I rarely buy new clothing as it, and even when I do I can barely even afford it bc I'm unemployed right now and can barely even afford my month to month expenses. Just to give you an idea, some of places I go to (in person and online) are Kohl's, Torrid, Old Navy, Target, sometimes Walmart. I also go to used clothing stores and look for items on ebay and poshmark. 

It's just so frustrating bc I always think that if I could just get down to a size 18 again then I wont have to deal with all of this as much and can wear clothing I feel good, comfortable and confident in. But I also want to be able to accept my body however big/small it is. But it is what it is, I just can't seem to stop getting into the diet mentality and it's not even really about my body actually, it's about having clothing I feel good in. 

So, my options seem limited and I'm not sure if anyone has any suggestions, but I thought I'd try. Also, just in case I come into some money any time in the near future, if anyone has any suggestions on other options where I don't have to stick to as strict of a budget, then that would be good to know for future reference. 

Thanks!"

Disordered,"Words of wisdom  Hi there! I wrote some words of wisdom (which is a senior tradition in my sorority) about body acceptance, and I really want to share them with a wider audience and thought this sub would be a good place! here goes..

**M's Declassified Body Positivity Survival Guide**

Trigger warning, I will obviously be talking about body image and will briefly mention eating disorders so if this is something that will make you uncomfortable please feel free to click away

To launch into this, I want to ask, has your body image ever stopped you from doing anything ever?  From wearing a cute top that you like, to having a yummy snack, to feeling confident enough to walk up and talk to someone? Can you imagine how much joy you’ve missed out on because you have been limiting your actions based on something that doesn’t ACTUALLY affect how you are allowed to curate your lived experience? You all deserve to live your life joyously and unconstrained by insecurity, so here are my top 10 tips on body positivity.

1. You don’t give a fuck about anyone else, so no one gives a fuck about you.
   1. Do you ever walk down the corner and worry that you look stupid? Do you realize that a lot of other people are also actually worrying about that for themselves at the same time? Take solidarity in this shared lived experience and realize that everyone is too concerned with themselves to be concerned with what you look like or what you are doing. I’m sure the amount of times you walk down the corner and mentally compliment someone is far greater than the amount of times you mentally judge someone. 
2. If you can love others, why can’t you love yourself?
   1. If you can look at someone else and decouple their worth from how their body looks, why can’t you do that for yourself? 
   2. I’m sure you find people of all shapes and sizes different from your own beautiful. I’m sure you find people with the exact same body type as yours beautiful. You deserve to afford yourself the same grace and aesthetic appreciation as you would afford literally anyone else.  
3. Consider how the beauty industry is founded in capitalism
   1. All traditional beauty companies in the market really want is to manipulate your perception of yourself so that they can convince you to buy things and profit off of your insecurity. 
   2. Have you ever developed an insecurity or worry that you didn’t even have until an advertisement told you that you should have it? Imagine how much better our lives would be if we weren’t constantly bombarded by advertisements related to the beauty industry. The beauty industry is built on comparison and the bet that what they show is something that you wish you could have 
   3. Think critically about how advertisements are trying to make you wish you were different, just so they can sell you something. Often, they are attempting to convince you that what they sell to you  an ideal reality when they really they just sell a product you will waste your money on and actually will make you feel worse about yourself
   4. The capitalistic beauty industry also needs change in order to push new products and continue to make money. This is why beauty standards are constantly changing. The fact that beauty standards are constantly changing also is great proof that every moment you spend trying to shape yourself and your image in a certain way that is deemed attractive can so quickly go to waste as soon as the trend changes, so you might as well just learn to love the body you have now. 
4. Remember that everything is not as it seems 
   1. \*Cue the wizards of Waverly place soundtrack\*
   2. SOCIAL MEDIA AND ADVERTISEMENTS ARE SO EASILY MANIPULATED, AND MANIPULATED SO WELL THAT IT SEEMS REALISTIC THESE DAYS 
   3. However, so few of the images put out in the market by large corporations are un-retouched. 
   4. Trust nothing, be critical. 
   5. Remember this especially when scrolling through social media as high quality retouching is accessible to everyone now with face-tune 
   6. On that note, I highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend weaning yourself off of face-tune. Enhancing colors and brightness in photos is fine, but fundamentally changing something about your body through editing and filters is damaging to your own self image as well as the mindsets of those who consume your content. 
   7. Speaking of social media…
5. diversify your feed
   1. Intentionally follow people that look like you, follow people that don’t look like you on both ends of the spectrum
   2. In all ways, including in the bodies you see 
      1. Race, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, size!
   3. I also think it is important to de-aspirational your feed
      1. Do not follow “fit-spiration” accounts 
      2. Do not follow people that you only follow out of envy 
      3. Spending hours on social media scrolling through images of what you wish you were does nothing but hurt your self image.
   4. I think this is a good place to mention men’s body positivity and the double standards surrounding them is something to consider when orienting yourself in the world of body positivity. I also think it is important to acknowledge that people with gender differences and dysphoria have varying levels of body-image related issues as well and that this is not just a straight-white-female problem.
6. Analyze the decisions you’re making in relation to your body 
   1. Are you working out because it makes you feel good and will help you live longer, or are you working out to look a certain way? 
   2. Are you choosing it because it will fuel your body in the way that you need it to, as well as taste yummy, or are you choosing a certain snack or meal because it will change how your body looks?
   3. Are you putting on that outfit because you like it and it expresses your tastes, or are you putting it on because it shapes your body to fit a certain popular beauty standard
   4. Looking more deeply into these decisions can help you better understand how to dismantle your own negative self perception and tendencies. 
7. Physically treat your body with kindness 
   1. Instead of pinching or rubbing or poking at the parts of your body that you don’t like, when was the last time you lovingly and tenderly touched them? Physical actions can help shape our thoughts 
   2. Do not wear tight and uncomfortable clothes for any longer than you truly want to! Take that bra off when you get home! Peel yourself out of those jeans! 
   3. Speaking of clothes, clothes are made to fit your body, you do not need to make your body fit the clothes. You do not need to lose weight to be worthy of wearing any type of clothing. Do not hold onto clothing that no longer fits in the hope for motivation to change. Do not buy clothing as motivation to change. Buy and keep what fits now. 
   4. Rest when you need rest. If you think working out is beyond your mental energy scope for the day, then it is ok to skip a day. Muscles are not built overnight, nor are they lost overnight. 
   5. Eat when you are hungry. So often boys are encouraged to eat a lot when they are young because they are “growing boys” but women are introduced to diet culture at a scary young age through the media. Food is essential for survival. Beyond that, food is a source of joy. You need to eat. You are allowed to eat for joy, not just for survival.
   6. Thank your body for everything that it has done for you. This is the only one you get. Thank her for every happy experience she has allowed you to participate in, and thank her for every hard one that she has carried you through. Your body is your ally, not your enemy. 
8. Raise your standards, lower your expectations for everyone, including yourself
   1. This piece of advice I mostly apply to dating and relationships and I could do a whole words of wisdom on this alone, but also can apply to your relationship with your body 
   2. If you wouldn’t let your best friend talk a certain way about your body, why would you let yourself? Would you go back in time and say the nasty things you say to your younger self?
   3. Also be kind to yourself on your body positivity journey. It is its own version of a mindfulness practice. notice the negative automatic thoughts, identify what they are and where they are coming from, and correct them, and thank yourself for choosing to be kind to yourself. These thought habits have been built over two whole decades and will take time to dismantle and reassemble. Like Ikea furniture.
9. On a serious note, Seek professional help if you think you need it
   1. Disordered eating is a serious issue and everyone struggling with it deserves love, compassion, and help. If you think you are struggling with disordered eating, please seek professional help
10. IF BODY POSITIVITY SEEMS TOO FAR OUT OF YOUR REALM, GO FOR BODY NEUTRALITY 
   1. Body neutrality is often defined as the idea that you can exist without having to think too much about your body one way or another, positive or negative. You can simply exist and be worthy of respect without thinking about your body at all.
   2. I personally think both body positivity and neutrality can and should be practiced in unison
   3. This also is important as it is important to decouple your worth and anyone’s worth from their body and relationship with it
   4. Your body is the least interesting thing about you. You are a strong, smart, talented, vivacious, interesting person on your own, and how you look has exactly ZERO bearing on that. 
   5. In contrast to that, there is a forced separation we so often create between mind and body. The body is not just a vessel for your thoughts, it is your conduit for your lived experience, it is how you interact with the world. Be grateful for YOU, but also realize that the aesthetic aspects of your body should not shape your relationship with it.  
   6. A final question on this note.. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life unhappily chasing a standard rather than accepting the body that you live in? This is not to guilt you for wanting to change, but I think provides some perspective on what is truly important in life.

I’ll conclude by saying this– body positivity and/or body neutrality is hard. So hard. I am still unlearning the toxicity shoved into our brains over our whole lives. Every day is a struggle. But every day is a chance to fight to love yourself, because you deserve it. You deserve to wear that crop top or tight dress, you deserve to get that ice cream on a hot summer’s day, you are a damn catch and any friend or romantic interest would be lucky to have you, and you deserve to go through life without constantly being weighed down by constant awareness and negative perceptions of your body. Go confidently, and be kind to yourself, and be kind to your body."

Ok so, I don't know if anybody else has ever felt this way but recently when i go on about my day without having my bra on or whatever, i can almost ""feel"" my breast. It drives me crazy. Like I can clearly feel its weight etc. Given that I have medium-sized boobs (C cup), this felt very strange, but I'm asking for reassurance for clarifying if this is a normal experience. Maybe It's a hormonal shift making me feel more aware of it? I'm kind of clueless."

It's gotten much better since then but I still don't do a lot of things like date or wear lots of things because of my discomfort with myself. I do get compliments but I'm totally unable to accept them, mentally. I just invalidate them automatically. I can't \*make\* myself believe them bc it almost feels like I'm lying to myself.

Then, a friend of mine reassured me, let's say his name is M, that there are guys like M who like girls with smaller boobs, and then the first guy said ""yeah, guys who surf, because she's like a board"" and everyone started laughing again. I felt so uncomfortable. The topic was quickly changed after that but I still feel bad.

Neutral,"Nose tip and middle of lips misaligned(Misaligned philtrum)?  So the other day while looking in a mirror, I noticed that the little groove in the middle of my lips and the tip of my nose don't line up. I measured it with a ruler and it doesn't seem to be a lot when you bring it down to numbers(around 4 millimeters) but to me it looks like a lot.  


The thing is, scrolling through social media and looking at the faces of my friends/people I follow, I feel like I've never seen this on anybody else.

Neutral,"The harm that exists in boiling people down to their weight and appearance through ""compliments"" and weight discussion.  \[TW: Weight Loss and Hurtful Comments\] 

Mods, please remove if this is in violation of rules in any way. 

Right now, I can confidently say that I am not in a good place regarding my mental health. Lately, I have been really reflecting on how I got here. I have been asking myself how I lost touch with the imperfect, but secure, confident, joyful person I once was. I have been fighting to get back in touch with her.

In late 2019, I made a few changes WITHOUT the intention of changing my body. I was in an excellent, self-care oriented headspace, and I ended up losing a noticeable amount of weight. I didn't even notice this or think about it, just carried on as per usual. A turning point occurred when people around me began noticing and reacting openly. First, it was light ""compliments"" on the weight loss. I was surprised to hear these compliments, and relatively unaffected by them, and I would move on quickly. 

As time went on and the loss continued (not on purpose), the topic of the change in my body began to dominate my interactions with my friends and loved ones. People would go on and on in a way that made me feel very uncomfortable and objectified. Everyone would be standing around me, asking me ""how I did it"", what ""diet"" was I on, what was my secret? Making terrible comments about their own weight and comparing their own bodies to mine. Some of the ""positivity"" and ""compliments"" took a really ugly turn, and my weight loss was announced to everyone in a room as something everyone should congratulate me on. Some of it turned really dark and sour. More than once, I had the same individuals telling me that I was now too skinny, and people musing on whether or not I had an eating disorder right in front me. It was crushing. I was pushed to the point of tears a few times. 

More than anything else, it started a habit of fixating on myself and my appearance in a way that I NEVER had before. I began to feel the crushing insecurity and obsession with my physical appearance that I am now plagued with. These things truly had never even crossed my mind pre-2019. I took joy in my hobbies and interests and truly lived in the moment. 

The ""compliments"" and commentary on my weight loss boiled me down to my appearance, when I was and still am SO much more than that. Right now, I am trying so hard to dig myself out of this hole I am in and get back in touch with the version of myself that brought me the most joy. I really think that we have got change the dialogue surrounding weight loss and the commentary and compliments that follow weight loss. It has hurt me so deeply."

Neutral,"Triggered by a post on another subreddit  TW: weight discussion, eating disorder

This is my first time posting here, so I hope I’m doing it right/not breaking any rules. I just saw a post on another subreddit that was filled with comments judging a young girl’s weight. Apparently it’s okay to bash a teenager on the internet now (I guess that’s really nothing new when it comes to fatphobia)? The commenters must surely have all been MDs with all the medical advice they were giving (she’s “likely on her way to diabetes”, etc.). I found one comment that I agreed with saying a child shouldn’t be dieting (according to much research on weight, health, and eating disorders, no one should really be dieting — dieting is literally considered disordered eating by experts in the field [I studied under one]), but of course once they heard about the girl’s exact BMI (BMI is not at all a good predictor of health if you look at the academic research!) they made an edit to say “actually, yes, they should be on a diet”. 

Anyways, sorry about the angry rant. The reason I think this has me so worked up is because I used to have an eating disorder and when I recovered my weight went up pretty drastically to what some would consider “overweight” (not a great term to use, but alas if you’re over society’s expectation for weight that’s what you’re considered). This is of course to be expected — I was anorexic for years, my set weight went up after that, and some people’s set weights are where I am without having an eating disorder for years. Of course I got tons of opinions and “expert” advice from my family about how I should lose weight when my weight first went up (now people know that if they talk to me about my weight in any kind of negative way I will literally walk away in the middle of the conversation — yay for boundaries!). Recently due to stress, depression, and vomiting (often multiple times a day) due to anxiety attacks, I’ve lost some weight pretty rapidly. It’s really not ideal at all, and I’m worried that when I see myself becoming thinner I may fall into old “habits” (not eating or purging). I feel like no one cares/everyone thinks it’s good that I’m losing weight, which it really isn’t. So now I think I’m a little more sensitive to weight stuff right now, hence the rant.

Anyways, if you took the time to read this, thank you. If anyone has any words of encouragement as well, I would happily accept them."

Neutral,"How to deal with harsh comments from your own mother?  I was about to post here yesterday, but even after reading through the rules I somehow managed to break one of them - apologises for that. ❤️ Let's try again.

I am looking for tips on how to deal with some harsh comments from your family. I'm 31F and in some sort of a crisis with my mother, who is just not understanding my point _at all_. We've just had a massive argument over MY BODY, as I have ONCE AGAIN, told her that she is not allowed to comment on my weight or appearance.

I think I kind of lost it today when she posted the same old stuff to our family WhatsApp group. Sending me just another link to join an online diet plan, this time in front of the whole family. I've been through this same thing with her so many times throughout my life. I now finally told her that I believe this has all started in my childhood. I said I don't want to blame her because her intentions have been good... But it's impossible to ignore the fact that my experiences in childhood has affected my relationship with food, my confidence and mental health. And this has now hurt her feelings and she is accusing me for blaming her on the situation.

Basically, I've always been pushed to join diets and lose weight. My mom made me join Weight Watchers when I was 16 (the age limit is 18 but they allowed me in). After that, I tried multiple different diets - aaand always failed. Obviously. Always left me feeling like a failure. And my mom always reminds me of it. Comments about my weight and how I need to do something about it. And it always hurts, and she knows it. When I lived abroad, she used to send me stuff by mail and the parcel always had a weightloss article in it. I can't do it any longer. What I want, is to work on my fucked up relationship with food - but how can I do it when my own mom just won't stop doing this?! 

My family is the best really, I had a lovely childhood etc - but this has left me scarred. And I would like to think that they only mean good which is what makes this difficult. I've tried to explain to mom how much it hurts and that her comments don't help at all  - but she doesn't get it. Her final argument is always: ""But it's a health risk"". This time she said that the only thing to help me will be a surgery if I don't diet well enough. 

How would you deal with this? It's my body, it's my life, I'm 31 FFS. And I still feel so awful. Been down to the Memory Lane today and gosh it hurts. I hope this all made sense, my brain is so foggy today."

Neutral,"People should really stop commenting on others’ body  I (28F) just put a picture of me in high school (age 14-15) on my fb story. Someone who just saw me a month ago made this comment underneath: “You lost a lot of weight 👏🏻👏🏻”

The funniest part (or tragic depending on one’s point of view) is that I’m not even anything like what i looked like in that photo. I had very long blonde hair then, now I have a pixie cut. My face obviously, and inevitably, changed a lot since my adolescent years. But this person who looked at that picture didn’t even bother to notice that the ‘woman’ she saw a month ago can’t possibly be that girl in that picture. Instead she directly looked at how my weight changed and decided to compliment me on that aspect which turned out to be an insult since it’s obviously the other way around. And of course this well-meant remark added to the list of body-shamings I’ve been subjected to since I gained a bunch of weight this past year.

The bottom line is that even when a compliment is the intended outcome it’s not a good idea to comment on people’s weight or any other physical features. Because you never know when you might unintentionally hurt feelings. Also it’s not our job to put a label to what others look like. It’s just presumptuous…"

Using the term “mid-size” is the only way I can find content online that matches my body type. I would have thought I’m plus size, but clothes at the plus size store are too big, yet clothes at the regular stores are too small, so I feel like I’m in an awkward middle spot where it’s hard to find clothes that fit, and because of this I’d now say I’m “mid-size”, but now this post circulating is saying it’s a fat phobic term?

Neutral,"Partners family is so judgmental of our bodies  [TW: discussion of ED/weight] This is a long one, I apologize, but I need some advice. So my partner (27M) and I (25F) are home visiting his family for the holidays and it has been lovely aside from one constant looming issue, his dad and step mom are extremely pushy and judge mental of our weight/bodies/food choices/exercise habits. Since our arrival it has been brought up multiple times a day every day. 

For some background, my partner and I are overweight but just do not prioritize weight loss in our lives right now. I have a history of severe disordered eating and have worked extremely hard to get to the other side and feel comfortable in my every day life. My partner’s step mom has an active eating disorder and is extremely restrictive and strict about what she’s “allowed” to eat (the woman brings her own dressing to restaurants because she doesn’t trust the dressings available there) and his dad has picked up a lot of these behaviors as well and is obsessed with talking about weight loss and how good/bad foods are. 

Since we have arrived they have skipped at least one meal a day (usually both breakfast and lunch), banned Christmas cookies and dessert from the house, skipped Christmas dinner (we had a plain pork tenderloin and steamed broccoli instead), and keep making  subtle comments about how we shouldn’t be hungry or we should go on a walk or don’t need a snack or that we won’t be eating out at all while we’re here because everything in a restaurant is “bad food”, it’s absolutely maddening.

I’m really struggling with all of it and frankly want to leave, but they have always been so kind and welcoming and we’ve always loved them so nobody wants to step on their toes but I just feel like crap about myself and am struggling to maintain my healthy view of food/meals/my body. My partner is also pretty effected by it but he doesn’t have the same history so he’s been just ignoring it. How do I make it through the next 5 days without a full relapse into behaviors it took me years to overcome? I feel hopeless… and hungry 🥲"

Neutral,"Advice for accepting unexpected changes?  Hello!

I'm new to this group and hoping I can get advice or ideas. Before I jump into where I'm getting stuck, I'd like to mention that I do currently have a therapist and I've also got a dietician for support in nutrition, so no advice needed there.

About 6 months ago, I suddenly gained weight. I've been mostly the same size for years, so this was very uncharacteristic and startling. The scale says 15 lbs, clothes say 2 sizes.

I'm struggling in 2 areas:
1. My body looks and feels different now, and because there's no measurable reason why, I'm having a hard time mentally catching up with it. I had an imperfect body before, I have an imperfect one now. But it's very odd to look in the mirror and see a body that isn't familiar anymore. Not knowing what caused the change is also disturbing to me (is something wrong?), hence the dietician appt.
2. I feel like a hypocrite. I've always been a big proponent of body positivity/acceptance, intuitive eating, health at every size, etc. I don't hate my body, but my struggles to accept it are making me feel like my beliefs only went skin-deep. I know that's not true (I don't look at anyone else's body and feel the same criticism that comes up when I look at mine), but has anyone else felt that? 

This is all messing with my head quite a bit.

Anyway, if anyone has been here and has tips for what helped them settle in and accept their body suddenly and unexpectedly changing, I would love to hear it!"

Neutral,"How to help with body image issues  My little sister, who's only 9 years old, is having issues with her body image. She's told me and others in the family several times that how she looks makes her feel sad. I'm looking for advice on how to help her with that and I hope this is the right place for asking, couldnt post in the body image subreddit because I'm not active in it. 

In our family we're always a little bit 'chubby' as children and the girls usually grow faster than other girls their age, so I understand that she looks 'bigger' in general compared to her friends but it's litterally just how she grows. She's healthy, very active (does dancing, biathlon, skates, exercises at home as well) and she is a very pretty girl. I just worry that it could become an unhealthy obsession, especially in a few years when she becomes a teenager. She's also got a cousin who died of anorexia, idk if there's an increased risk because of genetics or not but just fyi if it's relevant.

So basically I'm wondering how I could help. I understand that the issue is probably with media representation and societal expectations on girls bodies more than how she actually looks and as a guy, who hasn't had the same kind of issues, I feel that I'm not really equipped to help and could use some advice if anyone's willing to share."

Disordered,"Trying… anyone feel the same way?  (TRIGGER WARNING — I used to have an eating disorder years ago and still struggle w body image) 
Not looking for anyone to judge me here. This place should be free of any criticism.

I really try not to beat myself up over this, but every time I have certain events in my life that make it hard for me to exercise daily, I notice the change in my body within a week, and it really discourages me. Recently ive been working seasonal in retail and as you know the holidays are super busy. I even got sick a few days ago and had to stay home. This resulted in barely moving around for 3 days. 
I realize that when im not active im more tired and i get in this habit of not exercising, which sucks because I genuinely enjoy my work outs, and the feeling I get knowing im closer to my goal (which is honestly staying healthy enough to go hiking and do full push ups)

Neutral,"Years to finally accept my body as it is  Long time lurker, first time poster. As AMAB, I have had a life long condition that has put my hormones at odds and for years has caused much distress and even bullying well into adulthood. I have what is known as Gynecomastia, where my testosterone and estrogen are out of balance and both fight for dominance.  This has caused my body to become feminine in some places and male in others, most notable in the chest where I have developed prominent breasts requiring support. While I am not alone in my condition,  it's not as common as the more common ""man boobs"" of overweight men and is easily mistaken as just a trip to the gym will fix it.

It has taken me years to accept my body for what it is while maintaining my masculine birth. While it's still a struggle at times dealing with a trait that society deems ""for women only"", these days I am at peace with my body and am learning to enjoy life as I should be. It is possible. Thank you."
Neutral,"50 “something” years old and exhausted by my brain  At 40 yo I had made a pact with myself that I would no longer care what others thought. It actually got worse. 

Now as I am in my 50’s you’d think I’d really be able to embrace this concept. But no, it’s even worse yet! So bad that I barely leave my house.

I feel like it’s never going to happen for me. I have been to therapy over the years but I guess I haven’t heard the right “words” yet that make acceptance click.

What “words” or “sayings” helped make it click for you? For example, in 12 step programs they have many sayings like “one day at a time”and “keep it simple”. Or if it wasn’t a saying, maybe a certain set of actions that helped you? A book or even a really good therapist on the east coast? 

TIA!"

Neutral,"What are some microagressions you have faced as a overweight person?  I can’t believe there is a sub on Reddit where people are openly fatphobic and “dismantle” the concept of fatphobia. Someone said fatphobia isn’t like homophobia because queer people are born queer and fat people aren’t born fat but if you use that logic then people who were disabled after birth can’t say they face ableism. There are a variety of factors that can contribute to someone being overweight, like mental health, poverty, health reasons and many more things that happen after birth. It’s Honestly heartbreaking to see how some people think. 
Anyways I have a hard time deciphering what someone’s intentions are when they say or do something backhanded because I’m not only overweight but I’m also a black woman. 

One example of a fatphobic microaggression I can think of is when I was 13 around the holidays my older cousin cooked a feast for thanksgiving. I ate a few bites of macaroni and got full. When she heard that I was no longer hungry she got angry. I guess she expected me to eat more than I did because I was the biggest. She cracked a few jokes about my eating to everyone then wanted me to continue eating despite the fact I was full."

Disordered,"Did anyone else have a mom that taught them to hate their body?   

When I was eleven and I discovered that I had stretch marks on my thighs, the first thing my mom told me was that stretch marks happen when you gain weight too quickly. That I should try my hardest not to get any more. They were permanent and I could never get rid of them, like a tattoo. And my mom hated tattoos.

When I used to go shopping with my mom for clothes, she’d manipulate me into buying clothes that were too small for my body. She’d try to use them as a motivator to get me to lose weight. I never lost the weight to fit into them, and instead, from the ages of nine to fifteen, I wore clothes to school that were too tight and very uncomfortable.

My mom has physically ripped food out of my hands before.

She used to pat my stomach when we were out in public.

If we went to a restaurant and I ordered something with a lot of pasta or bread, my mom would make sure to tell the waiter “you can tell she’s the one who likes carbs in the family”

And it wasn’t as though I was a fat kid growing up. I was a normal little kid with a normal amount of body fat and a normal child-size tummy. But because of the way my mom talked to me about my body, I believed her and spent some of the earliest years of my life negatively obsessing over my self-image.

I don’t think any other seven-year-old in my second-grade class was worried about how fat they looked.

When I was in fifth grade and I needed a training bra, my mom told me that it was because I was eating unhealthily. I felt so ashamed to have breasts. 

When I was twelve and I decided that I no longer wanted to play field hockey, I was so scared that my mom would think less of me because I wasn’t doing something athletic. I thought that she’d see me as even fatter and grosser than she had before.

In eighth grade when everyone was hitting puberty and growing up, my mom would point out how all the other girls my age were thinning out and I wasn’t. It made me feel horrible. I felt like I was doing something wrong.

I ate the same foods as everyone else, but to my mom, my body was never good enough. 

And now even though she’s cooled down somewhat, I still struggle.

I struggle with my self-image. I struggle with eating in front of people. Clothes shopping is so dysphoric and almost always ends in me crying. If my mom is in the kitchen and I’m hungry, I wait for her to leave. If I’m out to dinner with her, ordering what I want always results in a myriad of poking and prodding; “ooh, that looks good, my body can’t handle all that grease and fat.” “Are you really going to eat all of that?” 

One time my friend was over at the house, and we were eating cookies. I asked my mom if I could have another, and she immediately took the cookie box out of my hands and told me how crazy I was for wanting another one because of their calorie count. My friend told me he felt sorry for me that my mom was willing to do that and embarrass me in front of my friend. It wasn’t until then that I fully realized that my mom is the one with the problem, not me. 

Since having that realization a few months ago, I've started appreciating myself more. I've never felt more myself than I do right now. I can look at myself and be proud of who I am. I don't tear myself apart every time I look in the mirror. I don't force myself to skip meals. I don't discount myself. I am amazing on my own. My body is absolutely a fucking temple and it's beautiful and incredible and so fucking powerful. My body is going to do what it wants. It's okay for me to have stretch marks. It's okay for me to have breasts. All of that shit is normal. My mom has her own problems and I can choose not to listen. I'm pushing through."

Neutral,"Is my appearance so important?  Yesterday one of my friends and my mam commented a picture of me and told me things like I look ''like a man'' and my smile is weird. I didn't even ask them to look at the picture. They probably just wanted to tease me but it hurt and made me quite sad because I thought that this picture of me is not too bad. I deleted the picture afterwards. I am not conventionally beautiful, but I have been trying to accept what I look like and I don't actually think I am so hideous, but now I am wondering if the perception I have of myself is wrong and all people can see is this ugly creature that I apparently am.

Is my appearance really so important? I want people to like me because of my personality and not because I look a certain way. I hate it when I am reduced to my appearance because I think I am so much more than that. But I am wondering if my way of thinking is just naive and I will always be seen as ugly no matter what I do."

Neutral,"Let me be fuzzy  While desperately looking for that chic ethnic FIT I can slay in for Diwali, I came across this awesome sleeveless Kurti which was perfect...but it was sleeveless that means SHAVING! 
God, why! But wait why do we HAVE to shave if we hate it so much. Let's be honest making ourselves go through hot wax and exorcist level yanking or bleeding to death while shaving is like self-torture just to look good (in the eyes of society). If it is that painful why do we make ourselves go through it? 

Did you see the movie Khiladi? The one where Akshay Kumar was seen flaunting his body hair. Wouldn't it be amazing if we saw women flaunting theirs too? 

Have you seen animals shave their body hair? There's a reason why we have body hair. It keeps mammals warm. It protects the body against trauma and also against ultraviolet damage. In human beings, specialized hairs such as eyelashes and hairs inside the nostrils and external ears afford some protection from the environment. Eyebrows prevent sweat from getting into the eyes. Scalp hairs may assist in stabilizing the temperature of the brain. Hairs can also excrete toxic substances like arsenic, and are thus of use in forensic medicines. As every dermatologist knows, the physiological functions of hairs are immeasurable.

We all go through puberty. Hairy or otherwise it's one's choice to either keep the hair on our body or not. Society or your friends can't shame you for your body hair. There is a reason why we were born with the same. It protects us from so many unimaginable things. Imagine not having eyelashes or nostril hair, then how will you survive the dust that affects your body? All I want to say is let's continue to break the barriers and show that beauty is diverse and you don't have to be a certain stereotype to be beautiful. 

When you look at the world, the world isn't just one palette. It's a rainbow. So, say goodbye to your inner critic and take a pledge to be kinder to yourself and others too.

Neutral,"Why am I so fatphobic?  All I care about is having an ideal body in order to be wanted - I associate my self-worth with how much others « want » me or desire (to have sex with) my body. Therefore I feel the need to be exceptional in the way I look, so that I could be « wanted » regardless of the context and life situation. It’s the apocalypse? Well at least I’m hot. This fucked up reasoning made me realize that I am disconnected with reality. I don’t even want an ideal body, I want « beyond ideal », something never achieved before, and something I may never reach before I die. Therefore I may die unhappy and let my life pass right by me. This is terrifying. Any advice?"

Someone made a comment to friend of mine (who is beautiful inside and out!) about one of her teeth and from that point onward she wouldn’t smile showing her teeth. 

A personal example is that when I was about 13 I was shopping with a friend and tried on this gorgeous yellow dress and when I came out of the dressing room, my friend looked at me and said “wow yellow really doesn’t suit you.” Yellow had always been my favourite colour and it took me years to feel comfortable wearing yellow again.

Neutral,A new member  Hi everyone. I'm new to the subreddit and the community in general. I'm a large guy with a small penis so I never had much confidence with women. I recently had sex for the first time with someone who made me feel special and seen. It made me realize how badly I've been treating myself for how I looked and how my body is. I realized I need to work toward healing the relationship with myself. I also want to surround myself with more understanding and accepting people like her. I'm scared and excited about where this journey will take me and I have hope I will end up in a better place. I'm looking forward to reading about and interacting with everyone.

Disordered,"I did one of those ""posed vs unposed"" photoshoots of myself and it really made me feel better about myself.  I was experiencing a lot of body shame and guilt about eating today. I was getting ready for bed and happened to look in the mirror half undressed and was comparing my body posed vs candid, criticising my candid body and wishing it looked how it did when I suck in and work my angles. I don't know why, but I decided to take photos of both, by setting up a self timer. 

I know a lot of people don't find these kind of images helpful or empowering, and maybe not when it's someone else. But weirdly, putting the two images side by side felt really affirming. For some reason right now I feel more self connection and compassion. 

Just wanted to share!"

I've suffered with self esteem issues my whole life, I'm chubby, I have loads of stretch marks from weight loss and I'm suspected to have PCOS which, if I do, causes me to have dark hair on my arms and face which I have been shaving and hiding for years but seeing a subreddit like this is really uplifting.

Disordered,"Mis and fat disclaimers on dating apps  I've (25F) been talking to a girl I met on the apps for a while now. She's postponed our first date twice and is very active and fit. I usually don't make disclaimers about my body, I just let the full body photos on my app speak for themselves. Today she made a comment about being chubby after eating xyz, and she's made diet talk and body comments about herself before, so I asked to make sure she knew what my body looks like. She said she didn't mean it offensively but ultimately was offended for not feeling she can say anything without being judged (earlier I had asked for clarification on how she felt after she replied just ""ok"" to another topic where I thought I offended her with my boundaries, I thought she was upset/being short). It's so hard to discern tone from texts and it's mercury retrograde, so I'm hoping someone here can understand where I'm coming from. I shouldn't have let my past experiences and insecurity effect me but I did.

Edit: this was supposed to be titled ""miscommunication and..""

Edit 2: Thanks everyone who responded and validated my gut feeling. I agree that she didn't respond well, and overall is not what I'm looking for in a partner. Even if she didn't mean anything by her comments she should have been able to apologize, communicate respectfully, and not put all the blame on me. I didn't totally see that before because I'm so quick to accept fault in situations, but I do now and I'm glad I made this post."

About a month ago I started my body acceptance journey and the way I relate to food and my body image. for the past month it has been going REALLY well. i've been able to find some really helpful tools that relax my mind and are helping me accept who i am. i'm not trying to lose weight, i'm trying to accept my body the way it is in the now and i was doing so well...

this past week has been a hard one and i'm fighting the urge to fall back on old harmful ways such as negative talk geared towards my self-image. what do you all do to help fight that negative talk? i have some methods that i'm more than happy to share but i wanna hear about journeys similar to mine. i've been dieting and hating my body since i was a child and i'm done"

Neutral,"Rant: Just got asked ""why is body image and weight so important to you?  I am heated and need to vent. I posted on an emotional support discord server asking to talk to someone about weight and body image. I specifically said that I wanted someone to listen to me. I am having anxiety at work, and the emotional support hotline I call isn't picking up.  When a poster offered to help me out over DM, he then asked me ""why is this so important to you"" within 5 min of talking. I shared a bit about what I was struggling with, and he asked that question. I told him that his question isn't helpful. I ended the convo, bc I didn't think we were a good match. 

Does anyone not like having to explain why body image is an important issue? To me, there's so much information out there on why it is important. In fact, I think it's common sense that many women struggle with body image concerns. I don't want to be in a position where I have to educate someone on something that is naturally important to a lot of women (and some men). 

I complained to one of the mods on an emotional support server. The posters on there pride on being empathetic. Everyone has the right to feel upset over they are struggling without having to explain ""why."" Sometimes, there isn't a clear reason.  

For those who say ""maybe he was trying to help or get you to think, l have analyzed the issue on my own of why body image is important to me millions of times over the years. What I was looking for empathy...not being prodded on how my issues came about. 

Not to mention that my body image issues stem from trauma. Why do I want to rehash complex trauma to a stranger who I just met for five minutes?

Rant over. Can anyone relate?"

So, I want to ask if there’s anyone here who was a skinny child but gained weight during puberty? (I really hope this ain’t against the guidelines—I just want to feel “normal” in a sense)."

Neutral,"Expectation to wear ""tight/fitted"" clothes  Some cultures/societies expect people to wear tight or fitted clothing, especially women but also men in the 2010s with the rise of ""slim fit"" and tighter pants.

She says that she thinks the waist trainer will make her feel better because she thinks the feeling of her waist being squeezed makes her feel more comfortable. I think that there is too much correlation between the two subjects and that she is getting one not for the ""feel"" but rather the look.

Neutral,"I feel one reason it's hard to accept yourself is because we never stay the same  Not that you change all of the sudden over night but we do over time. If our bodies are constantly changing how can we really know who we are or what we look like?  I feel we all subconsciously know we're going to get old to  so we fear aging.

I think that's why we get so obsessed about our looks because we don't know how long it will stay and want to do everything we can to preserve it. Youth is one of the most prized possessions in society and the thought of losing it leaves people feeling uneasy. Anyways I have no clue if this is true or if there's any validity to it, it's just my viewpoint outside of other reasons people have trouble accepting themselves."

There was lots of people ""preaching"" her saying ""you are so brave!!"" and ""I have the same body type and I hate it but you look cute"". Why those comments? Cause that girl didnt had an Instagram model body type.

If you look comments on a post from a normative girl you will only see compliments about how hot she looks, yet if we have an /average/ body we are supposed to be ""brave"" to show it? Like the normal thing were to be ashamed of it?

Maybe I'm reaching but I found it the opposite to normalizing it when people say these things like you are beautiful *despite* your body type and if you show it you are *brave* like it should be hidden or what?

I don't want to be brave, a body positive activist nor even be hot; I just want to chill on the beach. Stop minding someone else body."

I don't think it's something people talk about or want others to know but they're fighting the battle inside mentally. Now I don't know if everyone does and it's probably subjective by individual but it's more than I think probably. I feel this should be a topic society should be more open about.  A lot of people with self-esteem issues who probably feel trapped because they can't talk about it.

Neutral,"Advise - how to promote body positivity in teenage girls  My sister is 15 years younger than me, we grew up in vastly different worlds. When I was in secondary school smartphones were brand new so only the very rich children had them and Instagram wasn’t even heard of! I am very aware of how easy it must be for teenage girls to become enthralled by very heavily edited images of long legged, little headed reanimated Bratz dolls but I really don’t want it to fuck her up! She is a very intelligent and well mannered young lady and in no way overweight, she is however taller and sturdier than a lot of her friends. She is adamant she’s a size UK 8 but she has to squeeze into them and would be much more comfortable in a size 12. She gets very upset at this and refuses to wear anything over a size 10 but is visibly uncomfortable. She is now unwilling to shop in a few different high street shops saying their sizing is wrong (I know this can be the case but in this instance it’s a coping machine). How do I make her realise there is nothing wrong with being a size 12 and she’s gorgeous regardless of what the label in her jeans says? It’s such a sensitive subject and I don’t want to do more harm than good. Thanks In advance"

In today’s society, people are expected to conform to beauty standards more than ever. Adolescent girls are an especially targeted and vulnerable population as companies aim to profit off of their insecurities by selling products that claim to “fix” what society deems as “flaws.” The pressure to fit in can exacerbate body image problems many girls have, and can lead them to engaging in unhealthy behaviors in order achieve an unattainable body ideal. Due to this, we have developed the Family Body Project (FBP), which is an experimental body acceptance and eating disorder prevention program in Oregon delivered virtually in English and Spanish for female-identified adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 years-old and their caregivers. If you are considering participating, you will receive an initial 15-minute phone call to screen for eligibility. If you are eligible, we will proceed to scheduling an hour-long assessment that further examines body image concern. As this is an intervention study, eligible families will either be assigned to the control group or the intervention group. Participating families will be compensated for their time with gift cards, totaling $95 over the course of the study. Teen families living anywhere in Oregon are able to participate, so please share this if you believe you know a family, or families, to whom this may be of interest!

Potential participants can email Deanna Linville at linville@uoregon.edu, or leave a confidential voicemail at her office number: 541-346-0921. Potential Spanish-speaking participants should contact Celeste at cmenamor@uoregon.edu."

Neutral,"First step to acceptance  F (24). Never thought I’d have the confidence to be admitting this publicly but over the last 2 years I’ve developed severe body confidence issues as a result of my breasts shrinking dramatically.

It started with just a slightly looser bra but it’s at the point now where I’m about the same size I was at 14 and stuffing my bra with socks and tissue to disguise what I’ve lost. I’ve even grown a full on 70’s bush just so I don’t look like a child when I see myself naked.

But after nearly 2 years of constant anxiety that someone might find out and feeling like I’m somehow worth less without my big boobs yesterday our postman saw me without my stuffed bra on (I wasn’t topless I just forgot to put the bra on under my tshirt before I answered the door!) and didn’t seem shocked and disgusted, nor did I feel embarassed. 

It’s a long way from accepting my new small breasts I know and it’s different to a close friend finding out etc but I think it’s a good first step :)"

Neutral,"How do I remain body positive when my boyfriend suggests I dress in clothes for a different body type?  We're both in our 20s. Will not break up, he is very sweet and none of this is done maliciously!

He always says I'm so cute that I should dress up more (which I want to!), but the things he always suggest just don't look flattering on me. I work out and am somewhat health conscious, but I know his type is very much petite in all areas while I'm very short waisted with a strawberry/apple shaped body (broad shoulders/ribcage, no hourglass). 

I've come SUCH a long way in loving my body over our 6 years together, but now that we've both become more confident, the things he's suggested I wear (when I ask and when I don't) just won't look good on me because I don't have the body that would look best with them.

The main things he suggests are low waisted bottoms (pants/skirts/shorts) and spaghetti strap tops, both of which look so awkward on me! Low waisted bottoms are already not great on their own imo, but with my short and wide waist it looks odd. My shoulders and chest being broad with thicker upper arms means thin strap tops just exaggerate how short and wide I am! 

Normally I could just brush it off, **it's not like he pushes them on me**, but I can't get it out of my head that I'm not his type. I know he loves me and thinks I'm pretty, but it's ever present in my mind that I'll never look the way he'd secretly want me to because, uhh, bones?"

Neutral,"I am worried my teenage cousin is developing body image issues because of the community she lives in. What can I do to help her?  Content warning: brief mention of disordered eating. 

She is 13. I’m 22F. 

Last I heard (my cousin was 12 at this point) her mom was trying  get her to eat less and work out to lose belly fat.

Now I hear she’s skipping a lot of meals. When I spoke to her about it she almost seemed to see it as a point of pride/an achievement that she doesn’t eat much.

I’m worried it’s going to affect her metabolism and overall health. I am also concerned that it’s going to/already has done a lot of damage to her self worth and mental health.

How can I help her build a healthy relationship with her body? 



To give some context:

In the country we come from immediate family, relatives, friends, teachers, neighbours and even strangers on the road will not hesitate to comment on your appearance. Especially weight. It can be brutal on your confidence. 

I went through it and now it breaks my heart to see she is going through it too.

To give you an example:

 I spoke to a relative I hadn’t heard from in years and the first thing she said to me was something to the effect of:

“So all you STILL do is eat huh?” 

Apparently she saw a photo somewhere.

With western media becoming more prominent in our country, the fatphobic beauty standard has only become more rampant in recent years. 

However, the body positive movement has not had the same level of influence. 

I don’t wanna be another person in her life telling her what to do with her body.But I have been where she is.So I at least want to her to know I’m there for her. And hopefully help her foster a healthy relationship with her body and self worth despite her environment making it hard.

But how do I go about that? 

Small but important detail; we live in different countries so our main form of communication is calls,texts and video chats.

Neutral,"I get so sad when people (generally girls) talk about others and describe them as “my dream body”  ##TRIGGER WARNING: talking about wanting to change your body and other similar mentalities

I was searching reviews of ASOS because I’m interested to find some pretty sundresses from an European shop (no success so far) and I stumbled upon a video showing ASOS clothes irl. There was a girl trying clothes on and the comment section was filled with “she has my dream proportions”, “you have a perfect figure I want your body”, “ugh I wish I was born with her body” and that triggered and saddened me. 

I wish people would 1.realize you can’t make your body look a certain way because we all have different body types and structures and 2.it’s better to accept yourself than strive to be a certain body type especially when in most cases it’s unattainable 

I know I used to think this way too and looking back I realize that even if I had achieved my “dream” body I still wouldn’t have felt like it’s enough.

Idk this is more of a rant cause the comments triggered me. I apologize if this isn’t fit for the subreddit"

Neutral,"My morbid curiosity is derailing my body acceptance/neutrality journey.  Please forgive my formatting, as I’m on mobile. 

I’ve noticed a pattern in most general population type subreddits, such as WCGW or even ones like MadeMeSmile, that if the post includes a picture or video of a woman who is anything even slightly larger than a US size 4 somewhere near the top will be highly upvoted comments of people making fun of how “fat” she is. I, for some reason, cannot seem to stop myself from falling down the rabbit hole reading these comments. This compulsion exists for me everywhere I see it, it just seems to happen the most on Reddit. I am almost always bigger than the women in these pictures/videos typically are, and it’s having a really negative effect on my mental health as I work towards body acceptance/neutrality. I started working out and eating healthier a little while ago with the goal of general wellness rather than a set goal weight, but this has me backsliding into a more toxic diet culture fueled mindset.

I just wanted to rant. I’m thinking the healthiest thing for me would be to not read the comments or just avoid SM as much as possible."

I kept comparing myself to my friends, as well to how I ""think"" I should look and I immediately stared to panic about the wedding day. We're having a very small thing, just city hall, parents, and a friend to take some photos, and I can't overcome feeling that all the photos will look horrible. Im so scared that I won't be able to handle the day or even look back on it with happy feelings... Hell honestly I'm just scared that how I see myself my partner will see me that way as well too, and be disgusted marrying/ being married to me. I feel so stupid venting like this but I just didn't want to sit with these feelings alone right now. I don't know what I am needing or expecting from posting this.

I guess, its pretty normal to feel this way and want to look the perfect way for a special or even general day. Being overwhelmed is normal. I just needed to say what was happing in my head. Sorry for being super extra, and to those who read thank you for letting me vent."
Neutral,"How to help a fatphobic partner on their journey  Hi everyone,  
I searched in the group but did not find another post that could help me, so if you know where go find it please direct me the right way! 
Some time ago my boyfriend raised the issue tht he thinks I am a bit too fat, I am an overweight woman, who has fought hard to accept her body, but still struggles with body image. 
When he spoke about how he thinks: 
I eat too much 
I am not healthy enough 
I have such a pretty face 
I am a  eight but if I was thin I would be beyond a ten. 

I don't need to tell you we almost broke up, I simply cannot afford to be with someone who thinks my insecurities are justified by how I look and that I should change cause I am not ok like I am. 
In addition, I think the thing that hurts me the most is that he kept on going back to the concept of ""health"" insisting on how his opinion was backed up by health concerns. 
To give you an example of how this is a little hypocritical: I am a smoker and he never insisted with the same strength on me quitting, because we love in a society where we would rather see someone  chain smoking than  healthy fat person. 

Anyway,  we talked for a long time, he seemed to understand my point of view, but I am afraid mostly because he just did not like seeing me hurt, I would like to be able to give him some source of information,  a book articles podcasts or anything really where he could hear it not only from me, where with more back up and scientific knowledge  someone could explain  to him my point of view. 

I also now struggle from time to time with more body image issuea than before, have the tendency to feel like I should loose weight  or exercise ""for him"". This of course creates a vicious circle where I almost abstain from those activities cause I associate them too much with negative thoughts  about my body and the idea of easing him instead of the healthy drive to go for  a run just because I want to feel my body alive and moving in all its functional and healthy rolls!

Neutral,"Learning to accept crooked teeth  I have what some call a ‘snaggletooth’ - it’s essentially a misaligned tooth. I believe it’s usually a top canine tooth that kind of protrudes out. Mine is pretty obvious and due to the lack of space in my mouth, I can’t really fully close my mouth. 

I’ve been teased since childhood and it’s made me extremely self conscious. Most people around me that have received dental and orthodontic work view it as a standard and accessible treatment and not a privilege. There is a lot of humor associated with bad teeth on tv or movies. I just want to disappear when something like that comes on screen when I’m with friends. 

I hate taking pictures - I’d rather be behind the camera. I contain my laughter and cover my mouth. I have lost ways to freely express joy and happiness. 

Does anyone have advice to work towards a confident smile knowing that dental and orthodontic work is out of reach for the moment? Or maybe ways to feel neutral about it and less embarrassed. TIA"

Neutral,"Looking for Advice on Body Acceptance After Medical Treatment and Sudden Change in Body Image  Please let me know if this post goes against any rules - it's my first time posting here so I hope I understood the rules correctly: weight and body ACCEPTANCE advice :)

\[Warnings: Body Image, Weight Acceptance, Illness\]

So I suffer from a health condition which caused me to not absorb nutrients and calories and recently I got on a medicine which allows me to gain weight for the first time in a decade. And I am so happy, I feel more energetic and lively and my bloodwork has come back as healthy for the first time since my disease started.

The only issue is I'm kind of now battling with loving my new body (I love how I feel and the idea of gaining weight - it was always a fantasy to be healthy and to be able to make progress in certain activities I love like weightlifting) but I suppose I'm a bit insecure about a few things - mostly about how rapidly my body is changing now. For one because the medicine made me gain weight really quickly I developed a ton of stretchmarks which I never had before since I never really gained any weight even during puberty. I love stretchmarks on other people I think they're so beautiful but for some reason me getting them it's caused some body dysmorphia I suppose (mostly of how rapidly and how many I have gotten). I also am dealing with what the new me looks like. My family are very heavy in general (genetics) and I know I genetically have the chance of my normal weight being much higher than it was due to my disease. So I really want to learn how to accept that possibility if it happens.

I've partially accepted that and am even looking forward to being able to use my increased weight to create muscle once everything settles.

I guess if anyone has advice on loving a body that's changing rapidly I'd really appreciate it!

(I'm not looking to be changed, just want to accept my new body and be happy my disease is now in remission).

Didn't see a rule but might as well just add this in case: Male, he/him, 25, US."
Neutral,"Dating with Body dysmorphia  
As the title and subreddit suggest, I have body dysmorphia. Actually, I haven’t been properly diagnoses, but my body and I do not have a good relationship. I don’t think the scale is my friend, but I can’t stop stepping on it. Anyways, I’m looking into getting a therapist because I used to have a neutral relationship with the way I look and I miss that. Here’s the thing, I recognize my anxieties about my body are probably all in my head, but I personally feel overweight. Like very overweight. I want to get back into dating, but my body anxieties keep coming to me. What if my partner sees my body the way I do? What if I’m just as grotesque to others as I am to myself? I’m wondering— how can I, or should I even, date with these inner demons? Besides my looks, I have confidence in myself (I love my personality and I am a very capable woman), but my body insecurities are far bigger right now than any confidence. I constantly catch myself thinking about different surgeries or things I want to change. Maybe I’m not ready to enter the dating game again with these thoughts. That’s okay, but how can I start to love myself again? :("

Neutral,"Feeling insecure about my clubbed fingers. Need advice  Hi.
So, I never actually put this type of insecurity in a ""spotlight"" but I have clubbed fingers on my hands and toes ever since I was born (usually it's associated with a disease but mine are just genetic. My fingers are somewhere in between Jeremy Renner and Mickey Rourke  type fingers).
The thing is- it never really ""bothered"" me in my life so much compared to other debilitating conditions but I do get kinda insecure sometimes about it and now is one of those times.

It's hard because I'm almost ""anticipating"" a time where it will become some sort of a ""problem"" and I'm struggling with juist accepting this. They don't look too bad but still. I look at them and I see a deformity.

Any advice on how to own this or not become so insecure about it will be great. I never really discussed this issue with anyone so I thought about turning to reddit.

All of these standards society has made up are just there to sell more products to people with low self esteem.

Do you want to live in a world where we all look alike? Men being these 6ft tall muscular, bearded beasts. And all women being these skinny and curvy goddesses?

Just because you don't look like the ""perfect person"" doesn't mean you need to change anything about your looks.

The ""perfect person"" doesn't exist. 
We are all equal, we are all the same.
We are just skin, muscle and fat.

It doesn't matter how you look. It matters how you act, how you are as a person.

I really frequently see women on here complaining about their breasts for example.
They often complain that their small or saggy or whatever, and? Who cares how your breasts look? Why see yourself like that? Yes you might not be happy with them, but im certain that people like **you** because of **you** and not because of your appearance.

Same goes for people on here who often say that they don't like their body hair. Body hair is natural. if you want to grow it out, grow it out.
If you want to shave it, shave it. You look beautiful whatever you do. Beauty doesn't come from the appearance, it comes from the heart.

And the posts I see the most is people talking about their weight. No matter if you are plus sized or skinny, does that make you less of a human just because of your body size? 
If you feel good in your body overall and don't have any complains (like hurting joints or whatever) you should focus on other things, more important things.

Acceptence, acceptence is something really important. Not only towards other people, but also towards yourself. It is difficult, I know I've been there. Just remember that whatever you look like, isn't that important. Yes, there are a few people who might judge you, and I guarntee that those people struggle with their own body image or some other issue.

Your body doesn't show your worth.

You people are amongst the nicest people I've seen on the internet, bringing other peoples confidence up. We are human, we should build each other up so they can build us up.

Neutral,"How to be confident in my very hairy legs  Basically I used to shave my legs regularly, but during quarantine last year, I decided to stop shaving in general because I realized I was doing it more out of obligation than doing it because I actually wanted to, so I let my leg hair grow out. I’m a hairy person in general so I grew a lot of leg hair, think super hairy guy leg lol. When it comes to my personal opinion, I appreciate my leg hair because I like to be natural, it makes me me, and affirms my gender identity (demigirl). But obviously I know not much people see it the way I do and it makes me feel like it’s me against the world. 

It’s summer now and whenever I go out, I never see any other girls with as much leg hair as me. Most have smooth, shiny, hair-free legs. I would love to wear shorts, skirts, and pretty dresses, but I know I stand out, and I can’t stand people looking at me like a freak. It makes me so angry that I can see guys with both hairy legs and shaven legs, but for girls, we don’t have that option without being seen as freaks. It’s so frustrating. 

Does anyone have any tips for being a bit more confident in their leg hair? Or can anyone relate to this?

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind comments and advice, I feel much more encouraged to be confident in my legs, even if just a little bit. This is kinda cheesy but I will hold them dear to my heart since it’s so hard to find this kind of support! And I hope it will give others the same boost in confidence in their body hair :)"

I don't regret working out but I regret taking it too seriously and spending so much time in the gym. I still workout but my goal is to not get bigger. I feel I let the insecurity of not being man enough get to me. A man's strength isn't based on how big his muscles are. In the end you're still you big or small.

Neutral,"Carrying the Weights  “Too fat, too skinny, too short, too tall, too anything. There’s a sense that we’re all ‘too’ something, and we are all not enough. This is life. Our bodies change. Our minds change. Our hearts change.”

\-Emma Stone

Ours is a society that elevates thinner bodies over heavier ones. Even thinner bodies have particular measurements that must fit societal standards, let alone heavier bodies. As a young girl, I have always noticed some anticipations created around female bodies; looks-wise, shape-wise, size-wise, color-wise, height-wise. Growing up in such a society with an established dimension for a female body has been very challenging. I had to continuously look down upon myself for not fitting to that standard. I accepted the societal norms as it was. My entire childhood was me being used for every other joke my friends could make, like, ""You're too small, I need a magnifying glass to see you."" I still remember my neighborhood aunty telling my mother that she would have looked nicer if she was a bit taller.

The shame women and girls experience at some point in their lives can have enduring and conceivably crippling impacts on their self-esteem. The statements below are some of the victims of body shaming, and I am sure you will see a little bit of yourself in each of the accounts.

""I was for a very long time stick-thin regardless of what I ate. All considered me puny until I started actively participating in sports. Breasts were the last thing that grew on me, and I, along with others, have had quite a laugh about it. Unlike me, my sister was fairer, stronger, curvier, and hourglass-shaped. For a long time, the comparison that came along held me back from trying to accept myself,"" says Supriya, a 21-year-old student.

""I still remember the day I had gone to one of my relative's houses. I had worn short pants, and my hairy legs were shamelessly showing. One of my relatives said that my legs did not look like a girl's legs. I felt so ashamed of myself. I could never accept my hairy legs and would always shave or wax them. Much later, I met a woman in Pondicherry who was not ashamed of showing her body hair in public. She could confidently wear shorts without waxing or shaving. That's when I realized if she can accept it, why can't I?"" Says a teacher named Samikhya.

Body positivity does not come easy. You have to remind yourself every day that you are a work of art and you are supposed to be different, from the way you look to the way you are. There's nothing called the perfect body. Ever visited a garden? Do you call the Dahlia ugly because it doesn't look like a rose? Then why do the same with women or even with yourself?"

And I read about a woman who goes to her DR and refuses to get on the scale. I’m considering doing this at my appt on Tuesday because I’ve gained A LOT of weight and I don’t want that number in my head or for that to be all my dr focuses on. 

Before I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, I was always thin. But the pain is just too overwhelming for me now to get out and move the way I used to. I’m fat because I have fibro, it’s not that I have fibro because I’m fat.

You feel me? Anyone else done this at the dr?"

Neutral,"So much progress made in body acceptance but I still feel like negative comments from others upset me so much! Any advice or experiences that have helped others move forward?  Hello! I am someone in a semi-newly fat body. I've been trying to unlearn fat-phobia for a long time and I feel like the days of having negative comments and thoughts about myself are much better than they once were. HOWEVER, I have been struggling a lot with my environment and the people around me. 

For example, comments of others' weights or diets or body image problems really have been getting to me. Because I am objectively larger than so many of them, it hurts my feelings so much when they hate on their own body parts and fatness that are objectively a lot smaller than mine. I also hate hearing the comments of ""I'm going to turn into the garbage I eat"" type comments that people try to make sound funny. 

It often feels like the comments knock me off my track a little. I hate that it does. I would love to be fully unbothered and see it for what it is - their own insecurities and not a negative reflection of me. It isn't as easy as I wanted it to be though! Do any of you have similar experiences and strategies that have helped you move forward?"

Neutral,"I wore a cropped tank top and shorts in public today!  So, I grew up being the “big girl” and during the summer months would wear sweaters and hoodies. I guess the reasoning was no one would be able to look at my body and judge me. I’ve always had a weird relationship with my body because of that but I’ve been working on it. Last summer, I wore shorts out in public which was something my younger self would never do. 

Well today, I was with some of my friends who are quite smaller than me. I trust these people and am very comfortable around them and since it was nearly 95(F), I was wearing the only crop top that I own. We were cooking and realized we were missing some things and needed to head to the store. We loaded into one of the cars and left. 

It wasn’t until we pulled into the parking lot that I realized that I didn’t have anything to cover myself with. Usually I keep a hoodie, jacket or even a oversized flannel in the back of my car for things like this but we didn’t take my car. And with it being so hot out, waiting in the car wasn’t a smart idea. So I decided that I just had to go with it. 

I quickly explained that I was a bit uncomfortable with going in, I was reassured that we will be in and out within 10 minutes and they would fight anyone who even looked in my direction. Like most of the shopping trips we take, 10 minutes turned into an hour and we brought more than we came for. I didn’t even realize it but I was simply enjoying myself with my friends. 

As soon as we left, everyone asked if that was okay and saying sorry for taking so long. It took me a second to think why I wouldn’t be okay. This was a few hours ago now but Im still very proud of myself and glad I have people to support me through my journey of  selfacceptance."

Neutral,"Has anyone here had breast asymmetry correction surgery?  Hello, I am a 24 year old female and have had pretty asymmetrical breasts since puberty- so was born with it. 

I don’t want to get into the dramatics of it but it has definitely caused me a slew of mental health issues regarding my body image and overall self-esteem.

I have worked really hard to move past those issues and can truly say I love my body now. I have a wonderful partner who thinks I’m perfect that I’ve been with the past 6 years. So I’m not looking into this surgery to bring me love or self-esteem. 

But honestly it is a pain in the ass to constantly have to hide them in clothing and find bras that fit. Swimsuits are annoying. 

I am pretty large chested so it’s really not that noticeable with clothing on, but it’s more of a hassle than anything and occupies more of my mental space than I’d like to admit and that I would gladly clear out for deeper more meaningful things and I think surgery would be really gift me that. 

I am located in the Southern California area and found a surgeon who specializes in it, his before and afters are very impressive for my specific issue. 

The surgery quote is expensive like 12-17k so I need time to save. 

But am wondering about anyone else’s experience with this procedure, advice, recommendations, etc. 

Also if you are happy you had it and how it has positively impacted your life.

Neutral,"Why I will never be a size 0  All my life I’ve compared the way my body looked to other the way people looked. I wanted to be skinny, have a thigh gap, have a flat stomach all the time, and fit into the tinniest clothes. However, I will never be a size 0. It’s not because I don’t “want it bad enough” like some people have suggested, but rather it’s because my body isn’t built for that. I don’t have a small frame; my shoulders are build like a football player, and my hip bones are so many inches larger than my waist. I will never fit in a size small because my body just isn’t made for it. But just because I know I will never look like some girls doesn’t stop me from wishing I did. There are so many times when I’m at the gym, or the pool, or even work where I look at a girl who’s petite and wished I looked like her. 

I did some horrible things to my body along the way to where I am now, and I’m not proud of them at all. I’m not going to lie, I still have thoughts to do those horrific things to myself, but accepting that I will never look like someone else, because nobody else is me, had made things just a little bit easier."

Neutral,"A Love Letter to my Thighs 💌 - something I wrote that I hope might help people who are on their own path to body acceptance ❤️  Dear Thighs,   

I’m sorry. From the bottom of my heart. I’m honestly embarrassed and ashamed at how much contempt I’ve had for you my whole life. I want to get into that, and address that, but first I want to apologize.

I’ve learned so much about our relationship this past year. I’ve been able to appreciate you through a whole new lens and I honestly can’t believe the amount of love that has come from this understanding. 

I *always* blamed you. Unfairly, obviously. But you were the scapegoat, the reason for my appearance issues. The reason my confidence was held back and the reason I called myself all sorts of awful things. I had patience and understanding for other parts of my body, but never you. Too big, too much cellulite, too many stretch marks. In my mind there were so many justifiable reasons to not only be angry at you but to be downright mean. And for that I am so, so sorry. 

But now, I see you for what you are. A marvel of the human body. Something that is capable of incredible feats of strength and beautiful expressions of art (sometimes simultaneously!) Already you’ve taken me to the tops of mountains, you’ve powered me through lakes, rivers, and oceans, and you’ve shown me around some of the most beautiful cities in the world.

Tears have been shed on you, broken hearts have been comforted on you, and I don’t even know how many times claws have poked or scratched you and you’ve still remained a warm and cozy bed for a furry friend. You get me through the boring stuff too, the day-to-day slough of it all. Nearly always without so much as a “thank you” or a little show of gratitude. You’ve never let me down.

So from here on out, I promise to cherish you. To always love and appreciate you. To stick up for you and to never take you for granted again. 

I love you and I am so, so proud of you. 


***



Context for this letter:

This sounds a little strange but my thighs have always “ran hot.” As in, they flush at times. Blood rushes to the fronts of my thighs and they will almost pulse with increased blood flow. 

I first noticed it in elementary school and have tried to compare my thighs to my peers all throughout my life at different stages. In similar situations, my friend’s thighs would never really “run hot” like mine do. 

Now, you can write off this part as ~hippy woo woo~ stuff, but I’m a believer the concept of “energy” and “energy healing.” I’m certainly not saying that there is any one right way of going about interpreting or practicing things like that, but I do believe in listening to your body.

So when I decided to stop and listen to my body, what I found was an enormous amount of shame directed at my thighs. I’m talking go get a forklift amount of shame. It honestly caught me off guard a bit. I scratched at the surface of these feelings and found that a lot of it was rooted in society’s conditioning. Nowadays, it’s become slightly easier as “thicc” has become the new black. But growing up - if you were a girl and you weren’t blonde and skinny, you might as well have been invisible. I had so much resentment towards myself for not fitting those requirements. *So much* emphasis was placed solely on appearances. 

My change in self-acceptance came when I reframed my metric of self-worth. It is SO unfair to judge yourself against the airbrushed, enhanced, and edited content that blares in front of us wherever there’s media. It’s fake. From top to bottom, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment. So instead, take pride in your body’s abilities. Love your body for what it’s capable of, not for how it looks compared to literal propaganda that doesn’t exist without extensive amounts of beauty products and photoshop. 

Self-acceptance is a difficult process for nearly everyone struggling to fit in when they don’t measure up to conventional standards. And with this realization I’m not declaring myself “cured” (although my thighs very rarely “run hot” anymore!), I just now have the perspective to make these issues more manageable. I wanted to include this because I want other people to realize that this kind of problem is one that doesn’t just disappear overnight. Yes, I’ve made leaps and bounds of progress, but there are still good days and bad days. 

Also, the last thing I want is for people to think that this piece is rooted in ableism. I can only imagine the struggles that people who are handicapable go through when it comes to their bodies. I myself have a genetic deformity, it’s not on display constantly, but there are certainly unique struggles that come along with something like that. I still believe that there are ways to appreciate your body for what it is and the ways that it carries you through life. Regardless of its limits or diagnoses, you’re here, you’re breathing, you’re experiencing life, you’re beautiful. 

So please, be easy on yourself. You are a marvel of human evolution and you should appreciate yourself for the insanely impressive things that you’re capable of, be it with your mind, body, or soul."
Neutral,"Finding a body neutral/positive doctor and/or exercise experience?  Hey all- I’m in need of a new primary care physician and am also hoping to find an in-person yoga class in my area. My biggest concern for both of these things is finding someone/place that is body positive/neutral (or at least will respect me as a fat person and the fact that I do not want to change my weight) and willing to make accommodations (in the case of yoga).

I know there are multiple websites and lists of fitness instructors as well as doctors who are HAES approved and/or body positive but none of them are within 3 hours of my area. I am wondering if anyone has found any “tells” that a physician or fitness instructor is accepting in this way. Does anyone have a template of an email and/or conversation they’ve had with these professionals to find out? Even just some questions you’ve asked would be very helpful. 

Side note: I know there is lots of great online body neutral/positive yoga instruction but I’m hoping to find an in person class to get corrections on what I’m doing. Yoga brings me a lot of joy, but I’m concerned about injuring myself by doing it incorrectly. ❤️ That said, feel free to drop any plus size/body pos online yoga instructors in the comments if you have them- I’d love to look into them."

Neutral,"is this sexist or am i just overthinking?  women in general have harsher standards than men, and beauty is very minimal. on tiktok mostly, but on social media whenever a female has an hourglass figure that is plus size, which is a pretty figure just like others, they're always praised on. but when it comes to someone else who is plus size and doesn't have that figure, they're made fun of and called cringy.

now getting into the basics, what mostly causes more women to have a pear or hourglass shape, or simply distributing fat to your thighs, butt, and boobs, is estrogen! you can work out, yes, but for people who have it naturally, estrogen levels will make you gain more weight in those areas making you more attractive as a plus size person, according to society.

i have low estrogen levels and have had more testosterone since i was 12, around the middle of puberty. i never grew up with boobs, all my fat was distributed anywhere else, i didn't really have a big butt or bug thighs. i was and still am plus size, but not the attractive one mostly due to my abnormal hormone levels. if i had more estrogen, i would've maybe had a better appearance.

now i accept myself, but why can't society praise women who don't have such high estrogen levels. women are degraded if they have facial hair, if they don't have an hourglass, if they're bigger, etc. but if women have normal estrogen, which is typically normal, they're always praised.

is this sexist tho?"

Neutral,"Bigger people come to me with their body insecurities, I need help.  So background: I'm a average height, lil 14 year old. I'm kinda skinny. I have no muscle on my body, but I also just have no fat to cover the natural muscle. I'm not like *bony* skinny but you know... I can't gain much weight, and I do have lil abs. I have a genetic unevenness in my chest muscles that I normally hide well. Lastly, due to a lil shyness of my own, no one rlly sees me without a shirt on (other than immidiate fam). I am confident in my body tho 


Normally when ppl rlly see my skinniness, they will have one of four responses. 


1.) A compliment

2.) Passive aggressive/backhanded compliment

3.) An insult

4.) a compliment followed by immense self deprication


I don't mind 1, 2, or 3, but 4 is what bothers me. A friend of mine (been friends for a while) recently saw a picture of me that I didn't have a shirt on in. Their response was ""Omg your so fit, I wish I had your body, I'm so fat, I need to lose weight."" 


I don't know what to say to that. As much as I want to help, I don't know how. If I feel comfy, I normally show the unevenness of my pectoral muscles to prove that no bodies are ""perfect,"" but that never helps much. I like helping people, I like giving advice, but idk what to do. 


Someone recently asked for weight loss tips and exercises. I told them I don't gain weight, and never had to really work for the body I do have; I don't know because I never had to know. 


So what I'm asking is, what do I say in these situations? If you were them what would you want to hear? How do I help them? *without sounding condescending*


TLDR; People come to a skinny dude who has never needed to work for weight loss for tips and advice. See questions above. 

I'm rlly bad at explaining things, so hopefully this makes sense. If u have any questions or need clarification, lmk."

So I've come from quite bullying job environments and had to move from the house I grew up in due to a nasty family being moved in next door that would be abusive, both inside the house (such as in the garden and through the walls) and when out. As a result, most of the time I'm quite nervous when I am out, even if I feel I'm looking good, as I'm afraid of the negativity/confrontation I might come across. Alot of people say not to worry as chances are you'll never see the people who are like it out and about again but I can't help but feel a bit of trepidation anyways.

I’ve spent a vast majority of my later teens here and being someone from South-East Asia, I feel extremely different from everyone here. I know from Western media and representation that I’m not at all a big person, I’m more medium sized. I have very wide hips, thick thighs and a big lower back, with a straight but proportionally small torso, a fairly wide and bony chest and torso, but big upper arms and small boobs. Everyone here is tiny in both height and weight and they are fairly petite and flat (in a good way) but still have fairly curved torsos. I know it sounds stupid knowing my dimensions but I feel so fat and burly and tall and large when I’m walking around everyone else. I feel like I only look good in clothes that accentuates my figure but I feel like I’m being overly promiscuous when I’m just trying to go about my daily life. For example, in high school, I would get dress coded for wearing the same length dress as some of my other classmates because it would look more provocative on me. I feel like I can’t ever look sophisticated and girly and small. I feel like I look so big and gross next to my guy friends, I can never just be petite and cute and elegant. I feel so terrible all the time because I know that, even if I lose weight, I’ll always have a bigger lower body that will prevent me from looking sophisticated. I guess the biggest issue is that when I try to buy clothes, the dimensions are never right for me. Clothes always fit so awkwardly on me because I’m not the typical consumer here. I always find myself buying XXL clothes just so that they will fit my thighs and hips. I guess I just don’t know how to dress myself, really. Does anyone have any tips? I’ve been really struggling recently :("

What in the heck! 

So, I'm here to start a thread of inverted triangle appreciation. What do you love about your body type?

Want to try something different?

Go outside and find a tree, any tree will work. Then, just notice it. Look. Don’t question or judge the tree. Accept it for exactly how it is. Maybe it gives you shade. Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe it grows food. Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe its branches are long, maybe they are shorter. Maybe there are birds in it. Maybe it holds a swing for your kiddo. Maybe it’s old. Maybe it’s brand new. It doesn’t matter. Let it be whatever tree it is without attaching anything to it or judging it.

Give that tree five minutes of your undivided attention, and then give it gratitude for the very simple reason that it is here.

**Do not read on until you’ve gone outside and looked at the tree for at least five minutes.** 

*Did you notice how the tree didn’t over complicate stuff?*

It stood there, being a tree. It was exactly where it needed to be, doing its job brilliantly. It didn’t beat itself up, trying to be something it isn’t. It was unapologetic and steadfast in its reality of being a tree.

For whatever reason, that tree is part of this world in this particular moment in time.

**And it is perfect.**

Ready for part two?

[Accept it for exactly how it is](https://cleanfooddirtygirl.com/accept-your-gorgeous-body-exactly-as-it-is-right-now-plus-whole-food-plant-based-banana-walnut-muffins/). Maybe it’s pink. Maybe it’s brown. Maybe it’s black. Maybe it has curves. Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe there are stretch marks, scars and birthmarks. Maybe it’s smooth. Maybe it has sags and dimples and wrinkles. It doesn’t matter. Let it be your body without attaching anything to it or judging it.

*Did you notice how your body didn’t over complicate stuff? Your thoughts might have, but your body didn’t.* 

It stood there, being your body. It was exactly where it needed to be, doing its job brilliantly. It didn’t beat itself up trying try to be something it isn’t. It was unapologetic and steadfast in its reality of being your body.

For whatever reason, your body is part of this world in this particular moment in time.

**And it is perfect.**

Allow your body to be like the tree. Let it do its job, unapologetically. With grace and perfect imperfection."

I've been in a larger body my whole life and I'm still working on recovering from not only my ED but just challenging the fatphobia I have within myself. One thing that really bothers me is when some of my friends who not only have been fat phobic around me but also have socially praised bodies tell me that i look good when i express my frustrations with my appearance/body. I know their intentions are good, but part of me is frustrated by the fact that I know they would hate being in my body."

Currently I'm dating guy, who is shorter and leaner than me.
We've been seeing each other for about two months now, but already heard some mean comments from people since we're quite atypical pair (eg. They are assuming that we are together because: him short, me fat, nobody else wanted to date us)
Height of my partner is not a problem for me at all, however I've been struggling with my plus-size body acceptance since I can remember, and I'm already 30 now.

Do you have any experiences with being in not really stereotypical, if we talk about bodies, relationship?

So i used to be a professional roller skater.I started skating at the age of 13 and absolutely loved it and still do but my coach always thought of me as fat and a failure and also always compared my body shape to other kids at the class and it made me feel sad but just because i loved to skate I never let it bother me, also I remembered he once called me a loser through cheering stands in a championship and I took it okay back then...fast forward.. I left skating at 15 because my grades were dropping and I wouldn’t win any championship so i dropped out but now that i think of it,it kills me to think that how could a coach call their students such stuff and it still makes me cry of how everyone made fun of me bcoz of my body. During lockdown I constantly kept thinking of how he and my so called friends at my skating class treated me and developed eating disorder and i just kept tracking my calorie intake and gave up everything i liked ti eat bcoz it had more calories. Few days ago I deleted my calorie calculator and looked at my body in the mirror and cried for 30 min on how much i hated it even after so much efforts and today’s finally after days I started to like my body not completely but getting rn the best feature of my body is my jiggly stomach 😌 I just wanna say is that if you have kids who train or coaches like this please stand up to them because it took away my complete confidence and self worth and it also made me quit that one sport i loved"

even the things that do fit are still somewhat ill fitting!!!! it’s driving me mad!! on top of the fact that you can’t try things on at the moment, i’m driving back and forth!! i know that primark clothes are not exactly the best quality so i know the sizes are hit and miss but honestly in general, it is so rare to find well fitting clothes as a woman. dressing for a woman’s body is so difficult. my boyfriend fits into literally everything he buys it’s ridiculous.

Neutral,"Tall girl tired of being told I’m tall  I’m (24F) 5’ 10” - I’m no professional athlete, but obviously I’m on the taller side and I have more of an athletic build. I’m not model skinny. I’ve got thicker thighs, a big butt, and broad shoulders. Since high school, I thought I was, in general, fairly confident about being a tall woman. I used to love the way it made me feel powerful and gave me a high vantage point in crowds. I don’t (anymore) feel threatened by the crowd of men who are obsessed with short girls. I thought I had become so resiliently secure about my height, that I’m surprised to find recently I’ve been so annoyed and at times almost hurt by frequent comments about my height. 

I think the recent comments have stemmed from the fact that I’ve met some people over Zoom in the last year (like coworkers and some people in a church community group), and upon meeting them in person for the first time, their initial (not ill-intentioned) comment is something along the lines of “WOW I had no idea you were so tall!” It’s just awkward for one thing, like how am I supposed to respond to that? “Yep, I’m a tall girl!”?? I don’t typically comment on someone’s appearance unless I’m complimenting their outfit, so it’s just a strange phenomenon to me that people feel comfortable saying such a thing. Like honestly, what response do they expect? I even had a coworker (very petite female) say “I don’t even understand how you find pants that fit.” I just wanted to say “Well, I’ve been shopping for pants for my body for the last 10 years so I’m pretty good at it,” but I always just end up laughing these things off or playing along like “oh girl it’s a struggle!” because I don’t want to be rude. It’s gotten to the point where when I see people for the first time who’ve previously only known me on the phone, I just KNOW they are sizing me up and overcome by an impression about my height. 

I think this has started to mess with my security and body-image, because apparently my height and stature is such a noticeable thing that people immediately feel the need to draw attention to it. For the most part it is rightly socially unacceptable to comment on someone’s weight in western cultures, so why is it fair game to bring up someone’s height? Aside from my coworkers and church people, my roommates have frequently commented on my height, as well as my friends, every guy I’ve ever been on a date with, random people in the grocery store, etc etc. Does anyone else relate, and how should I respond in these situations?? And how can I get over the way these interactions make me feel about myself? Maybe I’m overly sensitive?!"

I’m 16, turning 17 soon (I didn’t see any rules about age but if it missed it my apologies) and I struggle a lot with my body image when I’m around my mother, she likes to point things out to my face but recently she keeps bombarding me with comments telling me I have a ‘flat ass’ or ‘no ass’ and then makes fun of me for it! Types of comments like these are common with her I remember once in the 6th grade she told me my little sister was going to have bigger boobs then me (I’m not really sure why that matters when you’re in the 6th grade). This isn’t an isolated situation either, she has been commenting on my body since middle school and likes to tease me and use words referring to my body that she knows I don’t like, normal bodily functions like periods are a huge embarrassment due to how she has treated me in the past regarding them and now I can’t ask for help about it and can barely even tell my dad (I live with him) or talk to her when I need any of those products! Things like that are a huge embarrassment to me now and I hate it

I just wanted to reach out and express my confusion and frustrations to see if anyone had any advice how to handle this or had gone through something similar, once again this is my first time posting anything on Reddit and I’m just extremely frustrated with how my mother treats my body compared to my sisters. Thank you to anyone who may read this or comment on this I’m just at my wits end"
Neutral,"Body Acceptance Songs? Melon Cake- Demi Lovato  Not sure if any of you like pop music, but Demi had a new album come out lastnight in which she sings candidly about her struggles with mental health, drug addiction, and body image. This song “melon cake”[Melon Cake](https://youtu.be/jq9719LKw0w) is a certified bop in my book. It’s a huge FU to dieting and restricting and learning to love yourself again at every stage. I was curious what other body acceptance songs you all listen to?


A little background on the song if anyone is interested: In 2018, Demi posted a photo of her birthday cake, which was a watermelon covered in fat free whip frosting. In this song she blatantly says:
“And now I'm sayin' no more melon cakеs on birthdays. No more barricades in doorways. Finally get to do things my way” She also has another line: “Dear little me, I'm sorry that it took so long. But baby, you're free”
I love this line because it reminds me of how badly I wanted to love myself as a child, and now that I finally do I want to give her a huge hug. Anyways, have a listen if you enjoy catchy pop music!"

Neutral,"Dear teen trying to get that perfect body:  Have you tried counting calories? The keto diet? How about working out more? Have you tried skipping breakfast, that is always a winner. Look at how skinny your friend got this spring, don’t you wish that was you? What are we doing? All of this is pointless, so just put on a big sweatshirt and call it good.

So much of my time used to be spent counting calories and working out until I physically couldn’t anymore. There were times I would even work out on an empty stomach, resulting in sharp pains that took me to the floor, where I would lay for minutes at a time trying to grasp onto consciousness. My muscles were almost always in pain, my stomach was almost always empty.

I was conditioned to think that it would help me get the body I needed…wanted, as I was a little more “heavy-set” back then. My grandmother had pounded words into my head that ultimately led to eating disorder after eating disorder. I am *still* in recovery. My mom *still* has to scribble out the nutritional facts on food so that I’ll eat it without such a large amount of guilt that my chest gets tight. My grandma *still* makes comments. It is one of the hardest processes I have ever been through. And for what? Society’s image of a perfect body?

**No thanks.**

Like you, I so wish that I didn’t care. I so wish that my grandmother—and yours-- didn’t ask:

“Are you really going to eat all that?”

“Didn’t you already have some of that earlier?”

“Weight Watchers said…”

Maybe I shouldn’t have eaten it. Maybe I should have followed grandmother’s flawed system of calorie counting.

**Maybe I should have listened.**

The thing is, though, nothing ever changed. Had I listened or not, It is all a mental game.

So there you are, looking at yourself in the mirror, hating what you see. I’ve been there. It sucks.

While you were focusing on how imperfect you are, your body kept you alive.

Do you ever think about how crazy that is? All that your body can do? Your body has grown with you, been broken and rebuilt itself, carried you as far as you desire to go. It is a machine, and it is your own. 

So, why are you so worried about how it looks?

You are your worst critic, and there is absolutely no reason for you to be. Every detail, whether it be considered a flaw or not, is unique to you. The way the corners of your eyes crease when you smile, the snort that slips out when you are caught up in laughter, the freckles cover you from head to toe, even the scars you have from the scooter accidents as a child. It is not all about your size, because I can put money on the fact that people never worry about your weight when the room is being lit up by that gorgeous smile of yours. You are built exactly how you are supposed to be, in all of your glory. 

If Jessica from third period doesn’t like the way you look, that is her problem.

If that boy you have a crush on thinks you aren’t an absolute goddess, he for sure wouldn’t be good enough to chase after anyway.

Start living your life for yourself. Do what makes you happy.

Eat what you want. Don’t count those calories. Don’t restrict yourself from your favorite foods. Work out as much as you are comfortable with or not at all.

And above all else, NEVER skip breakfast.

You and all the beautiful uniqueness of your being are worthy of all the love in the world.

Stop. **You already have it.**"

Neutral,"I’ve hated my body my entire life.  I’ve hated my body my entire life, from the time I was five years old until now (54). I always thought I was too fat. It was never perfect enough. I listened to people make negative comments about my body and I believed them. I had it in my head that everything about my body was wrong and that I was a failure because it wasn’t perfect. 

Now I am looking back at pictures of myself, and realizing that I looked great. Why did I listen to them? Why didn’t I know that I looked fine? 

And now I really am very overweight, and going through menopause and some medical issues. And I know it really doesn’t matter that I am fat. My husband loves me, I have a good job, and great friends and family  

So I am beginning my journey of acceptance. No more thinking about diets and longing for a lithe body; I am going to buy clothes that fit instead of wearing ones that I think I should be able to wear. I will be thankful for all I have and know that in the end, the shape of my body does not matter one whit."

Neutral,"My whole life I never had a problem with my nose. Instragram changed that.  I never had a problem with my nose. I never even noticed that it was crooked. Apparently no one else noticed either. Now that I can see it in photos and videos it has started to bother me. Whenever I go on Instagram I see before and after a of people who got plastic surgery. I’d rather go back to accepting my nose the way it is than elect to have surgery but I’m having a hard time doing that.

Update: You guys are awesome. As someone suggested, I decided to check out Instagram reality, which is like an antidote to the brainwashing you get there. I took a good hard look in the mirror and realized that my nose does look better in real life and as long as I look happy I’m glad to be me. Thank you everyone for the advice and encouragement and for sharing your stories with me. My crooked nose tells a story and that’s okay. I’m not 100% okay with it, but I’m more okay with it than not. I’m going to spend the thousands of dollars on continuing education instead."

Disordered,"F The Scales  I had to get weighed today for an appointment. We alllll dread this. Mostly because society tells us as women to be 115 pounds or less. Also, we are in a pandemic and everyone has gained weight in some sense. Obviously working out is not a priority. I know I have gained weight but fortunately my clothes still fit and I don't believe I look that different than from before. Even if I did gain, so what. This time is extremely tough! I try to eat well and exercise a normal amount in order to take care of myself and body. To feel strong and have some energy. NOT for what society tells us we should look like but for how I want to feel and look. I do my best not to look at the scale because it does me no good and I obsess over the numbers. I tried to do that today but my curiosity got the best and I looked. I was shocked. It made no sense. The amount would deem that I would have had to go up a size or two in clothes. That I would look completely different than what I actually do. Of course, I started getting sad and beating myself up. Then, I had a moment of clarity. Scales are absolutely BS! A number does not define what my body looks like or who I am as a person! It does not define my beauty or my values. It does not define my character. Actually, that number doesn't define if I am fat, skinny, muscular etc. It is just an NUMBER! And a number that is irrelevant. I was livid at the fact that we have been conditioned to be so focused on this number when each body is different! Two people can weigh the exact same size and look completely different. I hate that we have been so consumed by weighing a certain amount and people have starved themselves to fit that way. Trust me, I did it too. I am not an expert in this but I wanted to share my thoughts on this topic because maybe someone else needs to hear it today. Please remember, you are worth sooooooo much more than a number on an electronic device. Every BODY is beautiful."

Neutral,"As a thin person, how can I be better about loving my body while not equating that self-love to my size?  I am a naturally lean and tall woman with a semi-athletic build. I’ve struggled with eating disorders in the past and am doing well now, but I’m having a hard time appreciating my body without being somewhat comforted that society deems me the “appropriate size”. I know that as I age, the way I look will inevitably change, and I don’t want to be so tethered to my shape and the way I look now if that makes sense.

Neutral,"I’m I overthinking things?  Lately I’ve been thinking about the past and I suddenly remembered something and it was when I went to a this bar and restaurant with my two friends. 

There was a big screen on the wall showing a hockey match and there were people behind us watching it. Me and my friends were expats and so we kind of stood out with our accents. 

I was a bit uncomfortable and thought they were staying at us and I kept turning around to see how many people were behind us as I struggle with anxiety. 

As me and my friends were talking I heard a man saying ‘she looks masculine’ this really stung as I have been called a man because I thought have a overly feminine body and I just realize it could have been my nose. I have a hooked nose and I have a fat head and a forehead that is strong and kind of sticks out. 

So I’m thinking it was because of that. Then I was thinking were they talking about my friend who doesn’t have a overly feminine face but her features are softer than mine so I don’t know it kind of hurt me because you start to doubt yourself and wonder does everyone think like this and I have to keep reminding myself that no not everyone thinks like this and it is only a few opinions of others.

Neutral,"Personal challenge: express appreciation and admiration instead of judgement or jealousy.  I have been struggling for the past few years with my body image and weight gain during COVID. As a result I find that this is becoming a strain on my relationship.

We live in a college town where women outnumber men 6:1. They seem to all be the beauty standard: tall, blonde, white and thin. There’s nothing wrong with fitting into these categories, I am just struggling with finding my body acceptance amidst it. As a result, when my BF and I are out in public I’ll start to shut down and become a bit overwhelmed with anxiety and too focused on whether or not he is checking them out. It’s so exhausting for both of us. 

So I’m going to challenge myself to compliment these women right out the gate for 30 days. Instead of being intimidated and jealous, I’m going to lean in and acknowledge their beauty and see if I feel any different about my own at the end. Check my ego and let go.

Neutral,"Trying to appreciate my weight gain  First time posting here, and I'm a little nervous.

I've suffered a lot of mental illness in my life, and for the past 6 years or so my disorders and the meds used to treat them made it difficult for me to get enough to eat. There were times I got so thin I didn't recognize myself in photos.

A few months ago I started a new medication, and it has helped me so much. My sleep, my mood, my relationships, my focus, EVERYTHING has improved so much, including my appetite and digestion. I am so grateful to have made it out of 2020 alive, and I have a lot of hope that things will only continue to get better for me in my mental health journey.

But I've gained like 50lbs on this new medication. Even though the people in my life would never say anything disparaging about my weight gain, I grew up in a really fatphobic household and have been working ever since to undo all those years of toxic messages. So the only judgement I've faced about my weight is coming from inside my own head, but there's a good deal of it.

I guess I'm just posting here to affirm to myself that my health matters so much more than my dress size, and to hopefully receive a little validation too. I try to think of my weight gain as a side effect of recovery, and to remind myself that being overweight and well is so much better for me than being skinny, sad, and starved. But it's easier said than done.

In fact, people stop me in the streets to exclaim and make known to me just how tall I am. At 6’2, I am a spectacle to behold as I reach for the cereal on the top shelf at the grocery store. People of all ages and stages stop to admire how “exotic” and “Amazonian” I am throughout my day. Every. Single. Day.

This is even more so true when I walk around with my husband. He’s about 2 inches shorter than me. “You’re so brave, I could never date a man who isn’t at least 3 inches taller than me.” That is what 95% of women have to say to me about it. If you are reading this and you have a vagina, please don’t deny it. You’re probably one of them. 

It’s 2021. Please stop the backhanded compliments about how tall I am compared to my soul mate, and please stop being so ridiculously shallow. I already have to buy all my pants and shoes online.

Neutral,"I started to be more confident!!  Some time ago i posted here about my SO being ashamed with me (you can check out the post on my profile if you want). Welp, i remember saying in the comments that I'd give him a second chance and whatnot, but I decided to listen to my gut feeling and to y'alls advice, so i ended it with that mf. If only it was that easy tho... It was a very...weird relationship. Close to the end of it, he started saying very hurtful things like ""I'm ashamed to go out with you"", ""my mom doesn't like you because you're fat"" (this leading up to him treating me like a piece of shit for too long), ""you should go on a diet or else blablabla"" etc etc, you get the jizz. 
Those things hurt me REALLY bad, because it was the first time i made myself vulnerable in front of someone, the first time i said ""fuck it"" and showed myself (both body and mind) just the way i am. The whole period before breaking up, my confidence was brought to the ground, i was miserable. I hated myself, i couldn't stand looking at myself in the mirror and when i did i asked ""why do i look like this?"". He also made it a point to mention that ""your personality is great, your looks are not doing you a favor tho"".
You can imagine how bad it hurt to hear those things from the person i loved, and you can also imagine that my dumbass didn't think that MAYBE he was the problem, so i decided to keep things going with him, promising I'd change, I'd exercise and I'd be looking my ""best"" for the summer. Ofc i lied and the way i was planning to lose all the weight was by starving myself.
After a while, he started talking to this girl, which he introduced to me as ""hot af, if you looked like her, with your personality, that would be perfect"". Y'all...when i tell you i fucking SNAPPED. I literally said ""no hold on"" and went on a rant on how he hurt me, how i didn't like this new chick, that he lied to me, that he ruined so many things for me (music, series, jewelry etc), brought my confidence to the fucking ground. He seemed very uninterested in what i said, but it felt good getting it out. We broke up. He kept messaging me for a while, i replied until my father pointed out ""is this what you really want to do with your time, after how dirty he did you?"".
So i stopped talking to him for good, started working on my confidence, on getting used to loving myself and myself ONLY. I accepted my body just the way it is, i am aware of the change that need to be made, but I'll do them for me and my health, not some mommy's boy. I'm out here, looking my best, feeling myself, showing myself off, improving my skills and personality. It's all coming together y'all!!!!

Anyway, this was really long, but the bottom line is: i know some relationships are very toxic, mine wasn't nearly as bad as others, but it doesn't take much for a person to bring you down. Some people get to know you and your insecurities, then use that to get in your head, ruin your self image and manipulate you into thinking stuff like ""well, I'm shit, but they love me like this, even though they treat me bad. I'll stay"". I know it's hard but you need to remember that you deserve better and nothing bad will happen if you choose to love yourself. It's especially hard to tell that someone is bringing you down when they try to sugarcoat the mean shit they say and use the excuse ""i wanted the best for you"".

TL;DR: I broke up with the guy that ruined my confidence and now I'm finally getting back on my feet. :)"

Neutral,"How do I politely tell my future mother in law that I don't appreciate her comments about my weight?  My fiance's parents came to visit us last weekend.  They last saw us on Christmas.  His mother made SEVERAL comments about how I've lost weight.   I don't own a scale, but I'm fairly certain I have not lost weight in he 6 weeks since I saw her, but I have slimmed a bit since March.  My fiance and I have been trying to be healthier as a couple, and quarantine has actually been good for us because we made a point to go on hikes every weekend and we cook at home more, but my goal has not been to lose weight.   While I am a bit self conscious of my body and the weight I have put on in the past 5 years, I am quite happy with how my wedding dress looks on me and  I do not have a goal to ""slim down"" for my wedding.   I'm trying to shift my mindset to loving my body as it is by feeding it healthy foods and exercising it in ways that bring me joy. 

I know she means well, but the excited comments on how I've lost weight send the message that there was something wrong with me before.   I fluctuate for many reasons and I don't need her commentary on it.    Any advice?"

Neutral,"Journalist hopeful for people to interview for story about ""Zoom Dysmorphia""  Good day,

I've consulted with the moderators of this forum and have been given permission to post this solicitation for interviewees. I thank you for your consideration.

My name is Michael Stahl and I'm a writer in New York City \[[www.michaelstahlwrites.com](https://www.michaelstahlwrites.com/)\]. I'm working on a story for InsideHook \[[www.insidehook.com/author/michael-stahl](https://www.insidehook.com/author/michael-stahl)\] about Zoom Dysmorphia, a new category of body dysmorphia where people who engage with video-conferencing platforms grow disgruntled with the way they look on camera. If you search around the internet, you'll find it's leading to an uptick in plastic surgery requests.

If you are someone who's struggling with Zoom Dysmorphia and would be open to an interview about it, I'd really appreciate the chance to talk. You can remain anonymous if you like, and though I prefer phone calls, interviews can be arranged in other ways, like through text or email messaging.

Please let me know a few details of your symptoms and some steps you may have taken to combat them in a message on Reddit or in an email through my website. If you look through my work, you'll find that I report from a place of empathy and sensitivity, and this process won't be any different.

I thank you again for reaching out if you feel so inclined.

Best, Michael"
Neutral,"My roommate has body dysmorphia?  so i’m a freshman in college. my roommate is 5’9 and pretty obsessed with the gym and the way his body looks. he’s told me he has body dysmorphia and doesn’t like the way it looks (he has like a bird chest), but he wasn’t *actually* serious about it. i just thought he wanted to improve how he looks like a normal person. 

it wasn’t until i found out he’s had a negative image of his body since he was a kid, thinking he was fat when he was a very normal weight, that i found that he *really* dislikes his body. 

any advice i could give him to come to terms with how he looks?"
Neutral,apple-shaped body influencer/YouTuber?  I’ve always wanted to find a fashion influencer on YouTube or Instagram that has my body shape- thin and apple shaped. My stomach sticks out a good deal from the side and it makes it hard to find clothes that flatter me.  Body acceptance feels like it would be easier if I had clothes I felt good in. Any names or YouTube channels would be amazing!!
Neutral,Does everyone look back at old pictures of themselves and say I wasn't as ugly as I thought?  Seems like it's a common theme. Mostly in my teens and early 20's was when I hated myself which makes sense because we're changing a lot. It's just funny how you could think you look so hideous only to realize you were actually pretty good looking back in the day. Man if I could just have known that back then!
Neutral,"Went back to acceptance and loving  So I feel like I have recovered from my ED but doesn’t mean I don’t still struggle with body acceptance issues.

Anyway, i was dieting this week with plan to gain my body type and finally became my image. As if the Xth time will change anything. And I didn’t realise I was stressed so I was restricting and over exercising for a week when my body crashed today and binged. Then I realised I couldn’t repeat this cycle as it wasn’t worth it. And I just gave up my diet. As I would rather be happy and love myself then keep trying to change myself and never be happy with who I am. 

And if that means I am not liked my certain guys then so what there are many beautiful sizes with partners so size doesn’t matter, I’ll find someone.

Neutral,"My face is extremely asymmetrical, and I know its normal but I was just wondering if it being this drastic is normal?  So I've been told multiple times that I have conventially attractive features(strong jawline, pretty eyes) but I constantly at least spend half an hour a day looking at my face because of how asymmetric it is. One of my ears is slightly smaller than the other, one of my eyebrows is slightly higher than the other, my chin is slightly slanted to the left, one of my cheeks is slightly than the other, one of my eyes is slightly lower than the other, and the tip of my nose is to the right of the middle of my lips. People say they havent noticed, but I cant help but feel disgusted by my face whenever I look at it closely. Is there something I can do or something I can think about?"
Neutral,"Does everyone take lots of pictures of themselves on their phone? Does this have to do with body image?  I notice I'll go on binges where I'll take a bunch of selfies and mirror pics. I can't give a straight forward answer as to why but I feel it's some sort of obsession with how I look. I might be trying to look all sexy but deep down I feel not good enough.  I know I can't ever be satisfied but I still do it, there's some sort of craving all the time. I notice I'm not the only one who takes lots of pictures and have similar poses.

Some would freak out at first (eek people can see my lips aren't bright red! Now I'm shorter without my heels!) but they would totally get used to it eventually.

Neutral,"Feeling really guilty for accidentally giving a backhanded compliment  EDIT: She has since replied to my apology and said that she wasn’t personally offended by my comment but some people may be. Which is fair enough. 

A girl on tik tok was showing an insecurity she has of her body, back fat. This has been my biggest insecurity about my body so I wanted to compliment her on doing so. 

I said ‘It makes me so happy to see people talking about back fat because it’s my biggest insecurity and I never see anyone with as much back fat as me’. 

It wasn’t until she replied that my comment was offensive that I realised how backhanded it sounds. It sounds like I’m saying that she has a lot of back fat when that’s not what I meant, I actually have a lot more back fat than her. 

What I meant was that I never see anyone with as much back fat as me, that’s why it’s such an insecurity of mine. But it makes me really happy to see people talking about it. 

I’ve apologised and explained myself but I just wanted to share this because compliments might not sound how you intend them to. Things can get taken the wrong way if you don’t word them carefully enough. I have BDD and the thought of making anyone feel bad about their body breaks my heart. 

I should’ve just been a bit more considerate when writing my comment and now I have to pay the price by feeling a bit guilty because of it."

I did this so much that I trained myself to believe i didn't look good.For the longest time I really couldn't stare at myself more than a few seconds without getting anxiety.

I actually think staring in the mirror and facing my fear is what finally got me to accept myself. Like this is what you look like. I have stared a little too long and thats freaky but just enough to say this is what you look like.

I still have trouble looking at a flawed person but im a lot better than before. For once i can see someone i like and that isn't something ive felt in a while,before puberty tbh. Anyways i didn't realize how much this affected my life but im glad I faced my fears. I feel free."

Neutral,"Imma break an ingrained comic rule, and have a plus sized MC  This is something I only recently thought about. I love comics, but most don’t represent body acceptance at all. Even if it would make more sense in the story. You mostly only see the ideal body type.

I thought it would make more sense for me to write my warrior Princess MC as a plus size woman because their lands are more bountiful as far as food goes. They have plenty of animals to kill, and their crops flourish.

It’s also a bit more realistic, because back then irl that was a sign of wealth and was not looked down upon at all. Although it’s still fantasy, so I don’t really care about being historically accurate.

I feel like if we as a society began representing different body types more, than there wouldn’t be so much of a toxic negative stigma around it. So I’m gonna do it. As an author my writing can make a change. Writers and authors do that all the time. They’ll write in their own personal views into fictional stories. For better or for worse, but I’m going for the better."
Neutral,"Body neutrality has been wayyyy more helpful for me than trying to convince myself that I’m conventionally beautiful  Okay so I am not disabled or plus size, and I have a lot of privilege there. There are many people who would say that there are elements of my body that are conventionally attractive.

However, after struggling with an eating disorder and agonizing dissatisfaction with my face, I discovered body neutrality. And for me it is not being “neutral” about my body. 

Body neutral usually just means not thinking much about your body, but for me it also means that no body is inherently more beautiful than another. We just have whatever body we have, and the aesthetic value assigned to that body is entirely socially constructed. ENTIRELY. THERE IS BARELY ANY SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR IT. 

And THIS is why we should be neutral about the way our bodies look and not think about it too much. Our bodies are wonderful meatsuits that do lots of cool shit and allow us to live, even when we are disabled and not able to live the same way that others do. Being pretty whatever that means is not even on the list of your body’s priorities"

Disordered,"Anyone else struggle with very large breasts? Any tips for body acceptance?  Hello everyone! I would like to start by saying I am a 36K in bras 36H in the UK. I have had very large breasts for my frame since a young age and when I was much slimmer I was a 32H. It’s been a couple years and after putting on some weight it feels like it all goes there. I’ve always felt extremely insecure about them especially the attention that comes with them. I usually wear baggier stuff to hide them and it feels like everytime I wear something for form fitting or lower cut it seems like someone always comments.   But I am trying to make peace with them as I love clothes and fashion and would love to wear different things. It feels like nothing ever looks right on me because of them which hurts my self esteem and I feel like I have rather cartoonish proportions. It feels like even when I wear stuff that people with large breasts recommend I look ridiculous. While I’m pursuing a breast reduction right now, until that gets sorted out I would like to enjoy dressing. Being in the r/abrathatfits subreddit has made me realize a lot more people than I thought have my bust and even bigger & my bra fits great thanks to them. I feel like a lot of people with D cups try to give me advice on dressing but there’s a very big difference between us and while I know they mean well and appreciate it, it’s a bit different. Those are still large breasts of course but you know what i mean. I’m trying to get used to wearing more form fitting clothing and shutting down people who comment but if any of you have any support or tips as someone with a very large bust or knowing someone who does, I would really appreciate it.

Neutral,"That moment he falls for you and then changes his mind because you’re fat.  I 28(F) befriended a 30(M) that I met online in September, so we’ve been talking on the phone daily for 4 months or so. I’ve clued him in a couple times that I was a bigger girl, just casually in conversation. These conversations have been deep, meaningful, hilarious, clean and overall wholesome. I have had feelings since around the end of October, so when he confessed to me on Thanksgiving that he had feelings, I was overjoyed and I told him that I’d liked him for a while. We FaceTimed for the first time not long after, like a couple days after and then it seemed like he backed way off. I can’t help but feel like I didn’t live up to the version of me that he had in his head. We still talk daily and I still like him, but it never progressed to anything more than friends. I also feel like he overuses the word “friend” with me now. If you’re a fellow fat chick, I’m sure you’re familiar with this feeling. Just sucks. I know not everyone will find you attractive, but I guess I’m just really disappointed because now the version that I had of him in my head is destroyed too. I feel like he’s shallow. Another one bites the dust, I guess. *sigh*"
Neutral,"Is it possible to have a good relationship with food and my body while also wanting to be attractive?  I have been super dedicated to wellness and improving my mind and health. However, I have always taken a lot of pride in my looks - I know that sounds messed up, but it's deeply engrained in me and is hard to let go of. At the same time, i feel so tied to food and my body that it's unhealthy. Is there a way to find a balance?"
Neutral,Saw pictures of myself when I was younger and realize I was handsome but all I remember is how ugly I felt during that time. Did I really just beat up my self-esteem to the ground?  It's amazing how you feel inside doesn't match what you look like on the outside. I'm pretty sure all I did was notice my flaws instead of what was good. When I look at myself in the mirror all I'm doing is looking for imperfections not realizing what good traits I have. Your mind can play tricks on you all because you say harsh things to yourself. Now I'm more accepting and better understand my body but man is it easy to fall into the trap of not liking yourself.

Feel Good Friday asks ""What made you feel good this week?""

Sundays will be ""Inspiration Day"", where you can bring up a person, a meme, image, video, art, link, or thought that's inspired you recently.  (The no selfies/body pictures rule will remain in effect.)

Neutral,"2021: This Year We Resolve  #This year we resolve to stop hating our bodies.

- We reject the idea of the ""ideal"" or ""perfect"" body. 

- We reject the idea that our body is **TOO**.  Too fat, thin, short, tall. Too different from what society tries to say, which changes like the wind.

- We reject the	idea that our body's imperfections make us less of a person.

- We reject the idea of what ""diet culture"" tell us: that we *should* or *shouldn't* eat this or that, that we have to restrict what we eat, that we have to punish ourselves if we eat ""wrong.""

- We reject the ideas that body weight is the same as health, that being fat or thin is automatically healthy or unhealthy, and that our body weight defines our looks or our value.

- We reject the idea that we have to change our bodies to have a good body. **ALL** bodies are good bodies.


#We Accept Ourselves

- We accept that we don't always have to love ourselves, but we can find peace and acceptance.

- We accept our body's imperfections.



- We accept that we are a unique being on the planet.

- We accept that our differences in our bodies are what make us unique.

- We accept ourselves, as we are, and there's nobody more important to
accept that.

Neutral,"Does everyone look at themselves in the mirror and judge themselves?  For some reason I feel only certain people do but I like to think it's more common than people think. Of course we can't see what people do behind doors but I thought I was the only weirdo taking constant selfies of myself and realized lots of others do it to. I'm guessing if you're more confident you spend less time looking at yourself, it's just a matter of whats going on in your mind as you're doing so. I wish I could stop judging myself but I realize it will never go away entirely. I guess one of the reasons to have a mirror in the first place is to recognize your flaws so you can fix it."

Neutral,"Teaching myself to sew is challenging me to be comfy with my body  one of the reasons I wanted to learn to sew is to make my own wedding dress. I'm currently in the design process rn. I also love owning one of a kind clothing and want to customize my entire wardrobe at some point. 

Additionally clothing has often been frustrating because I am not shaped in the conventional fashion shape despite being a medium size. I'm very boxy, short waist and most of my curves are from the front and back not on the sides lol. This makes finding nice garments that fit my body in ways that i find appealing annoyingly difficult sometimes as I've had to teach myself hand alteration since i was like 16. 

I'm learning to sew garments for myself I've developed a new appreciation and sense of ease for my body. mostly because something i noticed is that in couture sewing everything EVERYTHING is about illusion. Dress forms are PADDED to the SHAPE OF THE CLIENT and you know what???? all these rich couture fuckers are just as ""lumpy"" as you and me!!! because that's what bodies are! soft cute meat and flesh bags! Even historical clothing. they weren't all waifs (tho some were) there was structure and padding and MORE LIES built into corsets 😅. There were garments let out with little stitches and even paneling. 

That shape, that ""silhouette"" is all about fit, and construction and little secret lies 😅. so it doesn't fucking matter if i don't have a 25 inch waist to match my 34 inch bust cuz darts, lining, underlining, boning and petticoats HAVE GOT MY BACK.

Also low key i may switch to wearing nothing but 1940s style circle skirt dresses from now on because my God they are fucking comfy and make me feel good. And what's the point of learning all this shit if i can't do whatever the fuck i want.

Needless to say learning the art of clothes has made me spent more time with my body and its structure and triggering things like measurements. I have also come to see measurements in a creative sense and not a ""diet and exercise sense"". I spend more time bending the world to fit me rather than bending me to fit the damn world. And fuck it if my body changes it changes! This is why we build ease into the seam allowance!"

Neutral,"I’m obese  I have always thought I was fat my entire life (even at five years old!!) even though I wasn’t. Looking back at pictures, I can see now that I wasn’t fat at all. 

But there’s no denying it now (I’m 54 and over 200 pounds) - and I don’t want to upset anyone by saying this - but how do you stop hating yourself for how you look? Because I can’t deny it anymore; I loathe myself. 

Why can’t I be like some people who love themselves no matter their weight? Logically I know ones weight is not important - my husband is overweight too, and I still love him and it doesn’t matter to me - but why can’t I hold myself to the same standard? 

What is wrong with my stinkin’ thinkin’? 😕 How do I stop this?"

Neutral,"Repairing my relationship with exercise  I used to exercise out of a net-negative obligation, so I stopped going to the gym unless I wanted to. However, as we're moving into what will surely become a second COVID  lockdown, I've noticed that working out is FABULOUS for my mental health, especially since I can't get out much in the first place. However, doing so is sometimes hard because I think I go back to old thinking habits about how I could use my workouts to change my body to make it more ""ideal."" I'm also a little bummed that I'm not as strong/fast as I used to be, but I'm trying to turn that around by celebrating what my body is capable of doing \*today\*. 

For those of you who work out regularly, how have you created a healthy relationship with fitness? What are some ways I could rethink goalsetting so I'm focused more on chasing endorphins rather than chasing a look? Are there any Youtubers/Instagrammers creating body positive content that I should check out?"

Thanks to people [making suggestions and voting on them](https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/jtgsc0/wanted_ideas_for_regular_positive_posts/), we'll shortly be adding regular posts to encourage, inspire, and support with more positivity.

Neutral,"Anyone grow up with a Mom who constantly bashed her own looks.... And then you started to look like her?  This is why sometimes I feel like I will never get over my self image issues. It's so deeply ingrained in me. 

I feel awful about this but to this day I cringe when people say I look like my Mom because I've only ever heard her talk poorly of her appearances. She always tells me, ""our body type is so similar"", and it makes me feel like shit because I grew up learning from her that she had a ""bad"" body. At the same time she's always saying it's ridiculous that I think I'm ugly, that I'm objectively beautiful, etc. 

I also once brought up the idea of being a musician to her, just dreaming about it when I was a teenager. Her response was something along the lines of, ""I would say you shouldn't pursue that if you were ugly. But you just might have enough looks to make it work!"". Not the talent, not the grit, not the brains. The looks. No wonder I put so much emphasis on it today. It's the little things that stick with you, I swear.

The worst part is I know none of it is malicious so it's hard to be mad :("

Neutral,"How learning about the male gaze taught me to stop hating myself  This particularly pertains to women, but if you're a guy struggling with body image, and this idea of being watched pertains to you, I hope it helps.

“Women constantly meet glances which act like mirrors reminding them of how they look or how they should look."" In John Berger's *Ways of Seeing*, he ""argues that a woman “is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself."" 

Margret Atwood: ""Male fantasies, male fantasies, is everything run by male fantasies? Up on a pedestal or down on your knees, it's all a male fantasy: that you're strong enough to take what they dish out, or else too weak to do anything about it. Even pretending you aren't catering to male fantasies is a male fantasy: pretending you're unseen, pretending you have a life of your own, that you can wash your feet and comb your hair unconscious of the ever-present watcher peering through the keyhole, peering through the keyhole in your own head, if nowhere else. You are a woman with a man inside watching a woman. You are your own voyeur.”

Viv Albertine: “For sixty years I've been shaped by men's point of view on every aspect of my life, from history, politics, music and art to my mind and my body – and centuries more male-centric history before that. I'm saturated with their opinions. I can think and see like a straight white man. I can look at a woman and objectify her, see her how a man sees her.""

Put this way, if I never had to confront my own image ever again; if i lived in a world with no mirrors and body shape had no value, would I still want to lose weight the way I've been trying to lose for the last 10 years?(And I'm fucking 19!) The answer is ""No."" The same way I don't like to wear make-up because it makes me uncomfortable, I don't want to eat 1150 calories everyday. I'm tired of hating my body for reasons I don't even know. I had been telling myself that I wanted to lose weight ""for myself,"" but I don't mind. I eat food that I like and make me feel good, and so everything else: Does. Not. Matter. I've been a women with a man inside me watching myself and I am so tired of this, I've lost so many years, so many moments, so much energy, so much MONEY, on pleasing the man who lives inside me, watching me. On pleasing the women who have learned to think like men, watching me. I'm going to treat my body the way I would if no one was watching. My body has survived so much, it's time I give myself a break."

Disordered,"I need some encoragement TW: ED  So, I decided to order some clothes becuase I have gained some weight and I am not really liking how some of my current clothes are looking. I have been wanting to create a personal style and I want to style myself in the body I have and not spiral into the mindset that I cant have this style because I am fat. I got the clothes today and I ordered a size 18, normally I am a size 16, but I wanted some extra room becuase I wanted to feel confortable in these jeans. I went off that I fit a 16 in Old navy and so I ordered a 18 in GAP and they do not fit and I am devistated. They were these cute mom jeans and they are way to small. Its really rought because I already have a lot of bofy dysmorphia and I kind of wnat to go back to just not even trying ti style myself. I also want to revert back to my ED and just not eat anything. It is so fucking upsetting and I know its dumb to complain about it and I know my self worth is not tied up in my body size, but it feels like a blow to my self confidence. I just want to wear clothes I feel good in but I just can not seem to manage that. Is there anyone who can offer me advice on what to do? I have a really hard time shopping becuase it is very triggering for me and online is a lot easier. (I used to be dragged to stores and forced to try on all these clothes and I find it really triggering for my ED)"

Neutral,"Wanted: Ideas for regular positive posts  I'd like to crowdsource ideas for a bunch of weekly posts
that are designed to encourage positive content.

Unlike the daily negative post, this would not be required - if
people want to post positive content outside these posts, it's
encouraged. The more positivity here, the better!

The idea is that instead of a daily ""positivity"" post we do some
specifically themed thing on specific days - we can try 2 or 3 to
start, unless there's a pile of ideas.  An idea might be a ""What made
you feel good this week?"" on Fridays.  (You don't have to specify a
day with an idea.)


So, this is how this will work:

**- All top comments must be ideas for a weekly post.** Anything else will be removed. You can leave comments on top comments, though, if you have thoughts on them.

**- Ideas must fit the rules/ideals of this sub.**

**- If you like an idea, give it an upvote.**  Votes are not visible to avoid influencing people.

**- If you want to discuss this overall idea, please use the stickied thread.**


I want to hear your ideas!"

Neutral,"Can you have trauma about physical activity?  I’m 27 and I feel I’ve gotten pretty far in my journey with body acceptance. Like most, I have my days, etc, etc, but overall I’m okay being in this body. 

I’ve been working from home due to the pandemic since March and my activity level has gone way way down. I wasn’t a super active person even before, but my job kept me on my feet and I live in NYC so I walked a lot. 

Now, however, I rarely leave my house so I am barely moving. I want to get more physically active for the first time in my life *truly* just for my health. The problem is, any time I think about trying a new physical activity (biking, running, dance, etc) I feel like my brain automatically panics and I’m thrown back into all the years where I was doing it simply to lose weight. 

I remember I used to enjoy (I think—hard to separate out sometimes) running, and so I googled “running for out of shape beginners” and the moment I started reading it I just started crying. I think I feel scared that I will “fail” like I “used to” even though I know since I don’t have a goal BUT my health, that’s not possible. 

Has anyone experienced something similar or have any ideas on how to get back into it or just work through it mentally? I know a lot of people will probably suggest just taking walks, but it’s hard for me to motivate myself to do that when I know it’s so minimal. (Although I know, still better than nothing).

Any thoughts, feelings, or advice are appreciated."
