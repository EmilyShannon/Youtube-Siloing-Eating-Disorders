I have been recovering from a restrictive eating disorder for about three years now. I nearly died. I have returned to a healthy weight and have been slowly developing a better relationship with food. It has been difficult because a lot of my thought patterns surrounding eating have been deeply rooted since I was a child and had dieting and restricting reinforced to me all my life.\n\nCurrently, I am living with the best partner I could have ever imagined. They\'re wonderful in every way, and they\'ve been pretty supportive of my ED recovery over the past year we\'ve been together. Last year they were in a motorcycle accident and had to be hospitalized and put on a special diet which made them gain some weight since they were no longer exercising as much. They\'ve always been very fit and lean, exercise and healthy eating is important to them. Which is great in my opinion! They have a great relationship with their body and health.\n\nAfter their accident, their body has not 100% recovered. They still have stomach sensitivities and fallen off with their exercise routine. They will need to slowly work their way back into it if they want to be back where they were and it\'s frustrating for them. I\'ve tried my best to support and encourage them because they told me this is important to them, but I made it clear I do struggle with conversations surrounding weight loss and dieting. I told them that I\'m happy to help cook healthy food and encourage exercise but calorie counting, keto, etc. are too triggering for me.\n\nThis was fine for awhile, but my partner didn\'t see much progress. They finally told me that they needed to drop X amount of weight by the end of the month because they needed to fit into their suit for an upcoming race. The motorcycle suit is currently a bit too small because it is a year old and has not been adjusted since their accident. The suit itself is worth well over fifteen-hundred dollars so it\'s not plausible to get a new one, and it cost about five-hundred to get it retailored. It wouldn\'t be done in time either if they took it to be retailored. This is their safety gear, and the same type of gear that saved their life in their previous accident so it\'s vital that they have it fitting properly for race day.\n\nThis race is very important to them and I want to support them. However, this level of weight loss they\'re asking me to support would probably require a serious diet. That is not something I feel comfortable with. Additionally, I cook \\~85% of the meals so now I\'ve been obsessing over "is this going to help them lose weight?" and falling back into this calorie counting side. It\'s begun to weigh on me because I\'ve started body checking myself, weighing myself, etc. and in order to look at recipes I\'ve fallen back into diet culture. It\'s devastating and I can feel myself being triggered and slipping back into old habits.\n\nI want to support my partner because they\'ve made clear this is important to them. Their desire to diet is not unhealthy or rooted in any ED, it\'s purely related to their hobbies. I just don\'t know how to support them without simultaneously triggering myself.

So I’ve had eating disorders for eight years, since I was fourteen(anorexia, B.E.D). But even younger than that I had disordered eating or I was noticing other girls bodies at the age of nine for example (!) and I remember feeling good about being skinnier than them, which is mind blowing since I was just a child. So for some reason it feels like this has been with me forever. Now I consider myself recovered, I have food freedom, my weight does not fluctuate, I can enjoy food, my metabolism is better than ever. BUT there are days that my mood just drops if I feel I have a “fat” day to the point of having a heavy breakdown ( I believe I have body dysmorphia) and if I lose weight unintentionally there’s always a boost of confidence. I’ve also noticed that when I am less active, my appetite drops and even I get nauseous when I eat ( which I believe is a subconscious reflex of an underlying fear of weight gain). Also when I am stressed my appetite drops to the point I don’t feel hunger at all ( also I believe a coping mechanism to get a sense of control). In all of these situations I try to eat no matter what to keep my metabolism going and to just stay healthy. THE QUESTION IS: Do you think all of these are normal?

Hi, for some background to my situation I am recovering from an eating disorder. I had anorexia for about a year that switched to binge eating and then bulimia. I stopped purging and have been eating consistent meals, as well as eating what I crave (from my pantry since I'm broke lol). I went through extreme hunger already so I know it's not that. I had really bad binges for a while. I've been able to stop the emotional binges and listen to my body but my body gets hungry a lot and I just want food a lot of the time. I will eat so much throughout the day and it's not even junk, mostly healthy foods. Today I ate an orange, two apples, and two peaches because I wanted them, but doesn't that seem excessive? The problem is I'm eating a lot, like A LOT. I've had four eggs today, two as an after-dinner snack. I eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and multiple snacks in between. I feel in control but I'm so uncomfortable with the amount. And I still feel immense guilt no matter what I eat. I'm gaining weight, which is inevitable and good because I'm still a tiny bit underweight but it's happening fast. I'm afraid it's from boredom so I've been doing more hobbies but sometime's I'll stop what I'm doing to get a snack. Some nights I can't sleep until I eat something. My body needs the 12-hour fast when I'm sleeping but that isn't happening. I'm afraid I'm screwing up my body. I'm also afraid I'm turning into a food addict. Maybe I need more self-control but I'm afraid if I try to restrict I'll fall back into extreme restriction and I don't want to go through the whole mess of obsessing over food and hunger binges again.

I mentioned it to my therapist and he said it’s a common BPD thing but we didn’t go further into detail as I had more pressing things to discuss with him. \n\nAnyway, I have always binged on food and struggled greatly with body image issues/dysmorphia. Often it was a case of binging for days/weeks then going on a strict diet (my favourite was no carbs or the 5 bite diet). Because of this, my weight was constantly fluctuating. However now, since experiencing something very traumatic a few years ago, food has become an even bigger comfort for me and I don’t get the periods where I stop anymore. I will binge more or less everyday unless I am distracted/busy. I feel powerless, it’s like I physically can’t stop myself even though I know it’s bad for me and that I will feel horrible after but it’s like a compulsion. I don’t even binge for the taste of the food. It’s like eating is the only time I feel like I don’t have to think about anything else and can just switch my brain off. \n\nI can’t eat in front of people, I eat in secret, I live with housemates & not my parents, and I still tip toe around when I get takeaways because I feel insane embarrassment.

She is, at this point, average or a little heavier than average, but not at all overweight. However, she has started skipping lunch and probably breakfast, never eating snacks at all, not allowing herself any sweet food, and refusing to eat in restaurants.

My mom used to make sure my sister always had lunch, but now she doesn\'t care that she always skips it. I think my sister may have also been throwing up her food, although I\'m not sure of this.

The thought of eating solid food is equivalent to the thought of eating poo, it\'s a real stretch but that\'s what I thought of it. The taste is just so damn unexplainable, rather unstomachable (All pork,beef,chicken meat makes me gag) and DON\'T even get me started with FISH because that\'s literally the worse one of them all and literally the only thing I can eat is soup with rice, fried rice (plain fried rice cooked with onions and NEVER with hotdogs or carrots or anything other than rice, garlic) + noodles when available. The taste of meat, the texture, EVERYTHING makes me want to vomit and besides those I can\'t even eat bread, EVEN PEANUT BUTTER (When I said EVERYTHING, I meant it).\n\n Then when I was about six or so, I learned how to eat oatmeal, chocolate rice porridge and I stopped picking out the onions when I\'m eating.

I learned that I could actually eat eggs like scrambled fried eggs, boiled eggs (preferably not with the yellow part but I can eat it too).

Eggs were a huge discovery for me and it ignited a fire to try and eating other things but to no success.\n\nAge 14-15 is when the pandemic hit, there weren\'t really much of an improvement.

I would always eat the same meal ( cooked spinach and chicken for so long or some sort of prawn meal) Weight gain was always something on my mind. I was definitely obsessed. If I had a ‘fatty meal’ I would detox until I thought I was skinny enough. I remember punching so many belt holes but thinking it was not enough. I definitely had body dysmorphia because I always thought I was gaining weight while everyone told me I looked thin. I remember once it was my friends birthday and that’s when I ate properly.

No. It’s not a choice.\n\nHave you ever walked barefoot on the wet grass, in the early hours of a morning, to an apple tree upon which the fruit hangs low and sways heavy with juice, dew-dappled, like sequins of a little girl’s bow?\nAnd then, have you reached up, as easy as one, two, three you tugged it off the branch, the droplets slid down your fingertips, down your elbow, your teeth snapped the skin with a loud crunch. For an interval you simply stood there, relishing the burst of juice that filled your mouth.\nI have.\nOur apples come out late summer, early fall, when the incessant susurration of cicadas that always herald summer heat, dissipates, and the air is then held by the gentle trilling of crickets, and the occasional screeching of blue jays instead.\nOur Arkansas Black are tart, sweet and tangy. Their flavor is sharp, with nodes of vanilla and cinnamon. They are small, swarthy, with flushes of yellow on the sun-shy bits.\nThere is nothing like the freshly picked apples in the early morning of a day.\nMy life is that apple. It has everything one should want: sweetness, crispiness, tang, crunch, spice, sourness, with cherry notes on top. There are endless possibilities, and the whole world is laid out before me, for my picking. But most importantly, I have freedom. I have the freedom, to choose.\nI could just reach out, and as easy as one, two, three I could pluck that apple off of the tree. I could have it all, should I choose.\nSo why? Why am I not making the choice to choose it?\nWhy am I not choosing life? Why am I choosing death instead? Why am I not choosing to feed my body, why am I choosing to feed the hunger instead?\nIt is so easy, just swallow that apple. SWALLOW IT, damn it! Why can’t I simply… let it go?\nOne day, feeling largely discouraged, Ron reached out to one of the therapists we were working with, sharing his frustration with her.\n“It is her body, her life, her decisions.” She told him.\nBut that is, quite literally, an insult to Anorexia. And it’s dumbing it down to the highest degree.\nBecause no. It’s not a choice.\nNo one chooses Anorexia. Not conscientiously. No one chooses the hurt. The deprivation. The torment. The despair. No one chooses to cut, to purge, to starve, to break yourself anew every day. It’s not a diet you can simply turn on and off anytime you ever so wish. It’s not an act of attention-seeking. It’s not a pastime hobby. And you don’t do it just for the heck of it.\nYou don’t choose to lay in bed for hours, with hunger pangs so bad that they twist your stomach into knots. You don’t choose to chew your food and never have it.\nThat proverbial cash register sound dings in my head, every time any food item finds its way into my mouth:\n1 medium-sized strawberry- cha-ching! x calories…\n6 blueberries- cha-ching! x calories…\n3 almonds- cha-ching! x calories…\n1 Oz chicken- cha-ching! x calories…\nThe bill adds up very quickly for a serial Anorexic’s daily intake.\nSTAY IN CONTROL. The echo blares as loud as a bugle sounding reveille in the early a.m. It buzzes deafeningly in my ears like a blood-feeding insect:\nbzzz… weight weight weight weight weight weight weight weight gain = you lost control, you big fat loser you… bzzz…\nChaos starts with this one bite, and then, like dominos, you’ll see, a panoply of perfectly awful results will ensue. One, after, another.\nThis strawberry… tastes… like… heaven. I am chewing it carefully, slowly, methodically, with intention. And the smell, oh, the smell. My mouth engorges with the juice, a rush of saliva. I know I already had my ‘allotment’ for the day, but God, I want to have it too. Perhaps just this once. Perhaps just this time… SPIT IT… SPIT IT OUT YOU FOOL! I apologize for screaming, but you know, that’s how I roll. And the rules must obeyed, for THIS is how you stay in control. You have a choice, you idiot, right here, right now, let yourself slip once, and it’s down hill from there my friend, like the Gemini VIII “tumbling end over end”.\nThere is always a moment, a fragment of a space, that gray area that swings between possibilities, the moment when opposing voices swirl in your head, coalescing to a blur like the ochre yellows and blues of Starry Night; it’s the moment wherein lies the choice. You can choose to spit out the food, or you can choose to ignore the echoes in your head, and nourish your body.\nI have been so malnourished, for so long, that my body literally does’t know how to eat naturally anymore. It actually requires a conscious decision and effort to do so.\nI am fighting it every waking moment. I think, it’s like attempting to overcome a drug addiction.\nBecause you can’t stop.\nYou want to WANT to stop, but you are so severely constrained, restrained, chained to the spot by the echoes of this addiction that is Anorexia, that making the right choice is… virtually impossible. When you are in the bottom of that chasm, bridging the gap to WANTING recovery, is like leaping over the San Andreas Fault. It’s like jumping across continents. Wanting to WANT to make the right choice, is the difference between galaxies.\nThe truth of it is, that it is a dilemma everyone encounters, at some point in their lives, to the lesser or greater extent.\nMaybe its deciding to break some insalubrious habits; perhaps it’s biting your nails or skimping on sleep, or a couch potato turning gym rat (cue in New Years resolutions), to something more detrimental such as overcoming a severe, lifelong addiction.\nBut really, what it boils down to is the INABILITY to make a different choice. More precisely, the incapability of WANTING to make the right decision. Although, deep inside, we know what we ought to do.\nSo… No. It’s not a choice.\nNot at the moment, anyway.\nBut I hope, that one day, in the early hours of a morning, walking the damp sward and with the fringes of my pants sopping wet, I will finally be able to reach up, as easy as one, two, three and pick that sour-sweet apple from my Arkansas Black tree.\nCrunch.\n\n[https://medium.com/@nefritelor/no-its-not-a-choice-17d235370dd1](https://medium.com/@nefritelor/no-its-not-a-choice-17d235370dd1)'}, {'Disordered': 'Any tips on how to stop body checking?

We lived separately when we started dating, I was in catered accommodation, he had his own place with a friend.\n\nHe\'s pretty skinny, which is something I\'m kind of insecure about. He doesn\'t know this is something that makes me feel guilty, as it\'s not an issue (definitely not *his* issue), and is not something I want him aware of, or knowing him, feeling bad about. It is simply something I\'m working on regarding my own perception of myself. I\'ve never dated a guy who has thinner thighs than me. I know this sounds dumb, but sometimes when we\'re sat beside each other, and I look down, it makes me feel super insecure. Anyway, thats not the problem. Past my own insecurities about my own body, I really think that everyone else\'s are beautiful.\n\nMy issue is that I used to have an ED. Nothing super severe. I don\'t even know if my issues would be considered an ED. My cousin is the only one I\'ve spoken to about it, and suggested I had one.  I still don\'t feel super comfortable calling it that, and wouldn\'t generally. I just didn\'t know how else to refer to it, or where else to ask.  It\'s been something that started most prominently during my teenage years, and got especially bad during COVID. I always felt proud of myself when skipping meals, or going extended periods of time without eating. I would exercise extensively for days, then get burnt out and stop.\n\nRecently, I\'ve been making steps to overcome this. It gets bad sometimes, especially when I\'m not occupied with things like classes, but generally I\'ve been getting better. I\'ve been actively forcing myself to not feel guilty about eating. I\'ve actively been making myself  eat three meals a day. I still get some serious guilt surrounding snacking, even when I\'m hungry, but like I said, I\'m working on it.\n\nMy friends all eat very healthily, and they are who I had most of my meals with in college. It was actually kind of easy, especially in the dining hall, as portion sizes were given to us (rather than serving yourself), and there were set meal times throughout the day. \n\nThe issue comes with my boyfriends attitude towards food. He barely eats. This was something I kind of noticed when we first started dating. He has nothing against eating (apparently), but thinks as hunger as nothing but a mental thing that you can ignore, and food as barely maintenance. Sometimes he would offhand mention that he hadn\'t had breakfast or lunch that day, and I would ask "are you not hungry?" and he\'d just shrug and say stuff like "nah, I can just ignore hunger". I\'d urge him to eat healthier, and make him promise to have dinner when he got back to his place, but feel guilty for the rest of the day. I\'d often skip meals after we spoke about it, despite myself knowing better. I know that his eating habits should not influence mine, but I hear him say that and I think somehow, like it\'s some kind of competition. Like, he hasn\'t eaten anything all day, but I\'ve had two meals, so better skip dinner to compensate. If he can do it why can\'t I?\n\nI would get super upset by his ability to just ignore hunger, because I couldn\'t. It was something I wanted desperately to be able to do. I would try everything, but just couldn\'t. But he can. He doesn\'t even seem phased. Why couldn\'t I do that?\n\n(Also, I\'ve tried to mention it a few times, subtly, to see if he was struggling somehow, and I might be able to help, but he assured me he has no issue with eating. He just finds it boring and wishes he didn\'t have to do it. He says sometimes he\'ll just eat loads in one go at breakfast so he doesn\'t have to eat for the rest of the day. He says it\'s inconvenient to have to stop what he\'s doing to eat if he gets hungry, so he doesn\'t. He doesn\'t get any enjoyment from it either. He says his attitude towards most flavours are neutral, or negative. There\'s no particular meal that he\'s fond of.)\n\nI think the bigger incident for me came a couple months after we got together, and I went to his place for the weekend once classes ended. It was Saturday, and we decided to go do some tourist-y stuff. Whilst we were out, it got a little past lunch time and I mentioned grabbing lunch. He seemed unfazed by this, and we went to fast food place since it was close by. He was talking enthusiastically to me the whole time, but barely touched his food. He ended up finishing like half, then looked down and said "oh you\'re done? We can head back out if you want", I asked if he was hungry and he basically said "nah, I\'d rather go back out than waste time eating", then we left.\n\nLater that night, we went to his place and watched a movie. I didn\'t have it in me to mention getting snacks. It was past the time I\'d normally eat dinner.  It was already dark, and I\'d only had lunch that day. I was getting really hungry, but I just couldn\'t bring it in me to mention food. The guilt was too strong. About 2 hours later, once the movie was over and we were just talking, I had to mention it, motivated now more by the fact that I didn\'t want my stomach making noises. I still feel guilty about giving in and saying something. He didn\'t have any food in the house, which made sense because he\'d been visiting his parents for like a week and a half before this, and his roommate had gone home for the summer. So I suggested we ordered something. He seemed reluctant. Or maybe I was paranoid. He said he wasn\'t really hungry, so I can just order what I wanted. I couldn\'t. It just had to feel mutual, otherwise I don\'t think I could fight off the guilt. After a while, we ordered something for us both. Two separate meals. Neither of us finished them.\n\nThe next morning we woke up and just hung out for a bit, chatted, watched some youtube, etc. He never mentioned breakfast. We were set to go out around 2/3pm-ish and meet some mutual friends. I was starting to get really hungry. Even as I got ready to go out, I didn\'t have it in me to mention lunch. I snuck a few fries from yesterday\'s leftovers to ensure my stomach wasn\'t making noises when we went out, and still felt bad.\n\nI went back to my own place after we met our friends, even though I was meant to spend another night with him.\n\nWe hung out a few more times before I went home for the summer. I was distant for a while. I didn\'t mean to be, but I just was.  Now, I have a lot of anxiety surrounding going back next semester, and one of the issues I keep thinking about is the guilt I feel eating around him. It\'s not his fault, I know that, it\'s my own issues that are getting in the way, but knowing that doesn\'t make it any easier.\n\nI\'ve had a kinda bad summer with it, counting calories and stuff, but nothing too bad. I\'m just worried that being back there will make me bad again. I won\'t have a dining hall either this year. I\'m cooking for myself.\n\nI know there\'s not really a clear question that I\'m asking here, I just don\'t know what to do. I really like him, a lot, and he\'s not doing anything wrong. I\'m the problem. I need to be stronger. But it\'s just so hard. Surely, what\'s he\'s doing isn\'t healthy either? But when he explains himself so confidently, I can\'t help feeling like I\'m failing somehow, and I\'m weak for not being able to do the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf this isn\'t the right place for this kind of post, just let me know. I\'ve never used reddit before, and didn\'t know who else to ask about this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome side information:\n\nI haven\'t really spoken to anyone about my relationship, besides a cousin of mine who I\'m pretty close with and has similar struggles. But this never went beyond guilty confessions and an agreement that it was unhealthy. Family and friends are aware of how little I eat and I think my sister knows I have some guilt surrounding eating, but I\'ve never mentioned this specific issue to anyone.\n\nAlso, my ex often hinted at me being fat. I\'m average weight for my height, I know this logically, but a lot of his influence still impacts my mental process.  I won\'t mention specific quotes, since I don\'t really want anyone finding this, but they\'re hard to describe. All subtle and yet super obvious comments on my size, especially how clothes looked on me.'}, {'Recovery': "I'm back in therapy finally and excited to delve into my eating disorder with her  I know it's weird to say you're excited to go to therapy, or even that you *want* to talk about your ED... but mine has been getting worse and worse while the rest of my life seems to be getting better/more stable.

I work from home, so I’m *completely* alone most of the time, which also makes it hard to like, just eat when other people are eating as a social thing.

I'm a pastry chef in SoCal, and as much as I freaking love it, love baking, love creating, every day is such a struggle. I didn't realize how bad my food addiction was until about a year or so ago.

Now that I'm baking professionally, I've been trying to keep eating sweets to a minimum (and outside of work I eat super healthy), but when my job requires me to eat sweets, it is so so hard to stop after one bite. And I'm at a point where I dont even have that first bite, but i can't do that with my work. I have barely any trigger foods at home that don't bother me too much, and I have a strict meal plan that I follow religiously, but being at work stresses me out every day. I tried having a rubber band on my wrist and snap it every time I had a craving, or just writing NO on my arm in sharpie to remind myself not to eat. But when I have to take that first bite then it all goes out of the window. I also try to chew and then spit it out so I dont swallow it which works only to a certain extent. I'm so lost and I don't want every day at work to feel like such a struggle to get through, and I wonder if maybe a change in career would benefit me. It doesn't have to be a permanent career change, maybe just for a year or a few months. I don't know. If you've gone through something similar, I'd love to hear your story.

Basically I got beat down by my binge eating & wt loss attempts. I started as a child to use food for comfort, boredom, entertainment, lonliness and any other reason. I started dieting at age 12.\xa0 I tried the things most people try. I\'d have success and wt loss. Get patted on the back and feel good, but it wouldn\'t last. Why? Hadn\'t i arrived? Hadn\'t i achieved what i worked so hard for. For reasons i didn\'t understand and put much time into therapy trying to unpack i would go back to compulsive eating. It would get worse overtime. I would go to exremes with food/eating/wt. At times i was morbidly obese, other times i looked like a fitness insructor.\xa0 To compensate for my eating I would compulsively exercise, throw off my hormone balance and gave myself a hernia. I cut out all carbs at one point and then started to compulsively eat salad. I worked in a career where i needed to model good health - why couldn\'t i do it for good and all? \n\n\xa0With all this I came to realize I was screwed between the ears when it came to managing food/wt/eating. I tried all the options normal eaters try. I\'d have temporary success. Eventually I\'d go back to compulsive eating (eating outside of nourishment). I was baffled. Why did the things that worked for normal eaters not work for me? I learned in the 12 step program that I have an actual illness of the mind and body, but it centers in my mind. My mind will always take me back to compulsive eating as a solution because i am just wired that way. At rest my spirit is disturbed and it\'s only a matter of time before i compulsively eat. That is why i keep going back to it even when i swear off and have every reason to stop. I could stop compulsively eating, but i could not STAY stopped. Also, I could not stop myself in the middle of a binge - I\'d lose control and go on a spree eating way more than intended. I wondered if i was doomed? It sure felt that way. \n\nThen i came to OA. I got on a meeting & listened. Later spoke with a sponsor, heard her story and it resononated with me. I asked her to sponsor me. The vital actions i took were getting a sponsor (someone already recovered who could guide me through the steps and help me see things my sick unrecovered mind could not see) AND work the 12 steps quickly out of the big book of AA, adapted for compulsive eating to get recovered. OA was definitely the last house on the block for me and it needed to be. How else would i know how powerless I am.\xa0 I had to hit rock bottom with my compulsive eating before I\'d have the willingness, open-mindedness and humility to say i can\'t do this on my own. My logic &\xa0 willpower can\'t fix this! I needed help and became willing to do anything to recover.\xa0 My behavior was leading me to a life full of health problems and an early death if i stayed on that path.\xa0 Today, miraculously I CAN eat for nourishment.\xa0 I no longer turn to food to "fix" the way i feel or "to deal" with life stressors or situations i feel I have no control. I am free. I am grateful to have the 12 step program and work the steps because life is so much now. I\'m a saner, happier person.

I am having an issue that I feel like this community may have experience with and could offer some advice.\n\nI am having a hard time picking something to eat or making myself eat something that is not the food I am craving. Many days, I really really crave fast food, but I want to limit my intake due to health concerns. Diabetes runs rampant in my family and the older I get, the more concerned I am with the direction my health could go if I don't start eating foods more suited for diabetic or pre-diabetic people. Also, eating fast food all the time is expensive and I'm trying to save money. (I mean, look at this economy, amirite?) Additionally, I've realized that I've internalized some judgement now that my significant other and I are living together and they have never been one to eat fast food a lot. They are smaller and I am a big person. They've never judged me for my body size or commented negatively on what I eat, but I accidentally created a dialog in my head about it anyway. \n\nThe problem is, if I can't eat what I'm craving, picking something else feels impossible. I feel frustrated and angry and sad that I'm not eating the thing I want to be eating. I want to cry. My partner tries to help by suggesting things I could make, but that honestly makes me even more frustrated and want to cry more. I SEE everything that I can make. I already have gone over every possible thing I could make in the house and none of them are going to replace what I really want to eat.\n\nOn top of this, whenever my partner leaves to visit parents or hike or something, I always immediately go out and get fast food. And then I freaking HIDE the evidence like I committed a CRIME or something.\n\nOn top of ALL of that, I have huge anxiety with cooking. So trying to foods, new recipes, etc is so stressful for me. I look at a recipe and I want to break down in tears. My mother never taught me how to cook so as an adult on my own, I've always ordered in or just ate chicken nuggets. I feel so inadequate compared to my partner whose family has always cooked meals at home.\n\nI'm so lost. I've tried explaining some of this to my therapist but I don't think she understands or is qualified to offer coaching (on eating disorders??? That's what I'm starting to feel like this is becoming).\n\nIs there anyone who has been through something similar? What helped you?

I don\'t know what to think about this..\n\n(Trigger warning: this post contains talk about weight, no numbers are mentioned, body image, mentions of behaviors such as calories counting, purging, excessive exercising, binging. Stay safe!)\n\nHi! I\'m Lillith, just to put down some context, I\'m a minor, undiagnosed, and while I can\'t officially say that I have an ED, it\'s pretty obvious that I do. My ED kinda consists of what I call "phases" I have a phase where I\'m full on counting calories, skipping meals, liquid cals at best, smoking to cut hunger, drinking a lot, exercising. Then the other is binging. It doesn\'t stsy long (a week or so) and doesn\'t happen often, it\'s triggered when I don\'t get food I\'m body for a long time and start watching mukbangs and stuff about food, I then feel guilty and gross and go back to the other phase. Sometimes when I have no choice I eat like a "normal person" but try to burn it off by exercising (I do at home biking and sometimes sit-ups). What triggers me, weirdly, are compliments. I had gained a lot during the summer bc I did nothing but stay in my room and would snake a lot, I shed the pounds naturally when I got back to school because I would have sports classes, would walk around the school everyday and couldn\'t snake at school. (TW: Numbers/talk about my weight) So I went from an average weight in August, to a low-average weight in November. Then I started getting a lot of compliments from a lil group of younger girls at my school (my friends called them my fangirls) they would say I was pretty and all, then sometimes they would hug me and say, wow you\'re so thin! That\'s so cool! \nI crave compliments, affection, I want to keep it forever, I have a past with bullying and parents I disappointed cuz I wasn\'t diagnosed with ADHD until 8th grade (so really). I would rarely get compliments, so now I do everything to keep them. While I was someone who didn\'t want to care about they way I looked because I knew I was too mentally unstable for it lol, this triggered something in me. My mom also made comments me she saw me eating snack "be careful you\'re going to end up like this summer"\nI slowly started to get obsessed with my weight, and a goal of being underweight made its way into my head. So here was the starting point of my ED. Now I\'m kinda deep into it but it\'s summer break so skipping meals is hard, I try to exercise, I skipped meals when my parents worked, now they don\'t so I can\'t. But I also got into the binging phase until 2 days ago. \nHere\'s the thing, I don\'t like throwing up, but that didn\'t stop me from trying to make myself purge, I\'ve never been able to though. Until today, I was trying to purge but couldn\'t, I went on internet, searched "how to make yourself puke" found something, tried it once, succeeded. I did about three times until I just couldn\'t bc I still don\'t like to throw up. I exercised a lot today, purged, and skipped to meals, and drank a lot of water. I felt the dizziness I feel when "it\'s working" I\'m used to it and it\'s strangely satisfying since I associate it with weight loss. The purging too, while I still don\'t like to puke, I had this feeling of satisfaction. \n\nNow, I don\'t know what to think about this... did I just achieved a new, dangerous, step into my ED? Or is it just me being dramatic about it, and I probably won\'t pick up on this behavior?

I’ve been at my current program for a month and a half and have made some really good progress, but I’ve also somewhat plateaued and am still engaging in a range of ED behaviors. My treatment team is recommending I spend a couple weeks at a HLOC as sort of a tune up/jump start as they feel discharging me with my current frequency using certain behaviors could be very risky. I am a student, and they’re concerned that without extra intervention I’ll backslide at the start of the school year.  \n\nMe and my outpatient team were all somewhat surprised by this suggestion as I have generally been eating adequate amounts each day even with some restriction/compulsive exercise (for example, might restrict at a meal but overall intake for the day is good, or might make ED driven food choices but they still minimally meet my meal plan, or do some compulsive exercise but at low frequency/intensity). My outpatient team basically said this would be a somewhat unusual step up in treatment bc it wouldn’t be the result of me doing super badly in IOP but instead a sort of safeguard/method to get me doing even better and get out of this “stuck” zone. IOP team confirmed that I’m very compliant and engaged and that a some things are going well, they just see areas I’m still struggling and that they think would be good to improve. My OP team definitely hasn’t discouraged me from trying a HLOC but agreed with me that it might not be necessary and that this is ultimately my choice based on what I think will help me and whether I’m willing to engage with the process. I’m not opposed to trying a HLOC for a short period because I really truly want to recover, but I’m also concerned being at a HLOC will surround me with people who are much sicker in a way that will be really distressing or something.

If so, how did you respond?

My mother, who I lived with at the time, was completely freaking out and made me watch slideshows looking at people dying of anorexia to force me to eat more.

Over the course of the past 4 months, I have gained weight due to stress eating, making me now overweight. During that time, I started binging and purging.

I've managed to hide this from my family, but I can't keep living like this. I need to get a healthy relationship with food and get down to a healthy weight without being hospitalized. I am so scared and I don't know what to do. Should I see a family doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist?

If they do, i can only take a few bites before im finished. i feel like my health is in bad shape because of this. I wake up feeling starving to the point i feel like puking or fainting. I talked to my therapist about it and she doesnt think its an ED because it has nothing to do with the way that i look, it was a survival tactic.

My bulimia wasn’t that serious when I first started, but it’s been getting worst, especially this past 6 months. \n\nDue to Covid lockdowns and work stress, my appetite started to get reaaaaalllly small around this time last year, and I was at my skinniest. \n\nBeginning of this year, a lot of my friends were moving out of the country, so I started to go out to eat with them more and do a lot more farewell lunches/dinners. Long story short, I gained weight. \n\nIt definitely sucks to see myself go from my skinniest, to the state that I am now.

I set a limit on calorie intake (I'm not including a specific number, but it's around the lower bound of recommended intake for an adult woman). At first, I could manage the diet with willpower, but things soon went downhill. I started to have binging episodes once a week. There’s a vending machine at my university dorm, and around 2-3AM I would go there and buy candy and chips. Feeling guilty, I tried to eat very little the next day.\n\nDuring winter break, I ate almost the same food items for breakfast and then nothing else for the rest of the day. When school resumed, I tried maintaining my calorie restriction, but matters became worse. The foods I ate increasingly consisted of sweet, processed foods with clear calorie labels on them.\n\nTowards the end of march, I decided to end my terrible ‘dieting’ practices. I began eating as much as I wanted. But I soon noticed that I almost never felt full. No matter how much I ate for every meal and snack, I wanted to eat more. My constant hunger intensified in May, and ever since I would eat as much as two or three meals’ worth of food for each meal.\n\nI’m writing because I’m concerned about my health; I eat so much that I continue to rapidly gain weight, and I’m worried this will eventually lead to obesity.

At the start of the pandemic, something happened that never happened before-I started getting disgusted at the idea of food and just avoided it as much as I could but still ate when pushed. However it was honestly not something I wanted to do. It was the idea of chewing food, for some reason, that almost made me angry. I was under a  lot of stress then because of the pandemic and I was worried about courses in university to the extent where I felt like my life was being stolen from me (obviously other issues were there). Basically, it was an exceptional situation. However, I have noticed that since then (2 years back) I have developed a habit of periodically not knowing what to eat and feeling ashamed about it because no food excites me or I just don't want to eat at all. I eat so I don't get hunger pangs. \n\nStrange thing is, previously, whenever I got nervous, I overate because food comforted me. I loved and still love food. In fact, in the past, I ate so much I felt sick at times and there were even times when I vomited (also unhealthy, I know. I guess I've had a shit relationship with food for a while now). I never caused a fuss about food and for decades ate the same thing without complaint, but now at 24 I have moments where I feel irritated at food overall. I feel embarrassed because this feels like such a petty issue to have. Thankfully it hasn't been as severe as the first episode when I ended up losing 8 kgs within 2 months (only noticed when other people told me I looked much thinner because I was just not in the right state of mind). \n\nAnyway, when I recovered, I started intermittent fasting as part of a strict routine that included language learning, bullet journaling, exercising, etc to whip myself out of a funk and dropped 7 more kgs over 5-6 months. All was fine. My parents were always stick thin and still are so I was the odd one out cause my sister is super thin too. I wasn't too bothered by it because I was in a very competitive school and there were far too many things already giving me pressure. I used to be over 10kgs overweight and am now at a weight considered healthy (65kg, 5ft 5 inch). Obviously like many girls my age I wanted to be thin very badly when I was young but with many other kinds of pressures I kind of forgot about it and I was never the kind of girl who was able to starve myself. \n\nNow however, I suddenly get mad at food or having to eat cause it feels like such an insurmountable task, I don't know why. **What I noticed is, this happens every time I'm stressed. It's like I take the rage out on food and eating just feels like another task that must be completed or else.**\n\nOther info-I was suicidal twice within a span of 4 years and I have recovered both times quite well though the experience was excruciating. I also have a bit of an issue with anxiety and sometimes anger. But if I may say so myself, I'm pretty strong and am a fighter. Just worried about my sudden disgust of food that pops up at times because I will be living alone soon and know it isn't healthy. Asking for advice here cause I live in a developing country where some therapists literally tell you to pray your problems away and even if you find a good one, there is heavy social stigma. Also I think most aren't trained for this kind of thing. Advice and tips would be highly appreciated. Thank you."}, {'Disordered': "How to help my body?  Recovering from b/p anorexia.

I am in an incredible dilemma at the moment. I just graduated college in May, and I've been interviewing for jobs over the summer. I just got a phone call today with an incredible job offer that I would normally be so thrilled about (I still am so excited by the prospect of it), would be a great start to my career, and is for a cause I really care about. Notably, though, it will be a fast-paced, time-consuming position, and I would be moving away from my family and friends to take it.\n\nI've also been struggling with a relapse into my anorexia for about 2 years now. I was on the path back to recovery for a while last year, and then backslid this spring and have been slowly declining again, and my doctor and therapist are recommending I seek residential treatment -- in fact, I'm on a waitlist and would probably get admitted in the next couple of weeks. I just heard from my doctor today that my bloodwork came back with alarmingly low glucose, along with some other concerning results. I don't feel the symptoms of any of this -- I never experience low blood sugar symptoms, apparently because my body has adjusted to it. I know I've lost weight but it's not in a dire place -- I don't need to be hospitalized or anything like that. I'm getting by, and still eating every meal/snack, just probably too little of them. I'm not crashing and burning or anything like that.\n\nSo I'm at a really terrible crossroads here: option 1 is to accept the job offer and do what I need to do through outpatient treatment, get a dietician and a meal plan and try to keep myself stable (and ideally on an upward path) as I work this job. Fortunately, my doctor is actually located in the city I would be moving to, so I would actually be closer to him and excellent dietician options. Option 2 is to turn down my first, pretty-much-perfect job offer of adulthood and commit to going to residential whenever a spot opens up, and then explore other options once I get out and am more stable.\n\nThis is hell to try to figure out, and I have two days to think about it.

I always wanted to be thicker. \n\nI had gone through a lot in my childhood, and especially my early young adult years.

Now when ever I get stressed or overwhelmed it triggers these restricting periods as a sort of coping mechanism.

It’s time I try and take control of this.  Currently, I\'m a 30 year old male, and weigh just about what would be considered healthy for my height. Around 10 years ago, I was much more overweight and miserable. I felt sluggish, self-conscious, and had no confidence. After working hard to get "in shape", I lost the weight and have "kept it off" for lack of a better term ever since. I run daily (3-5 miles; longer on the weekends) and have previously done consistent weight lifting routines. Life has caught up with me and I\'ve fallen off the weight lifting train, but still keep up a regular cardio routine (runs in the morning, lots of walking with my 2 year old border collie!).

I have a pretty good idea of what my maintenance calories.\n\nThat said...I feel that I have developed an eating disorder over the last two years or so. Food is never just "food" to me anymore.

I find myself pre-planning meals, especially if I am going to go out with friends, or get reservations at a restaurant I\'ve been dying to try. That way, I can plan the calories I\'ll be intaking and make sure I stay at or under my maintenance. I\'ve also started to skip meals...mainly lunch, when I can. I\'ll have a Quest protein bar, or some carrots, or some other "lower calories" snacks to tide me over...drink lots and lots of water and sparkling water to keep me "full". And then I\'ll eat a normal dinner...of course, more often than not, this has resulted in me having an awful binge night.

I don\'t know how to view food as "food", how to not feel guilty for eating when I\'m hungry, or for enjoying a cookie or some ice cream or a beer/cocktail with friends.

Her password was surprisingly easy to guess so I ended up looking through a couple apps and found some worrying content (crazy diets and inspo pictures on Pinterest). I feel like this in some way has to be my fault. I’ve never been formally diagnosed, in fact, I’ve never even told my parents about my eating issues or had them ask about it. This past year I’ve been genuinely recovering on my own. I don’t restrict anymore and I feel much better mentally. I feel like I should and have to tell my parents (which i will), but in some fucked up way i’m worried that this will all crash down on me. That she might  say something along the lines of “it’s her fault and that she’s where I got my ideas from,” ultimately causing my parents to worry and stress about me when I am seriously better. \n\nEither way, I care about my sister and I will tell them. If anyone has any similar experiences or how I should go about this please tell me. Kinda stressed lol'}, {'Disordered': 'more obsessive?

Hi there. So I\'m (28F) just looking for some advice I guess regarding my husband (30M) and his body image issues. He suffers very much with his perception of himself to the point that I am sometimes concerned and honestly I\'m reaching a point where I am burned out and exasperated with talking about it. I try to be understanding and reassuring to him. He has a very abusive father who he is permanently NC with now for over a year. His father spent basically his whole childhood berating DH for his weight. He was a chubby kid and loved food, but they did nothing to help him. They filled the house with junk food and soda and then berated him, a young child, for taking it. My heart bleeds for him when he tells me the things his father would say to him about his weight (just straight up bullying) and the things he would do to shame him for it.\n\nWhen he was a teenager, he started losing weight because of something his father said to him that was so hurtful that he says his mind blocked it out and he can\'t remember exactly what it was. His weight has fluctuated a bit over the years but he\'s always been a fairly normal, healthy weight. When we met, he was very fit as he was working out a lot and doing keto.\n\nHe\'s gained a bit since then, but still looks great; just a little extra. I\'m a little chubby myself so I don\'t care at all. I\'m bigger than him, I feel. He, however, is distraught about it all the time. He\'s tried doing keto again multiple times, but always falls off the wagon because it\'s honestly just not that doable anymore for him; it impacts our social life and our ability to go out and do fun things together.\n\nI\'ve urged him to instead focus on a balanced diet and he agrees, but any time he lets himself have one thing that\'s not diet-friendly, he obsesses over it for days after. He stares at himself in the mirror and grabs at his stomach, turns to the side and sucks in until he looks concave, etc. It worries me a lot. If I wasn\'t with him almost all the time, I would really worry about him skipping meals.\n\nMy issue now is that I cannot keep reassuring him multiple times a day. It\'s starting to negatively affect my own self image and I\'m starting to obsess too. I can\'t handle him saying "I\'m so fat" and telling him "You look fine, I like how you look" twenty times a day. Sometimes he even gets annoyed with me for disagreeing, so I don\'t know what to say. He sees a therapist for other things, and I have been begging him for ages to talk to her honestly about the body image issues, which he acknowledges are a problem, but he won\'t do it. He thinks if he accepts himself how he is, he won\'t care about how he looks and he\'ll get fat, and I don\'t know how to explain to him that that\'s not how that works.\n\nI\'m really at the end of my rope with the endless conversations about his weight but I don\'t know how to say this to him. I\'m so frustrated and sometimes I feel he can tell how tired I am of the conversation. I don\'t want to hurt him or make him feel like I\'m not there for him, but there\'s nothing more I feel I can do and it\'s really starting to get into my head and I\'m feeling bad about my own body. I don\'t know what to do. Any advice?'}, {'Disordered': 'Is it considered an eating disorder to spit out bad food out after chewing and savoring the flavor?  I recently started gaining weight out of no where. For most of my life (I\'m 22 now) I\'ve been able to eat whatever I want without gaining any weight like the rest of my family. I\'m constantly moving my body so I\'m always burning calories. I haven\'t asked a doctor yet what\'s going on with my body, but I\'ve been trying to cut back on junk food so I can lose at least 10 pounds. I\'m buying and preparing more healthier dishes and watching YouTube videos of women suggesting the types of whole foods and meals I should eat. It\'s a huge struggle because my tongue is so used to eating sweets and junk that I\'m not enjoying this new diet. Obviously I\'m going to continue this diet so my body is healthy and I\'m maintaing a normal body weight. But I really want to eat junk and sweets again as well.\n\nI thought long and hard about this. At first I said, "Okay, let\'s eat some junk and then work out extra harder." But that sounds like a lot work. So then I asked myself, "Why do you like junk so much?" The flavor. The taste. Sometimes the texture and smell. So then I thought to myself, "If the only reason you like eating junk is for the taste (duh), then why not just chew the food and spit it out? That way, all that bad processed food won\'t make your body unhealthy, fatigue, etc.". So I took a bite of fried chicken, chewed it, enjoyed the flavor and spit it out. Then I took a sip of water to get the aftertaste out of my mouth. I stood there and questioned whether this means I have an eating disorder. A big part of me feels there is nothing wrong with spitting out bad food. (I mean, IT\'S BAD. We\'re technically not to supposed to consume processed food like KFC). A small part of me worries that this method will be a waste of money. But maybe it won\'t be. If I really think about it, it\'s no different than if the food came out while going no. 2. Instead it\'s coming out by my mouth (*not \'*throwing up\' cause stomach acid will mess up the throat and cause an alser. No thank you). The only difference between the food I will swallow and the food I won\'t swallow is, one is healthy enough for my body to absorb while the other isn\'t. \n\nSo my question is, is this method harmful? Is it fine but weird? Would it be considered an eating disorder? Should I just cut junk food out of my life completely?'}, {'Disordered': 'I am relapsing. And I don’t know how to stop.

Just found this sub and figured I’d post once a day to share my experiences going from orthorexia to anorexia to bulimia to anorexia to BED, i still struggle daily with the little things but I’d like to say my mindset is almost fully recovered. (Despite intrusive thoughts and a disordered environment) \n\nI’ll start today off with an experience of mine that is shared by many, how I began recovering from it, and how I continue to recover from it. Eating disorders are processes that take time, there is no quick fix, and that’s the reality.\n\nOne thing a lot of us with eating disorders seem to relate to is our relationship with food as children. Whether our parents were super health obsessed or the complete opposite, most times that ends up with children with complications relationships with food. In my case, my mother was a huge advocate for weight watchers and, growing up, most of my childhood snacks were weight watchers brand. (Despite being a very athletic and healthy kid). This, of course, took a toll on me when I discovered that other kids my age were not being fed these things, so any time I came across normal food, I would destroy that shit. It still affects me today, since I am a minor living with this same parent who STILL obsesses over her food intake and how much sugar or fat we are all eating as a family, despite pretty much all of her kids developing extreme forms of disordered eating. One of my many extremes was when I went keto at the ripe age of ELEVEN. I am seventeen now, and though I am a huge advocate for weightlifting, I no longer obsess over my food intake in any form. After going through the many eating disorders for roughly six years, someone asked me why I was weighing my food at a family reunion, and I told them why. That is when it clicked how ridiculous my eating habits were. That was my first step to recovery, discussing my disordered habits *out loud.*\n\nI find that discussing your traumas with professionals helps you to understand that, though these tendencies are pretty insane, it’s not your fault and you are very much not alone. That is why I am posting on this sub today, because I know a lot of us on here don’t have access to professionals like others. So please, use the comments of this post to talk about your habits, if you may find that to be, in any way, of comfort or help.

It started with what we originally thought was gastritis and her complaining of stomach pains. As clues started coming together, her doctors began to realize that she was intentionally starving herself. As of now she is severely underweight and her doctors have said that she has little to no visceral fat surrounding her organs and her intestines are becoming necrotic. Her parents feel absolute shame for letting her get this far in the disease and are desperate for help.\n\nMy fiance's family lives in western Europe while we are in the US, adding to our own sense of helplessness. Their country is known for very blunt medical care, so after the doctors developed suspicion, they and the hospital staff immediately began accusing my sister-in-law of the disorder and treating her like a criminal/selfish for having one while admitting her, which I believe pushed her deeper into the pro-ana community. She's since deleted any of her whole-body instagram pictures, body-checks herself in the mirror constantly, purposely got a job at a brewery where she works 14 hour shifts at a time to have an excuse not to eat, always saying she's tired and going to her room without dinner, etc.\n\nWe honestly don't know what to do as we have been getting conflicting advice, and we are desperate for answers. One of her primary doctors told her father that he's afraid to admit her to an ED rehab center as she'll be with many girls in the pro-ana community that could potentially positively feedback on her ED. However, she's also going to turn 18 in a year and have complete medical autonomy, so they are running out of time to admit her to anything involuntarily.\n\nPlease tell me any stories, anecdotes, or advice on what to do next.

Last October, after becoming overweight over lockdown due to mental health issues, I began trying to lose some weight. Most of my motivation to lose the weight came from persistent comments from my family and such; I was happy with my body. It wasn\'t really something I thought about. I don\'t know thought. One day I just snapped. I ended up losing a good amount, and once I hit my goal weight (pre-lockdown weight), I wasn\'t happy; I had to keep going. I\'ve stayed mostly healthy in my methods, and haven\'t really gone past a safe deficit. However, I know my mindset isn\'t a healthy one. I\'m obsessive in counting every calorie, exercising, and weighing. My weight-loss hasn\'t been drastic, and im still in a \'healthy\' BMI now, which has made it easy to hide from my parents. \n\nHowever in the past few months, I\'ve started seeing an endocrinologist who im seeing once every three months. Today was my second visit, and my doctor expressed concern with it, saying that if this trend has continued by my next visit to her in three months she\'ll consider referring me to a nutritionist. This means that my weight loss is no longer something I can hide behind, which terrifies me. I\'m not happy with my body yet, but I have no other choice but to try and recover. I don\'t want to but there\'s not really another choice. I\'m worried if I\'m referred to a nutritionist I\'ll be forced to stop being vegan (my whole family is vegan for ethical reasons), or something so I would really love to avoid having to go to one. I\'m so worried and I don\'t want to stop losing but I need to recover. \n\nDo any of you guys have advice for self recovery and getting out of the "not sick enough" mindset and pursuing recovery?

I myself am recovering from an ED that I struggled with for almost a decade. I feel I have gotten very far in my recovery. \n\nA couple years ago, I started a relationship with my current boyfriend. He was skinny. He did eat a lot (and mostly fast food), but because of financial reasons, food was not always available. I think he managed to eat a lot at times and not gain weight, simply because he sometimes had to skip meals because he had no money for food. Since we have been living together, there is always food available, because my financial situation is quite good. He now has access to a filled pantry, fridge, freezer, snacks and regular meals. He also works from home now, instead of cycling to different locations each day. Over the last years, he has gained weight (he still has a healthy weight) that he now wants to lose. I don't object to this. \n\nHowever, he really hates his body now. He doesn't even want to be intimate any more because of his looks. He tells me he considers taking medication for adhd because it makes him lose his appetite. He doesn't have adhd though. He says things like only drinkint vinegar for a day, or vomiting after every meal, or eating rotten food or throwing out perfectly fine food. I recognise all of this. When I was deep in my ED, I had all these thoughts over and over again. I took pills, threw away food.... I understand him. The point is that he says I dont understand him and that nobody understands him. \n\nRecently, he became more hostile to me. Suddenly I and my family are the reason that he is gaining weight and we are his enemy. I cook him food, because that's how we decided to divide chores between us. During the years that we are together, I have been able to maintain the same weight. \n\nLast week we went to a family get together. There were fries, but it was a buffet style meal so no one was forced to eat something they didn't like. He ate fries, a lot of fries. When we got home, he suddenly started blaming my family and I that he ate fries. He said that I didn't support him, that I let him eat fries even when I knew he didn't want to. Personally, that fact that he ate fries wasnt even on my mind. And I definitely wasnt going to tell him what he could and could not eat in public, in front of my family. I think that is humiliating, and I wouldnt want to humiliate him in front of my family. \n\nHe now says that's just an excuse I made up. He says that I should police his food if I care about him and our relationship. While I feel that a middle age can assemble a meal from a buffet and make the decisions he wants to make. \n\nI dont want to be the food police, because I know how much that hurt me in the past. I dont want to push an extreme diet on him, because I know it does not work in the long term. I dont want to support his disorder behaviour because I know how damaging it is and how hard it is to recover. I understands he doesn't like the weight gain, but I want to help him in a healty way. \n\nWhereas he thinks I dont support him, if I dont hate his body as much as he does or if I dont force a restrictive food intake upon him. Thruth is, I love his body! He even threatened to leave me for this. Which seems so silly to me, because we worked out way bigger issues in the past (money, kids, family, religious and cultural differences). I love him so so much and I dont want this to break us up, but I am desperate because I am getting a lot of hate from him now too.\n\nDoes anybody know what I can do to help him?

I’m seeking for help and advice on Reddit as a very close friend of mine seems to be suffering from an eating disorder and it worries me a lot.\nSo I’ve known her since she was 11 yo and back then she had a super healthy relationship with food and a healthy weight. Fast forward to when she turned 16 - she started having digestive complications and extremely painful cramps when she ate fibrous foods. She went to the ER and she did many tests (IBS, Crohn, etc but they were all negative). So she reduced her intake of fibrous foods but still ate a little bit of everything, she didn’t lose weight. However, 6 years ago she met this gym addict guy and started going to the gym regularly. I didn’t see her much at that time because we studied in different countries and when I saw her a year later I was stoked - she lost so much weight I almost didn’t recognise her. \nWe were going out for dinner but she didn’t drink anything, and ate barely nothing because all the foods offered ‘were too painful to digest’. Apparently she had extremely painful cramps every time she ate something she couldn’t digest, and this involves what seems to be 99% of the food: pretty much every fruit, veggies, cereals, meat, fish, dairies, etc. But she still didn’t get diagnosed a digestive disorder.\nNow since that time we met I’ve seen her every 3 months: the strain she puts on her body is insane. I told me she last had her period 3 years ago - she’s obviously really underweight, but she goes to the gym every day for 2 to 4 hours despite her body being so fragile. I really thought she was genuine about the intestinal cramps so I started helping her map the foods she could actually eat and she saw a dietician which was not helpful at all - they weighed her and said she was on the ‘upper limit of healthy fat percentage for women’. Like wtf she’s only bones and muscles, but she now told me for the first time that ‘she didn’t see herself weighing more, where would more weight go she would look so bloated’. She let a few sentences like this slip by accident in our conversations when we traveled - ‘I really enjoy wearing XXXS clothing’ - ‘yoghurt doesn’t hurt my stomach but it makes me gain weight like crazy I can’t have too much of it’ or ‘we didn’t walk much this weekend i’ll have to workout to make up for it when I get back home. \nNow i’m pretty sure she has an Ed - but which one? And also how could I help her? I’m the only one she talks to about her eating issues because she says i’m the only one who understands. I don’t think she realises she’s suffering from something more than a purely digestive issue. She also would never go to see a psychiatrist - we come from village where people still believe only crazy persons consult them. She lives with her mom which is extremely toxic and controlling and just bullies her into eating more saying things like ‘you’re so skinny you’re gonna break’ ‘just stop complaining and eat already’ etc \n\nSo… how do I help her and get her to realise she needs support for her mental health without breaking our trust and friendship?'}, {'Disordered': 'Dating and eating disorders.

Literally in the past hour she has eaten a popsicle, huge handful of potatoe chips, and mini brownies with buttercream frosting on top.

My dad does the same trying to make her realize the amount of sugars, fat, and sodium is in the snacks she consumes. Since forever he has also tried to help her workout in a enjoyable way. I do the same as well but she does it for a week or so then gives up. I have been trying to get her back into working out using boxing on the Nintendo switch, but again she refuses. I have no idea what to do anymore. I'm worried about her health, especially in the future and how it'll be harder to reverse back what's been done. I would suspect her issue is actually binge eating disorder. Another thing I noticed is how she has this hatred for skinny/slim women. She randomly starts talking down on them whenever she notices one. I'm actually on the skinny side and it hurts me when she says those things since I already have insecurities about my body being that I'm very skinny and flat. She comments on my body saying im too skinny and I need to eat more. She tells my dad to stop working out as much as he does and to stop eating so healthy. So, I would say she's also suffering with insecurities too. By the way, my dad and I never comments on her body. Him and I only suggests she workout and eat healthier. Well, should I talk to my dad about getting my mom a therapist for her eating disorder? I'm starting to get really worried about her health.

Today I woke up feeling absolutely gutted, so I decided to make an account and write this post in hopes of getting some kind of help and guidance. I don\'t have anyone in my life to talk to that understands what I\'m going through.\n\nFor some background, I\'m a 23 year old female. Growing up, I never thought about weight. While in high school, I was naturally on the thinner side. I didn\'t have any eating struggles, I was just a taller kid with a quick metabolism and my parents always fed me healthy and nutritious home cooked meals. I didn\'t eat much at a time, but I ate super often. My parents would get mad at me when we went out because I would never finish my food.\n\nI think it was after I graduated from high school that I became a full on foodie. I started really loving and appreciating food, would love to eat out with friends, try new places, etc. I started never leaving a plate empty.\n\nI am still in my weight range, not over, and to most people look a perfectly normal weight. However, after a few years of really loving food (especially sweets and junk food), I dont know how, but one day it just hit me that I didnt look like I did before. Like when I was younger and could wear low waist jeans without even realizing that they were low waist. My stomach wasnt flat anymore. When I gain weight, it goes straight into a tummy pouch, and to my face (especially chin area).\n\nI decided to make a change, and started making sure I never ate after 7 PM, because I used to be a night eater. I started losing weight pretty fast. I wasn\'t restricting; in fact, sometimes I would eat as much as possible at 6:50 just to ensure I wouldn\'t be hungry at night. I still lost weight. I was super happy with how I was looking.\n\nBut, after a certain point, the weight loss stopped. But something in me changed... and that wasn\'t good enough. I somehow became obsessed with losing weight. Thats when I started restricting myself. I would have a schedule. A Starbucks iced coffee at 2 PM, should hold me until 6 PM, when I would then have a really tiny meal (even using measuring tools to be able to count the calories in the olive oil used to grease the pan) to make sure my calorie intake for the day was extremely low. I was able to do this for a while, and I would lose weight every single day. I became the weight I wanted and I was somewhat happy with how I looked. But after I reached that weight, I was able to maintain the lifestyle for a while at first... but then it started getting really hard.\n\nI ended up getting into a restrict/ binge cycle. I would have the extremely low number of calories for a few days, and then I would end up being so so hungry, that I would transition into a full blown binge. I couldn\'t take the hunger anymore and would eat everything in sight. Instead of just eating to a point where I got full, I would eat until I was super stuffed and felt sick. While I was restricting I would make lists while super hungry at night, to fantasize about what I could eat on a cheat day. During a binge I would want to give myself everything I ever wanted on that list, in hopes that I would get over the craving and do better tomorrow. My body was so hungry that I wanted everything, and I was in an all or nothing mindset; I already ruined everything so might as well get the most food out of it. The next day I would be so upset that I binged, that I would restrict to make up for it. Then I would get super hungry from restricting, and then binge again. The cycle never stopped.\n\nI would be laying in bed in so much pain. I remember only having fruit one day and then waking up in the middle of the night sweating, crying, feeling extremely dizzy and faint, having intense stomach pain and feeling very nauseous. I was in so much pain that I didnt even feel hungry because too much was going on. I thought I could die. I got up and crawled to the kitchen and force fed myself a banana, struggling to swallow but trying so hard so that I wouldn\'t pass out. There were a lot of times like this. There was so much mental pain and physical suffering. No one really knew or could tell, because since I was in the binge cycle, my weight looked normal due to the "balance."\n\nTime went on, and I ended up trying to continue what I had before, but I would keep failing at my restriction. I wouldn\'t eat the entire day, but then 10 PM would hit and I would fall into a binge. I would try to make up for it the next day, not eating throughout the day because I thought Id be able to make it, but then the same thing would happen. Restriction wasnt making it through the day anymore, just constant binging.\n\nThis has been going on for 3-4 years. I always had the dream of getting back to the same lower weight, and that once I would restrict enough to get there, I could focus on getting healthy and eating normally... but only once I got there. Well, I was never able to get there again. Fast forward to now, my eating is still not normal. Whether its a binge or a restrict, I\'ve still not recovered. I started getting intense dizzy spells a few weeks ago. It was really scary.\n\nI saw a doctor and we did a few tests and saw that my blood sugar was low. I did some research, and it seems like its something that can happen and be dangerous with eating disorders. I decided I wanted to make a change.\n\nInstead of doing extremes, like binging or restricting, I decided to try and eat a normal amount. I will be honest with you guys, Im not doing complete miracle work; im still restricting a bit. However, not like before. The reason is because I am still wanting to lose weight. Nothing extreme, but I want to. Instead of the super restricted number of calories a day, Im having at least double of that. I will be honest; I still go to bed hungry a lot. But I tell myself Im healing and its a great start so I ignore that. I wasnt active during my issues in the past; I spent most days at home working on the computer. I started getting up every morning and going on 2-4 mile walks. I thought that this new lifestyle change would be amazing for me, and that I would instantly lose weight after stopping what became a 99% of the time binge.\n\nThe scale had showed a small amount of progress in the beginning, three weeks ago, pretty quickly. Then, it completely stopped. I have been stuck at the same weight ever since then. It is making me go insane. It is making me want to relapse. I keep telling myself just restrict, get your summer body fast, take all the pictures and wear all the outfits and do all of the things you want, and then start healing. I know mentally I shouldn\'t, but I am really really distraught. The weight Im at shouldn\'t be my bodies natural weight, because its still the weight that I would have while I was binging. I wake up every morning and check the scale and start crying. If a couple of pounds is the only difference, why not enjoy binges?\n\nWhy am I walking everyday, eating super clean and healthy, and working so hard for nothing? It feels useless. Im writing this post as a last resort because Im wondering if anyone knows why I am still going to bed hungry, but eating clean and a more normal amount, getting out there and exercising, but still not losing weight.\n\nI appreciate any help, Im feeling really desperate right now.\n\n\\*side note; Is it normal that now during recovery, if I don\'t eat for three hours between meals my body starts getting light headed and feeling like its going to shut down? It really scares me and triggers anxiety attacks. I dont know why my body has such an intense reaction to going without food for what I would assume are normal periods of time, especially now that im (apparently) doing better.'}, {'Disordered': 'Starting out in UX design and have a idea for a app to help people recovering from a ED - I want to get some feedback  A little about me - I’ve struggled with bulimia and anorexia for the past 9 years.

I don’t have a chubby face and my legs and neck are more defined. I’ve noticed that I have not been eating to maintain this weight. I feel horrible. I want to eat, but I am afraid I will start binge eating again. I had a binge eating problem last year and gained around a lot of weight. I don’t know what to do. I just wish I didn’t think about food all the time (focusing on if I eat it or not). I apologize is this is triggering, I can remove it if needed.'}, {'Disordered': "I'm so confused  I'm a teenaged girl(Adding this information Incase it affects any advice)\n\nFor the past few years I've found I'm just not hungry anymore. As I kid I would eat anything and everything at any time but I barely remeber those days anymore. It didn't start off too bad at first but it's gotten worse and worse over the years. Then a couple months back there was a mager change in my home life and it got a whole lot worse. For weeks I could barely eat to the point even my family members noticed when they never have before. Its worth noting that I deal with a lot of anxiety and my home situation and also another situation (it was a good thing just different) were making me anxious. Things got slightly better after a couple months but still a lot worse then it was before. I can't go to my family about this because they will think I'm anorexic. But the thing is I am not. I know I'm not because I don't care that much about my weight and how I look. I have a therepist and I'm thinking of getting her input before I go to my family because I recognise I need help and they might understand better with a professional opinion.\n\n*Triggers* Details on what it's like.\n•Most of the time I'm genuinely not hungry and can't stand to even think of food. When I have to eat it it makes me feel so sick. \n•Sometimes I get really really hungry and there's literally no amount of food I can eat that will fill me up but eventually it will just fade and I'm not hungry again\n•I find it easier to eat junk food then healthy food\n•Foods have been kinda split into two groups in my mind. A select few comfort foods I can eat without too much bother. Foods that make me gag to even think about eating even when I'm starving. And the ones in between that depending on how bad it is I may or may not be able to eat\n•I've picked up some bad habbits to avoid this getting discovered. Mainly dumping food when I'm able so I can eat semi-normally when people are watching.\n•I try to avoid skipping meals and if I have to dump something will substitute it for something easier(Usually some kind of bar that's easy to grab and I am able to eat) but if I'm not hungry at all. Which is often. I end up having to skip the meal. \n•I also feel really sick if I eat a full meal that would be considered an appropriate amount for my age\n\nI'm pretty sure that's everything and I hope this makes sence and I don't sound like I'm trying to make an issue out of nothing because this is so weird I can't figure it out and I've really been struggling.

But here is the thing.. \n\nI already did a lot for her, we talked about it so many times and I managed to talk her into at least talking to a doctor about it. She got this medicine that raise her appetite and she was on a really good way, wanting to recover which made me extremely proud and happy. I never left her side during this hard recovery, I was there when she started, I was there whenever she needed to talk about it, I was there whenever she fell back and had a bad day.

But nowadays it feels like she wants to drop all of that out of sudden again and I really don\'t know what to do.

She tries to cover it up in jokes, tells me about how her stomach gained "fat" and tweets about how to not eat behind your parents back. She knows that I know about that twitter account and she promised me to logg out of there, but as soon as she has a bad day, she\'s back on it, tweeting all kind of weird things about eating and food in general and at this point I am starting to get exhausted. \n\nI have a lot of things on my own which I never really speak about, because as I said you don\'t want to talk to your friend with anorexia about your actual needed work out because you\'re overweight and stuff like that because then she just goes into it like "Yeah, me too.

I am practically a senior citizen and I am very sure I have an ED, maybe two. I have the typical story. I began overeating as a young teen when my parent\'s drinking got out of control. Needless to say, the family imploded. Everyone began acting out, except me. I began to binge or restrict. Jump ahead some decades and many, many diets later, and I am currently underweight. A problem I never ever imagined I would have. I am also a holistic chef and wellness practitioner. I make beautiful and healthy food to help people get and stay healthy. I consult with people about their nutrition, or lack thereof, every day. I am a liar! I do not, and cannot practice what I preach. I am so over food. First, it was my everything, now I want nothing to do with it. I am happy with an empty belly. I have sought help, to no avail. My nurse practitioner just says "Why don\'t you eat more?". My therapist, bless her sweet heart, just grabs her self-compassion cards and has me choose some to read. My psychiatrist just offers me drugs. I try to eat regularly and plan my meals and it never works for more than a day or two. I could write a novel about my experiences over the last four decades.\n\nI am growing tired of the constant comments from people about my weight. I am none of their business. I do realize I have a problem, or two, but am at a loss over how to treat them. I think an inpatient program would be the best and fastest way to finally nip this in the bud, but I don\'t know that I qualify. I have also tried to find an ED therapist. ED\'s are pretty popular right now, most therapists have full schedules or have a waitlist. I want to walk my talk and be healthy before I began collecting social security!

I got excited about there being a loose snack in the vending machine (so I would get two for the price of one!!) but the card reader wasn’t working- and she said “it’s not like you’d need it anyways”.

How can I help?  Hi! I don\'t normally use reddit but I\'m at a loss, so hopefully someone here will be able to offer some insight and help me.\n\nMy best friend in the entire world (let\'s call him Eric) is a gay male in his early twenties (the relevancy to sharing this will come up later). We\'ve known each other for an incredibly long time and have been basically inseparable. He has suffered with depression and anxiety for as long as I\'ve known him. As we\'ve blossomed into adulthood, we of course have had less time to hang out but still see each other once a month if not more. I can confidently say that they are my best friend and always will be.\n\nEric is a work-a-holic. He is currently in medical school and works insane hours where eating is not a priority as he is caring for other people. He has also been single for a very long time.\n\nWe saw each other this weekend and I noticed that he wasn\'t himself when it came to eating, though, I chose not to bring it up as I figured he would bring this up to me if he felt it was necessary. I chalked it up as he was just not hungry. He has also lost a significant amount of weight in a short period of time. I was correct and he did in fact message me this morning and told me that he was suffering and needed to talk to someone about it but he didn\'t want me to respond with "too much" as he was working and didn\'t want to become overwhelmed. He told me that he knows he has developed a eating disorder. He expressed everything he was feeling and how if he missed a day at the gym he would start crying and if he started to count his calories for the day, it would make him throw up. He also mentioned that he feels like this is due to not having any male attention in his life. He has been single for probably 6 or 7 years. Lastly, he mentioned that he knows he needs to see a therapist because it is getting worse by the day but he refuses to go.\n\nHow do you not respond to that? My heart broke for him. I responded with a short, comforting message and explained that if he felt this way that we should get him help and that I\'d be happy to look up therapists covered by his insurance. I also typed up a long message in my notes which I shared with him and told him not to look at it until after work.\n\nHe didn\'t look at it. When I asked him if he had, he said that he was fine and that he appreciated everything but he was just stressed and explained that he will be okay. I don\'t mind that I took the time to write this message up, I\'m just scared for my friend and want to help him.\n\nAs someone who has helped this person through their depressive battles, has seen them at their worst and know how bad it can get, I really fear for his mental health. I want to respect his wishes not to talk about it anymore, but at the same time I feel like a terrible friend not doing anything... At the same time, what can I do?\n\nI feel like him reaching out to me was a cry for help and I don\'t want to insist that we talk about what is happening and get him help as I fear that it will only overwhelm him and he wont come to me in the future if and when this issue grows more severe. I want him to feel comfortable coming to me as I know how scary this world can be when you don\'t have someone.\n\nIf someone here has gone through this and has some advice for what I can do for my friend, I would greatly appreciate any advice I can get.

I rarely ever puke, maybe once every two months. But I stop myself from doing it EVERY day, everytime I eat anything forbidden I want to throw it out of myself. I am aware that bulimia is bad, but it sometimes seems less dangerous than diabetes. When I\'m hungry, and I have nothing "sugarless" to eat, I eat bread. Because I don\'t have time or energy or money to ALWAYS eat at the same time, healthy no sugar no oil food. I just can\'t eat salads anymore, they make me sick. Always the same, plain vegetables, tasteless meat. It is not hard to crash the diet. \n\nI am so f*cked up, I know I have to seek medical and psycological attention. But I just needed to vent somewhere, and I hope some of you can understand me. \n\nIt is not just about my weight, it is about my mental and physical health. I want to be happy, I want to have kids, I want to live long. I can\'t do that neither with diabetes or bulimia.'}, {'Disordered': "Eating is Painful  My treatment team really wants me to eat three meals a day but most of the time I can hardly fit two in without feeling painfully full.

(Afraid of drinking water)  In March 2021, I was at my heaviest weight ever. I realized that I needed to start a weight loss journey, so I started eating healthier and exercising a little.

Around four months into my weight loss journey (July 2021), I developed a very weird eating schedule. I would continue drinking the recommended daily amount of water, but I would stop drinking water and stop eating around the late afternoon because I noticed that this helped give me the best numbers on the scale when I weighed myself at night or in the morning. It's stupid because I know that I am still consuming the same amount of food and water everyday, but I was obsessed with seeing a smaller number on the scale.\n\nI've more or less stuck to this pattern of not eating/drinking after mid-afternoon for the past year, minus a few exceptions here and there. Every single time that I eat/drink outside of that time frame, I notice that I weigh much more the next day, and it discourages me from doing so again. I tried to go back to a regular eating schedule for a week, and I ended up gaining some weight, which scared me away from trying again.\n\nI hope this is the correct subreddit for asking this: How do I get back to eating/drinking normally?

But I feel like I’m moreso scared to get back into bad habits, and eating just one treat would send me back to where I was before. On top of all of that I’m in a summer college program where the dining hall isn’t open, so we use our school card to get meals at near by restaurants/fast food places. I think I’m really starting to fear what the workers think of me, even though I have no other options. I had this same fear when getting groceries over the academic year, which I spent in France. But now it’s to the point where I’ve been sitting/standing at the door of my dorm for 2 hours, hungry. I can’t bring myself to get food. I can tell I’m not eating enough anymore, just based on the number of meals I have in a day, and physical symptoms. But I hate knowing that the workers know my name and face now, despite serving so many people every day.

My ED started at 15 years old I am now in my early 20’s and can now eat normally after therapy. But my case is rare because the type of eating disorder I have is phobia-based where my throat muscles are impaired as a result of a traumatic experience and it’s called phagophobia (fear of choking). All these years where I was suffering with phagophobia is my body being in a never ending fight or flight mode and it’s caused my throat to lock up.\n\nMy ED was kind to me because it allowed me to at least eat right after I woke up. My throat would normally start working again but only after I had a good sleep. No matter what I did, breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, distractions. The only thing that allowed my throat to function again was sleeping, and to this day I don’t have an answer to why. I’d only have a morning meal and lived off of yogurt and pudding the rest of the day. If I’m lucky, I’d take a nap and then wake up and eat a meal again but that rarely happened.\n\nI am now in recovery and wanted some tips on how to allow my body to heal after all this. Especially since my calorie-intake was probably too low for my body to function normally since I was moderately active. I’m underweight and my body doesn’t signal hunger from being use to living without adequate food for too long.

A little back story. I’ve always been heavy set since I was a child because of some medicine I had to take as a kid. So it became very difficult for me to lose all the weight.

But the thing is the way I was doing it was by starving myself, and going hard on the exercise. And people would praise me with every pound lost. They didn’t know I was iron deficient, or that I was losing my hair or that I was sleeping so much cuz I barely ate. So my brain associated weight loss with praise from others. Skip to when pandemic began and I was gaining weight and I’m currently back to where I’ve always been. But now I have this immense guilt when I eat anything, I feel like no one is going to accept me if I don’t lose the weight again. I talked to my therapist and she said that having guilt when eating stuff like a cookie is normal for everyone and that if I lost weight the guilt would go away. And that I should even consider asking my doctor for medication to curb my appetite. And that I should count the calories of what I eat before I eat to see if I event should eat it.

If I’m eating around others and I finish first I feel gross.\n\n•I’m not sure if this has anything to do with it but cookies are my comfort food and is a food I’ll never turn down. My family jokes about they don’t know how I got ‘that way’ over cookies.\n\nThese are just things I can think of.'}, {'Disordered': '(Academic) Research to see if there is a relationship between childhood trauma in males developing eating disorders.    \n\nHello, my name is Lynn Williams.

My gf of five months now is suffering from an eating disorder. She only ever talks about it when she is so drunk she won’t remember. She has told me that her mother has been a huge motivator and will either control what she eats or force her to exercise if she eats something she shouldn’t. She has also expressed worry that her roommate who she is going abroad with this summer and living with next year makes her eating disorder worse by making comments and all around just making her aware of what she’s eating. She hasn’t talked about this with me sober and deflects anytime I have tried to bring it up. She has also expressed concern about talking about it with me as I am also recovering and she doesn’t want to trigger me. I don’t know what to do to help, the roommate and mom situation seems out of the scope of something I can handle and it’s difficult when she doesn’t want to talk about it.

TLDR; Eating is constantly on my mind, I can't go 10 minutes without thinking what I could eat now, have been feeling the effects on my back and knees of rapidly gaining weight. Want to start losing it again by working out but also change this mentality of always wanting to stuff myself whenever I get the opportunity.\n\nSorry for the vague title but I just don't know how to put it shortly. I've been a sweettooth my whole life, I like treating my taste buds with a cake, a pain au chocolat, or anything sweet. \n\nIt wasn't that much of a problem in my previous years because I was growing, and I grew to be quite tall so I could eat back then without a lot of consequences to my weight. Soon after I stopped growing, the pandemic dropped which was a good thing for me because when I go outside and ride my bike to school, I usually pass a bakery and then I can't for the life of me ride past it without stopping for something sweet, that usually has a lot of calories, like a doughnut, pain au chocolat, maybe a tarte. \n\nBecause of this and because the pandemic is starting to fade, or at least the mandates are non existent now except for in hospitals. I got quite a bit of weight in the past semester. I always tell myself at home to not stop at the bakery anymore every day, maybe once a week to treat myself but I always find myself stopping my bike and going in line to treat my taste buds once again.\n\nNow this problem doesn't only occur when I'm riding my bike to my uni, but also at home. I'm studying for example but all I can think about is stuffing myself with food at times. This can be healthy food but also not so healthy food, I check the time every 10 minutes to see how close I am to lunch or dinner, even though I'm not that hungry. \n\nFor now I'm overweight, but it doesn't really reflect on my body yet, except for my face which is getting a bit more fat and round, you can't really see my growing man boobies, my belly that is starting to become rounder too. This is mostly because I'm quite a tall and big built person in general, with broad shoulders and thick legs, which is a family trait lol.\n\nMy goal is to stop this before it becomes a bigger problem, I already decided to work out and go back to my original weight, but I also want to battle the mental side of this problem and stop my binge eating. When there are snacks in house like a bag of chips, it's always finished on the same day it was bought. \n\nMy family genes don't favour me with a good back, nearly everyone in my family has severe back problems, my height and weight make me vulnerable to these problems too. I'm already starting to feel more pain in my back on a daily basis, running and walking hurts my knees and hips. \n\nNot only is this a problem to my body, but also financially, I spend like 120€ a month, just on snacks.\n\nHow can I change this mentality of constantly wanting to eat something?"}, {'Recovery': "weight loss for a surgery while in ED recovery  I'm planning a surgery for next year (hopefully May ish), and the only doctor who performes the procedure and takes my insurance has a pretty strict BMI limit.

For decades I weighed between 190-220 pounds. 6 years ago, I divorced my husband of 28.5 years and magically the extra weight began to come off. While married, I would binge eat and then restrict. I was addicted to fast food and sugar, an alcoholic, and a major restricter (even though I was fat). The more calories I took in through alcohol, the less food I would eat. Once I left the husband and alcohol behind, it was easy to restrict and lose weight. Since I am in control of me now, I eat the way I want, or not. No one tells me what to do anymore.

I love her more than anyone and I care about her deeply. She has mentioned a few times casually in the past that she throws up her food when she eats too much or because she wanted to be thinner. She is aware that I don't like that she does that to herself and that I still find her attractive no matter what. She also mentioned that she intentionally threw up before one of our first dates together because she was worried about her appearance. She told me that her mother had confronted her on it in the past because she discovered that she could eat and not have to gain weight, but she continues to do it to this day. Most recently she told me she does it because she doesn't like the feeling of food in her stomach but she likes to eat. I suspected that this was the case, but I didn't think that she would continue to do it that often. Because she lives with her mother I thought that if I brought it up with her and suggested that my girlfriend see a psychiatrist or eating disorder specialist that she may have a better chance of getting the help she needs and receiving treatment. I've threatened to break up with her for continuing with her habits in the past but it seems that the problem is too far rooted for that to help. I even told her that I might tell her mother that she continues to vomit her food intentionally. She then briefly threatened me by saying that she would tell her mother something about me that I don't want her to know. After I somewhat talked her out of it and she said she wouldn't bring up the subject anymore, I still feel that I want to help her in someway. I'm afraid that if she saw a specialist that her illness may not meet the requirements for being diagnosed with bulimia nervosa because she may not engage in her self-destructive behaviour as much. Also that she may just lie about everything. Once again I love my girlfriend and anything I do for her whether it somewhat impacts her life or not, I would do it out of love.

From when I was toddler till early teenager I had what I guess is now called ARFID. I had no appetite whatsoever and barely ate at all during those years. Because of it I never had the growth spurts other kids my age should have had. And when it comes to men being short had this horrible stigma so it’s caused me to be really self conscious throughout my life. Thankfully I grew out of ARFID at the beginning of my teenage years and was good for a couple of years. \n\nFlash forward to ages from late teen to now. I’m now struggling with binge eating. I eat all day everyday and can’t force myself to stop. I’ve since become overweight, not so much that it seems impossible to lose but I’m even more self conscience than I was before. It doesn’t matter if I work out, cut out sugar and soda, cut out fried food, or only eat healthy, I can’t lose the weight because I’m constantly eating too much. I’ve pretty much given up on weight loss until I can get it under control. \n\nSo now it’s time for my question. For those who struggle with binge eating, how do you control yourself? That’s my biggest issue, that I have no self control. I want to start getting healthier so I can finally be comfortable with my body so any and all advice here is welcome.'}, {'Disordered': 'I Think i could be developing an eating disorder?

This was in Feb 2020 so right before the pandemic. I never actually started the PHP because I didn\'t want to miss school and it was also $$$ and also there is alot of conflict within my family so it wouldn\'t have been possible for me to do. \n3. This is the most controversial, but I have alot of trouble with the recovery dialogue. I don\'t know what it is, but sometimes it makes me so angry and uncomfortable. It\'s almost like it\'s condescending and infantilizing me. Like when people say to "fuel your body" it makes me feel as if I can only eat when my body needs fuel which is a tricky mindset to recover from/change. Again, this is my own perspective and inner struggle and it is not my intention to appear to be shaming anyone for having a different mindset than me. I just feel as if saying "good job nourishing your body" is the same as telling someone  "good job pampering yourself" after they wash their hands.
