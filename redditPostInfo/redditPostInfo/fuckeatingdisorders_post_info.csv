Disordered,"Is protein essential?  Got told by my nutritionist that according to my food diary I'm averaging 5-10g of protein a day. I eat poptarts, crisps, white bread with mayonnaise and cucumber slices, bananas, cereal with oatmilk, a lot of candy, juice/full sugar soda, ramen.

She told me since I'm 8 months into recovery I need to start balancing my meals, incorporating healthy fats, protein and a serving of veg into at least one of my meals a day, and aim for 20g protein minimum which should be increased at a later point.

Thing is, I'm genuinely happy eating my current diet, it's food I love and food that anorexia deprived me from. I don't want to eat vegetables or chicken or eggs, it sounds soooo unappealing to me. Anyway drinking my calories in sugary lattes or milkshakes and eating ramen means I can fulfill my recovery minimums with minimal digestive discomfort. 

The few times in recovery I've eaten high fibre and high protein meals while eating out with family (like a jacket potato with chilli con carne and a side salad) I suffered for hours afterwards and felt super full. I don't have extreme hunger and physical fullness makes me forget food exists, I need to have things that pass through me within 1-2 hours like a poptart so my stomach reminds me to eat.

What do I do? I'm still weight restoring (bmi is very mildly UW) and I like this nutritionist but this feels like a goal for when I'm maintaining, not actively trying to gain which is already really hard"
Recovery,"gym accountability without triggering myself?  i’ve considered myself fairly recovered on the scale of not recovered to recovered, for the last few years, however the one kind of lasting thing my ED has on me is that calorie tracking triggers me. i think it will forever and that’s fine. i’m looking at becoming more muscular (which requires an increase in both calories and gym time, to build muscle in a healthy way) but am not sure how to keep myself accountable for the gym/healthy eating without tracking calories/time in the gym. has anyone else run into this problem and has any suggestions?"
Recovery,"extreme hunger problems  i need help. every night i wake up with the feeling that i need to throw up bc i´ so hungry. i eat then two toast every night but then i have the whole day problems with fueling my hunger bc i´m craving so much food ( even tho i´ not hungry i still want to eat ) and my head always tell me that i already ate too much bc of the toasts.i always eat 3 meals and 3 snacks ( even more ) but i could eat ALOT more and idk what to do.

&#x200B;

is this extreme hunger ? ( what are the signs ) and do you guys have tips how to fuel my hunger and could you maybe tell me your experiences with EH :)

&#x200B;

edit: i cant talk to a nutrisients or psychologyst bc i dont have one ( when i have good luck i maybe get one my the end of the year :(   )"
Recovery,"is anyone else in a phase where they are angry at the world while recovering from an ed?  been *actually* recovering for a few weeks now and i have just felt generally angry at everything. angry at society for existing, angry at the traffic, angry that i have to work, etc. not anger that i would express to anyone, but just silent rage inside you. anyone else?"
Recovery,"Really struggling with EH  Once I start eating (not all the time) I can’t stop I’m not doing it emotionally but it still feels like binging to me I can think about anything but “what can I eat next” I tried to play my games and read and talk to someone but it didn’t help it just made me more hungry and I feel gross usually I don’t after EH I’ve learnt to deal with it so I don’t know why I can’t handle it now? It’s 1pm Australian, Victoria time and I usually have EH at 7-8pm. Once I eat I can’t stop even when I tried :("
Recovery,"people who use the Recovery Road app - what time do you use to log meals, when you start or when you finish?  honestly im thinking of just not bothering with the app since logging meals into an app is stressful even if i’m not counting anything other than if im eating at all but like i just had dinner and it took me nearly an hour to finish - not even cos i didn’t like it, made a frankly delicious tofu and rice bowl with some veggies - but because i was just not hungry. i think changes in the air pressure are fucking up my appetite or something but ANYWAYS i did finish it. the question is do i log it as 7:45 (when i sat down to eat it) or 8:30 (when i finished it). this is such a stupid question i’m sorry it’s just something bugging me kinda."
Recovery,"Can you get PTSD from anorexia?  I dealt with anorexia during my sophomore year of college last year. It was much more severe spring semester rather than in fall - I had gone back thinking I was doing a lot better, but relapsed due to health/environmental issues.

I’m back at the same college for my junior year and it is intense. I’m physically doing better/recovered, but I haven’t received formal therapy for this, the aftermath, or the things that caused it. 

Last year still eats at me though. Sometimes walking around campus I feel like I can’t breathe, or am too scared to move, especially after walking by certain buildings/restaurants/walking paths. After classes today I got back to my apartment and started sobbing in my bathroom, then immediately got more panicked because I was reminded of how much time I spent in the bathroom floor at my previous apartment in spring hiding from my former roommates.

I still carry so much shame and resentment with me. I’m terrified of exhaustion, even though it’s inevitable. I have so much anger and fear at the mental and clinical health systems that failed me too, last year. I feel alone. I’m scared."
Recovery,"I don't at all mean this insensitively, but how do you deal with the guilt that EDs are kind of a FWP? Not that they aren't serious, not that they aren't deadly, but they're a first world phenomenon. I feel so much guilt and shame about struggling with this.  People are dying all over the world from starvation and I'm here vomiting my food?  People in lesser developed countries don't experience this stuff.  Is this even a real problem or did I make it up?  Why can't I just snap out of it?  etc.  These are question I ask myself.

Again I don't mean to shame or judge anyone at all...I'm just trying to deal with my own shame, and wondering if anyone has advice.  So far I've told myself that maladaptive coping mechanisms exist worldwide (such as drug and alcohol addiction), and yes maladaptive mechanisms that involve food can pretty much only exist where food is plentiful, but food is only a vehicle for the maladaptive symptoms if that makes sense.

Any other words of wisdom?"
Recovery,"fuck calories!!!  i had not one, but two rolls today!! my mom brought home some rolls and they were just too good not to eat. i was hesitant on eating a second roll but who cares!!! proud of myself for eating two!!"
Recovery,"All in  I watched Stephanie Buttermore’s video on a year of going all in, and honestly it was so eye opening. It’s so helpful to watch someone go through the process of extreme hunger/ weight gain, and honestly it’s made me want to go all in. 

I texted my best friend, just telling her about the video and how I wanted to do that and her response was “please please do it” (I don’t know why that made me cry but it did). She told me how if she wants food, she just goes and gets it, no second thoughts, and that is just so crazy to me. I was craving cereal so badly, but I had already eaten dinner and desert, but she told me that she would just go and get it, so I did. 

I’m now sat in bed watching Netflix and finishing a packet of Oreo’s. I’m not sure how long this motivation is going to last, but honestly I’m just so fed up of being constantly hungry, constantly thinking about food, constantly scared of losing control. Honestly just fuck it."
Recovery,"I might be recovered. Thanks PB  I'm currently looking for an artist to tattoo a peanut on me. The day I ate a measly 1/4th of a (regular, so small) jar of pb for the first time changed something inside of me. I was petrified, shocked and disgusted at myself, but physically I felt wonderful. I crossed a line and never looked back. I had been doing very well the months prior, slowly and gradually improving mentally, but looking back I feel like I still wasn't truly all in until that moment. Since then, I've regularly consumed up to 4 times that amount of pb in a sitting (just did lolll), as well as numerous other foods in huge quantities (which I had started to do a bit before already, since my EH began to set in around that time). I finally understood that I had been experiencing mental hunger because I still needed MORE than someone who hadn't been ill and I wasn't just boring, anxious and food obsessed. 

When I got EH, I suddenly made more progress in a few weeks than I had in months or even years before. Physically, my world turned upside down. I'm not always cold anymore!!! My bowels work so well because I'm eating plenty of fats and I just genuinely feel good. I'm pretty much immune to bruising and my bloods came back perfect. I still need to restore a little though. Mentally, the difference is even bigger. I simply don't give two shits about FDOE videos anymore and... I don't think about food the whole time anymore?!?!?! My mental and physical hunger cues are almost aligned, but I still eat far more than 'normal' or pre-ED. I usually don't think about checking or calculating calories. The way I think about movement, calories and bodies is one I never thought was possible. The spontaneity I have around food blows my mind still. I realized that a lot of the *mental* symptoms of my restrictive ED drastically improved or disappeared just by eating more. It took mere months.

My relationship with food, exercise and my body is not perfect so therefore one could say I'm not recovered yet, but if it wasn't for the past, one could absolutely not class me as eating disordered anymore. 

I think I am recovered from my ED. A big shoutout to peanut butter, which sponsored my recovery with thousands of gorgeous calories and is therefore responsible for the healthier body and mind I'm in now 🥺"
Recovery,"Coffee isn't carbs  I'm finally cutting caffeine---at least until I can drink it for the right reasons.

I love coffee. But ever since I cut out cream and sugar, I couldn't tell you if I loved coffee for its taste or for how it would somehow give me energy and reduce my appetite at no caloric cost.

When I was at my lowest weight, whenever I was hungry, I would make myself drink a cup of coffee. 

It got to the point where I was drinking pots upon pots of coffee every single day, and yet I still felt fatigued. 

I was terrified of the EH that would appear whenever I didn't drink several cups with every ""meal"" I was consuming. I thought that getting more hungry after eating was a sign that I just needed more caffeine. 

So I'm going to set aside my compulsive java for a while. Wish me luck."
Recovery,"Anyone else feel exhausted after eating a meal?  After I eat a meal (not binge), I feel like I need to lay down and rest. 

I wonder if I’m eating too fast? Or is this just part of recovery?"
Disordered,"Cost of Monte Nido vs ERC (Chicago)  Hi y’all.

I’m needing to go to res and I’m between monte nido and ERC both in Chicago. Monte Nido seems nicer and more my jam but they also seem much more expensive since the food is cooked by a chef and there are private rooms and less beds compared to ERC. Does anyone know if the cost (with or without insurance) is comparable between the two organizations?"
Disordered,"sick of feeling like i'm not sick, wish i had one specific ED instead of whatever i do have  i just want to preface this with i don't mean to invalidate anyone with this. it is just how i feel about *myself* and i do not think of others this way. i try to rationalise that since i don't think less of others in a similar situation as me i shouldn't feel like this about myself but it is hard.

ever since i heard someone call people ""wannarexics"" i can't help but feel like i'm one of *them*. i truly do not think anyone can be one except for **me** and i hate it. 

i just feel like a ""bad"" anorexic person because i don't restrict like i used to and i don't have the control over my eating like i used to but i also don't fit the criteria of bulimia. i've tried finding anything fitting what i'm experiencing but the only thing i can find i fit into enough is EDNOS. i *know* it is a valid diagnosis and i don't think any less of other people diagnosed with that but for me? it just doesn't feel like ""enough"" when it comes to me. if i were to be able to seek a diagnosis and treatment i think that would be it but the way the eating disorder care is formed today in my country i truly do not think i could even begin to get help. especially not after my last attempt at seeking help. 

i'm just tired of this and i feel like i need to be a certain way (bulimic or anorexic) to even begin to get help by the psych system here. what's worse is that i know my thoughts are coming from a place of truth. people are treated like shit for this all the time."
Recovery,"Challenging chocolate.  So I've had this [biscoff chocolate](https://www.worldofsweets.de/out/pictures/master/product/1/schogetten-lotus-biscoff-100g-no1-3710.jpg) lying around for a week or two and I always only took one or two pieces. Well, today, after having had dinner and ice cream after dinner, I decided to take another piece. Then I wanted another. I then looked to see how many pieces were left and I realized I had barely eaten any of it. So I decided to eat an entire row. In the process I started thinking ""Girl, you've been trying to gain weight, yet you're always so controlled. Eat as much of the chocolate as you want to. Who cares if you eat all of it?""

So I brought the chocolate with me to my bed and I ate the rest of it while watching YT. I can't remember the last time I've allowed myself to snack like this. And honestly, I feel like today was a completely normal day of eating. I ate a bit less for breakfast than I usually do (a sandwich, a joghurt and an apple), got a Poke Bowl for lunch, had an apple as afternoon snack, then spaghetti bolognese for dinner, an ice cream sandwich for dessert and then the chocolate. It's a lot for me and I would have freaked out over it not too long ago, but I'm fine right now. 

The urge to exercise is present, yes, but I won't allow myself to.

Today's food was satisfying. I need to eat more. The sooner I recover, the better. And I need to have days like these in order to reach food freedom.

I do feel very out of control around chocolate and I would have labeled this as a binge a few months ago. But I think I was in control this time? Like, I stopped and thought about it before I decided to finish the chocolate. I've always loved chocolate. Part of me wants to never buy it again so I can't have this amount of chocolate in one sitting again, but that would just harm my relationship with it even more. 

I have made progress with it, I think. I have to keep challenging it."
Recovery,"I’m going to eat  I always gaslight myself into believing that I’m not actually struggling and it’s partly bc of what I mention further down. 

So I can eat, I do eat, I get excited a lot of times when it’s “allowed” for me to eat, I enjoy eating. Until I don’t. So now I’m going to eat. I’m going to enjoy it, but after I’m going to feel so extremely guilty. But I DO enjoy eating. It’s only the guilt and fear. Food is good I’m just afraid of it. 

(Okay I do hear people say it formulated in this way but a lot of times it’s as if people just are some kind of subhuman that can go millions of years w o eating. Which I know isn’t true I just hate that that’s the representation I see. It’s like I have to reach an unreachable goal to please others. I’m overweight I eat and I also have a restrictive eating disorder and that’s final!) I hate that every time I want to see a relatable post about eating and food guilt it always contains ways of compensating. I know that’s what ed’s does to people but how am I supposed to find something relatable and safe or funny when it’s basically telling me “it’s only alright to eat if you compensate/are ready to compensate”. I know it’s not about me don’t get the wrong idea I just don’t understand how people can find it comforting to hear someone say “I just ate and now it’s game over for my body” (obv not that formulation, iykyk)

I’m tired of always telling myself I’m not enough while knowing that’s what a lot of people think too."
Recovery,"Desperate to recover  Currently seeing a psychologist for lots of trauma/eating disorder issues. I have my third session tomorrow but we haven't delved into how to stop purging at all. Have not been fully diagnosed but I purge almost three times a day lately, every single day. I am exhausted. I am desperate to stop this but like many addictions it is hard/feels impossible. Please don't say ""just stop"", I have tried since I was 14, I am 28 now lol. But now that I'm a mum I know I need to commit to fully stopping.

I am wondering what the best course of recovery for bulimia or ednos in Melbourne, Australia is. I don't have health insurance. My husband and I are both teachers- we have savings but not heaps since buying a house last year. 

Should I get health insurance? I was matched with my psychologist because she has dealt with eating disorders before. It is a slow process. Does anyone have any experience recovering from this? I am not underweight, my weight fluctuates- I am a ""normal"" weight for my height so I'm frightened that my psychologist is not taking me seriously. She doesn't say much, I feel like I just talk a lot. Am I expecting too much too quickly? This is my first time in therapy so I don't know what to expect.     

I also want to add that I feel like because I’m at such a “normal” weight I can’t fully recover. I still want to lose weight. I want to do it in a healthy way though, because I know purging just doesn’t work. But now I feel I do it just to not gain any weight rather than lose and because I actually CANNOT handle being physically full. 


Sorry if this is all over the place lol."
Recovery,"pursuing treatment + life update  hey :)

I wanted to start off by saying thank you to everyone in this sub, yall have honestly helped me so much and I appreciate every single one of you 💕

for the past year, ive been in and out of treatment, and ive signed myself out of residential/inpatient AMA every single time. but ive realized with all of this time that im not going to recover without more help, so im going back to treatment. this time, im determined to stay for as long as I need so I can finally get out of the quasi recovery-relapse cycle ive been trapped in. I don't want to go, but I realize its what I have to do."
Recovery,"Nightmares of binging and purging  So recently I've been trying to challenge my eating disorder , I realized I was either restricting or binging and purging was a never ending cycle. I've stopped both about a week ago and been having night mares of me binging and purging is this normal?"
Recovery,"I hate how my parents don't allow me to respect my meal plan  So i am in recovery (week two) and have been trying my damndest to hit my intake for the week but my parents make it so damn hard.

I am an adult, i should be able to eat whatever i damn well please and I am aiming for low volume, higher calorie meals but they think that low volume = low intake because they're morons

i work with a nutritionist and have my goals, but i ALWAYS get comments on how little i am eating, how my 'meals' aren't enough etc.

they have no idea what they're talking about which is double infuriating because my mother forces me to meal plan for her so SHE KNOWS THAT THINGS LIKE PASTA AND PEANUT BUTTER HAVE AN INSANE CALORIC CONTENT but for some reason they don't understand

if i make a giant stir fry of veggies and shrimp, it's 300 cals but perfectly fine

meanwhile a pb and j at 500 is totally unacceptable for me to eat even though it won't make me feel like i am dying afterwards

Recovery,"I need some resources to help a loved one understand/know how to support me during recovery  I’ve found that some Instagram accounts have some helpful posts that are informative and am looking to collect some to help my partner and parent understand more about what’s going on for me, what would be helpful, and understanding more about EDs (AN in particular). 

I can tend to have trouble communicating my needs and have a fear of being misunderstood. I’m realising that I’m going to need more support during recovery as it’s become really easy to slip into disorder behaviours and it’s not always easy to self regulate. I’ve found that sending through resources like posts and podcasts have allowed me to open up a bit more so I’d love to have any you find helpful. 

Much appreciated :)"
Recovery,"Life after Extreme Hunger  I was wondering if somebody else has the same experience as me: 
Started with recovery half a year ago and immedietly EH kicked in. I gave in, despite im in the „normal“ weight range. Anyway, hunger cues came back, all good till my vacation started. I always ate till im satisfied and didnt restrict anything, probably gained some weight but not that much. Since my returning, i got no more hunger cues and the EH vanished. Im not thinking about food all day, which is a clear win for me, but the lack of hunger cues (doesnt matter which meal time, its all day long) bothers me. Could it be that i reached my set point weight in that short period of time? Im not near that range i was pre-ed. 

Maybe someone got any clue whats going on in my body, since the hunger cue was always a good feedback to me that i have to eat and my body needs something."
Recovery,"How does a normal non-disordered person eat?  I’ve had some sort of ED for as long as I can remember. I’ve cycled through BED, AN, BN, and now I’m currently sitting very uncomfortably with OSFED. 

I really want to recover but I just have absolutely no clue how people just EAT. I watch WIEIAD videos and there’s almost always some sort of diet attached. They’ll drink hot water and lemon to kickstart their digestion, or they’ll add some greens powder for nutrients, or they’ll eat 50 fucking boiled chicken breasts. There always seems to be at least a little bit of disordered thinking sprinkled in with their seasoning. 

So how do you even recover? Can you just hold onto a few disordered behaviours because it’s no more than a regular person? Do you just eat freely? But for me eating freely leads to binges, so do I just fucking binge? What the actual fuck do I even do?"
Recovery,"Want People To Be Aware  I had a friend in treatment and I just was notified of him passing away sadly due to the ED;s evil intentions.

""If you do not FEEL right, then you ARE right""  This was his last sentence to me.  I didn't think of it in depth, but I know now in recovery. If it FEELS awkward, different or uncomfortable it means you ARE right.  ED lies and deceives and makes it so the uncomfortability makes us stop.  Don't.

I'll never give up my recovery aspect and everyone else should keep fighting as well. Uncomfortable.......you ARE doing it right, keep fighting.

P:S:   ...............Just ate an entire box of Fruit Loops in his honor."
Recovery,"I ate four times today. I am struggling  I’ve gained weight.  Some days I eat once. Other days I eat twice. But since recovering from days of restriction, I’ve never had this much in one day.  Now I am plagued with anxiety. My body was hungry but my brain is beating me up. In much need of a pep talk.  This weekend I asked my sister if I gained weight and her reply was, “you were scary skinny, you look normal now”. I know I’m just about to start my period, but I can’t help but lay in bed beating myself up."
Recovery,"Avoiding extreme hunger with work  I'm in my second and almost third months of recovery and I've been experiencing extreme hunger everyday since the beginning. I've gain so much weight and i'm really depressed about it. Now that I have more energy to do thing, I can go back to work. The thing is that i'm almost ""happy"" to go to work because I don't have time to eat as much as I do at home. In my days off I feel like I only eat because i'm bored and I feel like it's not extreme hunger anymore. I don't want to have extreme hunger anymore, I feel like it will never end and i'm so scared and alone to having it for so long.."
Recovery,"affirmation ramble for me ('n anyone else)  today i've eaten candy bars, crumb cakes, bagels, bowls of rice and pasta, and 3 supermarket muffins. the last one is stressing me out a lot rn- i ate the last 2 late at night when no one was around, when i wasn't hungry, and didn't feel like i could stop. now i'm very physically uncomfortable. still, i will survive.

just because i'm past weight restoration doesn't mean i no longer have unconditional permission to eat.

i can eat any quantity of anything at any time.

i don't need to punish my body to earn anything. i am allowed to eat however much i want regardless of the last time i worked out.

it's okay to eat unbalanced; trust your body and what it wants.

stay conscious of your cravings and honor them. eat with intentionality and be present in the moment.

recovery does not end with a number on the scale, it ends when i no longer feel guilty for eating in ""excess.""

i don't need to control my intake. i don't need to make up for it the next day.

i will be okay. today will not determine my worth in life.

feeling guilt and stress is more harmful for me than what i've eaten. 

i will remember how unpleasant eating to physical discomfort feels and try to spread food out in the day more.

i'm done being scared of fat gain and body changes, because i value who i am underneath my appearance more than i value control over something so fleeting.would this stress me out in two years? this discomfort will pass, but these urges won't unless i confront them,

i am HEALING. regardless of my weight or body fat my body and brain are learning: what makes me physically sick, what mentality is or isn't healthy.

do not resort to old coping mechanisms to relieve the panic. do not count, do not google. tell yourself that you will be okay and that doing that thing is going to hurt you, not help you.

distract yourself. remind yourself of what you truly enjoy. put something warm on your stomach and watch a show.

one day of discomfort does not make you a failure. you are worthy, and you deserve full recovery."
Recovery,Im so confused😭  so I thought I had extreme hunger a few weeks ago and so I decided to honor that. but this past week I thought about restricting again and all of a sudden I get hungry. So I learn not to do that because I generally get more hungry when I try to restrict. But today all I did was eat when I got home from school and I wasn’t even really hungry but I wasn’t full or satisfied either. Is this me developing BED or am I just experiencing mental hunger? do I listen to it or should I get more help? It’s like I’m not even hungry but my mind craves things so I eat it and then I eat a lot but I’m still never fully satisfied. I don’t know what to do anymore😭
Recovery,"my hands got fatter and going back to the gym (9 months all-in)  TW: Just in case, some mention of how much I've gained (I hid in spoilers) and how much weight I lifted (I did not hide)

it's been like 9 months all-in. I think my hunger has gone down a bit. There's some days were it's still extreme but not super often.

I went to the gym today because I just wanted to do a couple sets of deadlifts. The way you scan in is by placing your hand onto this machine. I did it and it was invalid. I went to the front desk to redo the scan and the guy told me that usually it still works. The machine scans the top of your hand and matches it with what's on file. He's been able to use his same scan for 3 years. He said sometimes people break their hands and it heals different so that's why they need to do the re-scan. After I did the re-scan, a few moments passed and I realized... My hand looks different because I gained >!40+!< pounds. I didn't think it looked that different but I guess it does? I'm not mad about it, just thought it was interesting.

I also only did like 2 sets of like 3 reps at like 135 lbs for sumo deadlifting and like 2 sets of like 3-4 reps for conventional at 95 lbs. I was like, damn I'm really weak... Because, when I was overexercising I was doing like 195-200 lbs for sumo and \~150 lbs conventional. Someone on a different post I made here had reminded me that gaining x lbs means you're walking and moving with x lbs. 

I know what I'm about to say isn't conclusive by any means but it helped me today. I applied that logic to the deadlifts. I gained >!40+!< so yeah even though I'm more nourished, I still have that extra weight on me that I'm carrying along w/ whatever barbell/weights I'm lifting. And when I did the math 135 + what I gained = about what I was lifting during the ED. I just thought this type of reasoning might help some of you if you were overexercisers who stopped to recover and went back only to find you're unable to lift as much as you used to.

Anyway, I think I'm just gonna take it slow and go once in a while for short sessions. I don't think my body's strong enough or adjusted to my new weight for me to do more than one exercise"
Recovery,"In my class we’re creating meal plans, so I’m doing one for myself! Might trigger me, idk  It’s going to be rough for at least this week, but I’m hoping next week or so I’ll finally be talking to a nutritionist that can help me. Lately I’ve been undereating all week and then binging on the weekend, so I hope I can just uh stop that? Just a personal update, support or words of advice are welcome!"
Recovery,"snacking post-""recovery""  i chose not to go to the gym for about a week until today when I felt like it, but I couldn't go this afternoon bc I had a party (w/ crumb cakes + bagels w cream cheese, slay). My mom told me not to go to the gym after the party to work on other stuff, so I haven't gone, but I've continued honoring aaalll even potential signs of mental hunger including obviously 3 meals and 3 snacks and as extra, a large grocery store muffin, some graham crackers, and a literal entire bag of Goldfish. tbh it's making me feel a bit guilty as I'm far beyond weight restored and at residential, my snack portion intended for rapid weight gain was only half of a muffin. I also know that I've eaten a lot today because of the party. I've been snacking a lot recently, eating whatever snacks or baked goods are on the kitchen table, and an ED voice is tickling the back of my brain telling me that I shouldn't be because I haven't gone to the gym and because I don't *need* to gain weight anymore. i could use some support from anyone else fighting off the ED after being deemed ""healthy"""
Recovery,"I got my period back!!  I won’t lie I feel like I wasn’t as worried as I probably should have been throughout losing it.

I lost it at the very, very beginning of my eating disorder. It didn’t even occur to me that it would have consequences and everyone convinced me it was normal because of my change in diet. I knew it wasn’t but I let myself believe the lies because it’s easier to be stuck in denial than face the truth.

I didn’t expect for my period to come back, really. Especially since I lost it so early on. I definitely still have a lot of poor mental issues and viewpoints on things. I’m sad to say that I still struggle with the concept of ever returning to the weight I previously was. In my mind I was just never going to get my period back because I would never be that weight again. I don’t know if I’ll be that weight again, I’m consistently increasing and could be so this is definitely a mentality I need to work on.

However, I got it today out of the blue. There was absolutely no signs but it’s come on heavy. And it feels so silly to say I’m ecstatic. I’m still young but I’ve always dreamed of being a mother and it’s something I know I want in my life. It’s something that has made me so happy and honestly just fuels me to recover more because I know that everything I’m doing is having positive effects for me. How can weight gain be so negative is my body is starting to work properly again.

Anyway; yeah. I try to stay away from Reddit and ED forums in general as they often feed into my self loathing and harmful thoughts but I was so so thrilled and had to tell someone!!"
Recovery,"win for me!!!  i usually dont let myself have cereal, and if i do i weigh it out and make sure it’s the normal portion. and i barely use any milk. today i had a normal serving of milk and two of the recommended servings for cereal. granted i feel extremely bad, but i wanted it! and it’s okay for me to have what i want. it was hard for me to let myself have it but idc!!"
Recovery,"Bloating :(  Uhm so I just had dinner, which was a huge fry up of fried potatoes, onion, mushrooms with a fried egg and [something similar to meat loaf](https://www.gutekueche.at/storage/media/recipe/13525/conv/leberkaese-default.jpg). And it was a huge portion. I finished all of it, though it was very difficult for me mentally. And now I have this extreme bloated and tight feeling in my stomach. I'm not used to this kind of fullness. It's so uncomfortable. 

My mom usually lets me choose my own portions, but this time it was already on the plate. She must be losing her patience... Man, I don't feel good right now. My mom and my stepdad both left some potatoes on their plates and my mom's portion wasn't even half as big as mine. I need to distract myself now. I'll be fine tomorrow. This isn't an excuse for restriction. I just need to remember this."
Recovery,"My partner triggers me  I have struggled with an eating disorder for over four years, and have decided to begin recovery maybe about a month ago. My partner has also dealt with similar problems in the past. We are in a long distance relationship which means I can't actually see them. They know about my eating problems as well.

Now for a while I things were going fine for me, my eating habits stabilized a lot, and I thought things were going fine for them too, but just yesterday they broke down and told me among other things that they have unintentionally lost a lot of weight and are now severely underweight. 

I can't deal with that at all, they told me exact numbers as well, and it's just even more triggering since we are basically the same height (and were the same weight). I can't feel anything except absolute despair, maybe it's wrong to make it about me but I also discussed with them that they need to gain the weight back and they agreed, but only to gain back some of it, and it all stresses me out so much even writing this makes me cry. The thought constantly creeps back into my mind, its such a small number and it's horrible. I don't know what to do and don't have any kind of support system. I have been completely thrown back and now suffer again even thinking about eating."
Recovery,Post therapy chocolate  I told my therapist that I didn’t want to be weighed and I still allowed myself to have post therapy coffee + chocolate bar despite not knowing if that number had gone up or down. It was terrifying and my head was screaming the whole time about not deserving/ being out of control but I did it because fuck you ED.
Recovery,Should I eat a certain amount of times a day?  So I’ve been following my extreme hunger and it started with eating from waking to sleep . But it’s suppressed into eating once a day but in that one time I eat a lot and then maybe ill eat again something towards the end of the day. My question is should I try to eat 3 times a day?  When I eat once I get super bloated and don’t feel like doing anything for the rest of the day because I’m so stuffed. So maybe if I eat 3 times a day my body won’t ask for it all within that one time I’m eating? What’s your experience with eating a number of times a day? Thanks
Recovery,"Confusion about set point theory  Hey I'm currently in recovery and my current confusion seems to be this:

-I was told by my nutritionist that it's normal to gain past my ""set point"" (my adult weight before I developed the ED) in recovery and that I wouldn't necessarily lose this weight again 

-People saying that your set point naturally changes throughout your life due to age, lifestyle factors, physical illness, pregnancy, etc

-People saying they overshot their set point by 50lbs+ before they began maintaining (so clearly the arbitrary number you had as your set point wasn't actually your set point?)

-People saying they've been maintaining within a narrow range for years post recovery with no effort or attention paid to their weight 

So the confusion is this... some people are treating reaching your set point in recovery as vital in order for recovery to be possible, which is a weight specific to you and your body. But if this is a weight which naturally changes constantly anyway, how are you supposed to know when you've reached it, and how can you possibly overshoot it or go above the weight your body naturally wants to be at? 

I've had it explained as being the weight where you maintain effortlessly and don't think much about food. But (tw numbers) after years of ed and being less than a 14 bmi, my body seems to maintain with no extreme hunger (mentally or physically), good vitals and period in the 17s, but that clearly isn't healthy so I'm still working with my dietician to gain more, even though these same markers would be proof I've reached my set weight if it was in the healthy bmi range. So is there a ""but"" clause attached to this concept? You're at your set weight if xyz (all criteria I seem to meet) BUT only if it's in the arbitrary healthy bmi range?

Idk. Someone just ELI5 please"
Recovery,"Craving fast food  Remember when I said I don't need to stuff myself with junk food in recovery? Well, today I'm craving exactly that. Anything salty or fried. Or a kebab. But we don't have good takeaway kebabs in my area. The city I used to live in had the best ones and a fee months ago we drove all the way there just to eat there again + to get some ice cream from our favorite ice cafe. I kinda want to have both today, but it's at least a 45min drive (which is a lot for German standards, but probably not a lot for Americans). I could risk ordering one here and being disappointed. Hmm..

My mom has been on a health trip lately and she told me how she can't eat junk food anymore because it grosses her out. Yet I want to build a healthy relationship with it again. I don't want to fear it anymore. But that's hard to do when it's so demonized by everyone..."
Recovery,"Tell me your experiences with a dietician pls  I’m hoping to get some experiences that people have had with dieticians, as in are they worth it? I know therapy would be ideal but that’s out of my price range, however I could afford to see a dietician for a few sessions soon. She specialises in eating disorders, I know that’s very important to make sure.

What would a dietician actually do I suppose is my main question and also has anyone found benefit in seeing *only* a dietician for their recovery?"
Recovery,"My stupid recovery hurdle  My original weight loss started last Summer where I started working out, with restricting food intake coming not too soon after. Though stereotypical and vain over that Summer I so desperately wanted to get abs. Looking back I definitely didn't have a massive stomach by any means but my body dysmorphia made it near impossible for me to wear crop tops or bikinis. 

My ED definitely didn't reach its worst until this Winter, where I have now started recovery. I know its such a silly reason to want to postpone my actual recovery but part of me wants to hold off on recovery until its Summer again so at least me finally getting abs could be worth it, yknow? I know deep down that my health is more important than some stupid aesthetics but I can't shake the feeling of all the suffering being for nothing."
Recovery,"My ED has caused issues & it is hard to cope  I now have dental damage/pain/gum infections.

But somehow, I don’t feel sick enough for treatment again."
Recovery,"Extreme hunger after some time  Heey have anyone experienced extreme hunger after a long period of time? I’m in the fifth month of recovery, weight redistributed and got my periods back. These two past days I’ve been having cravings and also feeling extremely hungry and not satisfied after eating anything. How do you cope with this? Should I listen to it?
Thank you for the answers."
Recovery,"A little recovery post  I've been feeling really happy about where I am lately so I just felt like posting this. Also, I know that it can be kinda triggering and negative to scroll through subs like this so I just wanted to add something happy. I started my recovery last February and it was pure hell for a lot of months. There were so many times where I was so sure that I would never get better or live a normal life again, and frankly, I didn't really want to get better. It took a lot of time and effort but man I am so glad I chose to stick to recovery because I cannot describe how much happier I am of a person now. I have so much running around with my friends doing lots of dumb shit and actually enjoying my last summer before I finish high school. There's also so many things that I can do now like bake impulsively and try food shops we randomly run into on the street. The other day my friends and I ran into a new pastry shop at the mall and we decided to get some spontaneously. Last year I would've freaked the hell out but I demolished that thing and it was so good that I would probably sell my soul for another one. The best part is that I actually forgot I even had this unplanned pastry until I got home because I genuinely don't care anymore. This summer was infinitely better than last summer when I was still struggling and I am 100% sure that being recovered had a big part to do with it. You might think that you can still go on living life with an eating disorder but trust me, you are definitely not living to your fullest. I am so glad I recovered because I am only gonna be this young now and to waste it on something like an eating disorder would leave me with regret for my whole life. If you're struggling, I know its hard now but keep at it because I promise it will get a lot better. Your life is so much bigger than an eating disorder bae, that's all :)"
Recovery,"Seeing the doctor tomorrow for the first time in years  I'm just... I'm so nervous. I'm nervous that I'll get lectured. That I won't be believed. That everything will come back normal and I won't have answers. That it turns out that something is horribly wrong with me because of the restriction I did. I have so many fears right now and I want to cry. I know I'm going to have to hear my weight, have my height and blood pressure taken (my heart rate always shoots the hell up when measured so Oh Boy). I'm going to have to look a stranger in the eyes and tell them that I starved myself and that I'm having side effects because of it and the closer I get to tomorrow the more afraid I am."
Recovery,"I got an hernia from throwing up  So I've been recovered for a year now. I already had bad gastritis and the effects of my ed were already showing up. I wasn't able to keep food in my stomach anymore. Constant stomach problems. Medicine wasn't helping so I had to go to the doctor after having severe chest pain while breathing. I wasn't able to move nor eat nor anything without feeling like dying really. 

The doctor checked me, I was honest to him with my bulimia and anorexia. He checked my throat, he pushed something and told me I probably had an hernia bcs of all the vomiting I did for years (I'm talking about +8 years doing so) 

I had an endoscopy and yeah turns out I do have an hernia. Luckily it's fixable with medicine I don't need to have surgery. It still sucks tho. I've been in treatment for 3 months now and I still feel like a I need way more to go cause it's not getting fully better. If I could go back and tell myself to not hurt my body like I did I would.

My mothers ex boyfriend took it when we moved out and she hasn’t replaced it. But I can tell, my face has always been round, and I have a double chin I’m extremely insecure about but it’s gotten worse, I really want to relapse. Just a couple of week, limiting my food intake, just to drop a couple of pounds, until my face is slim and my stomach isn’t so big. I just, I can’t look at myself in the mirror without feeling disgusted. I hate the way my face looks and I want it gone, schools starting tmrw, and I’ll be able to have a distraction making it easier to resist food. 

Not only this but my mom has started to attack me and and my weight lately. Saying she won’t buy me sugar or junk food when we get groceries cause I’m unhealthy, I’m not under or over weight for my height and age I’m on the lower side of the spectrum actually. I do eat normal food, meals. And I work out multiple times a week. But she’s attacking my food intake calling me a pig, saying I’m gross and unhealthy and it’s making me want to relapse so much more.

Recovery,"Ive been in “fake recovery” for a year and now I’m feeling stuck  Background: I was anorexia and bulimic in 2020-2021, quickly developed BED, and started recovery around a year ago. 

When I started recovery, I went “all-in”, but it was definitely fake. I had extreme hunger and “gave in” to my binges but I was still fixated on numbers and choosing safe foods over what I really wanted to eat. Around 4 months after I started recovery, I got into lifting and going to the gym. I stopped calorie counting but I was definitely over exercising and still trying to eat lower calorie foods and high protein. Throughout the year, I’ve been in fake recovery, pushing myself in the gym, mentally counting calories, binging, restricting, weighing myself and honestly developing an obsession with food, exercise, my body, and my self confidence. I wish I could go back and start over with recovery so I could actually do it this time bc I don’t want to be struggling like this. My gut health is TERRIBLE like my digestion and stomach issues are actually unbearable. I’m CONSTANTLY thinking about food or looking at my body or planning my next meal / workout. I’m more than weight restored and my extreme hunger is gone so I just feel like I can’t go all in right now so I’m really frustrated and lost."
Recovery,"I feel like I don't deserve recovery because I'm not that bad...  Exactly what the title says, I've had an ED for 4-5 years, and it's on and off, I ''recover'' (still having disordered thoughts, but not counting calories or weighing myself, starving, etc), then I relapse, and it's a cycle.  


Now, I'm kind of in the middle, it's not that bad, like it used to be, and I feel like genuinely don't deserve recovery, I eat, more than the 800 kcals I was giving myself, I'm not underweight (I'm actually overweight), I used to be worse.

My mind tells me that first, I need to be worse, and then I can actually recover.

Does someone feels the same?"
Recovery,"My history w disordered eating. I can’t even tell if I should be worried about my own habits.  TW: numbers!

This is gonna be a long post probably. I’m just reaching out because I don’t really understand what I’m feeling and I know I can get good perspective here.

So, up until college, I was extremely underweight. Like I don’t think I broke 100lbs until right at the end of high school and I was about 5’6” at the time. People always speculated that I had an ED but I didn’t - or at least I didn’t classify it as one because it’s how I had felt for my whole life. Basically food would just randomly gross me out and I would find it hard to even finish eating things I enjoyed. It drove my family crazy but because I didn’t have any insecurity about my weight and didn’t “think I was fat,” nobody was concerned about me having an ED, including me. It was just like “oh she’s annoying and picky and eats like a bird.” There was a lot of anxiety around food for me because I always felt like people were watching me eat, and I felt TERRIBLE about how thin I was.

When I got to college, I was able to eat a lot more because I had an endless variety of foods available to me, so I could always find something that felt safe and not gross to me. As a result, I gained about 30lb my freshman year. That’s when I started to panic. I never liked being super thin, but it was a huge part of my identity for my entire life up to that point and it freaked me out to lose that, even though that very thing was also a huge point of insecurity for me. So I started working out and got into calorie counting. My life in college was pretty regimented and I was broke, so it was easy for me to schedule out my meals and adhere to my diet of 1300 calories per day. I noticed some anxiety creeping up from time to time over eating “normal” amounts of food but I quickly went back to what was a little bit over my original low weight to about 110 lb. This was still a bit underweight for me but felt comfortable and I more or less stayed on a maintenance autopilot all through college.

Since then, I have gone though a few shitty living/money situations where I didn’t always have as many options or as much control over my food intake, so the tracking took a bit of a backseat. In 2020 I creeped back up to my “high weight” of roughly 125-130 from the beginning of college so I decided to start tracking again. Only now I was a lot older, with a slower metabolism, and I had also just gotten on an SSRI that has made losing the weight difficult.

Since then, despite having near constant anxiety over my body and the fat I’ve accumulated, I haven’t actually lost any weight. I go through periods of working out a lot and tracking heavily but it feels unsustainable and never makes a difference for me. Logically, at ~5’7” and 130lb, I know I’m at a “perfectly healthy” weight by BMI standards but I can’t stand to look at myself. My body feels like a symbol for how I’ve “let myself go” and I hate that I no longer can identify with being “small” the way I once did.

I feel constant anxiety over calories and spend hours in analysis paralysis over workout routines which causes me to somehow try bulking/cutting/weights/cardio at the same time and basically I make no progress because I am afraid to commit to any changes. And despite all of my worrying, I have trouble changing my diet because I feel horrible if I don’t eat and I have a pretty high-stakes that I care a lot about and need to be sharp to do. I spend a lot of time beating myself up for not having the self control I used to and I hate the idea that I’m “stuck” looking like this now.

Only recently has it occurred to me that I’ve struggled with disordered eating even before my initial weight gain in college, just a different kind. I have no idea how to have a normal relationship with food, and I am struggling with how to articulate what I’m dealing with to my therapist. I have a therapist already but we have never talked about body stuff and I feel embarrassed to admit that I struggle with some ED type thinking and obsessive behaviors because it doesn’t even show in my body shape, which is what people in fitness circles apparently call “skinnyfat.”

I don’t know, y’all. I think I just want some confirmation that you all see me and some language for bringing this up to my therapist. I mean, in the long run I want to learn how to be comfortable with having an “average” body but I don’t know that people on Reddit can help me with that.

Literally any insight is welcome. Thanks for reading if you’ve made it this far!"
Recovery,"struggling badly  i’ve been experiencing extreme hunger for the past 3 days and have been doing nothing pretty much all day except eating and laying down, i feel so scared and alone in this, and i’m already noticing a difference in my body which is so triggering. my ED voice is literally SCREAMING at me right now and i really need reassurance that i’m doing the right thing, i really don’t want to relapse"

I have handled it decently but obviously started to feel temped to restrict. I can admit I have had days that I failed but overall I am very proud of myself and how I have recovered from the break up without completely reverting back to my old mindset. With that being said I have mentally been obsessing over my body and appearance. This is very different than I have in the past, as I do not feel critical (all the time) of my body, but just in a constant need to observe how I look, how people see me etc. I want to remain healthy and not fall back into old ways but this almost feels like a gateway drug. Any advice or suggestions appreciated, thx"
Recovery,"Post AN Body dysmorphia ?  Potential TW: In the last couple of weeks I have binge ate so much that I have catapulted myself back to my pre ED weight, after slowly gaining through periods of restriction and over eating the last year, from a low weight to a „healthy medical weight.“

That’s well enough to deal with, but all of the sudden I started to experience an usual amount of negativity towards my body and how „huge“ I look. Obviously I am defiantly not UW anymore. But I am still at an average weight. My AN was never about losing weight to look pretty. I actually hated how skinny I looked when I was at my LW, but now I can not stand the sight of me
In the mirror. Did any of you experience something similar ? Like I never have experienced anxiety by just thinking about going to a swimming pool or something ( I was a swimmer in my youth). But now I can not even stand the thought of anyone seeing me in more than lose and oversized clothing.

But no matter how much my head begs me I can not stop binging. (My head can not comprehend the thought that it still is EH and not straight up binge eating at this point). I even get mild starvation symptoms despite of higher than average calorie amounts the day before (e.g muscle fatigue, dizziness, brain fog). I promise myself to eat normal that day and not shovel Ungodly amount of food into my mouth. But despite physical discomfort, there is always an excuse to just say fuck it at some point and go in full in vacuum mode.

My head is super noisy and annoying right now and my days revolve around the binge-restrict cycle. Which leaves me neither with all the positive things from ED people preach about, like food freedom and basically a life, but also not with the sick twisted endorphins of the ED. 

Sorry for not having anything positive to say really. I just feel so lost and alone. And I am 25 god damn it! I should get my shit together."

Recovery,"Finally another win!  Today we celebrated a coworker's birthday and she brought selfmade cheesecake and a biught strawberry cake. And I had two slices of the cheesecake :) I had one when we were all sitting together. A coworker who wanted to try both cakes cut herself two very thin slices. She halfed one of the slices of cheesecake. While working, I kept thinking about that delicious cheesecake and I had the other half of the slice later in the afternoon. I ate it quickly without giving myself enough time to feel guilty. Ok, I guess I had one slice and a half instead of two, but still. A big win. And I don't regret it because that cheesecake was amazing. I could have eaten the entire cake. I won't be at work tomorrow and I have to admit I'm a bit sad I can't have any of the leftovers :(

I didn't compensate at dinner and still had my normal portion + ice cream for dessert. Though I do admit I planned to eat cake today and didn't pack lunch on purpose. 

I have a habit of stealing sweets at work to eat later at home. It isn't really stealing since the snacks are free for everyone. But it does feel like it. I took a praline and I might eat it later. There were lots of sweets I haven't had in ages and the temptation to eat some was there, but I didn't have the courage because I already ate cake. Baby steps. One day I'll be able to snack freely again without calculating what I already ate and what I'm going to eat later.

Recovery,"I keep eating past fullness and I don't know why  For the past 24 hours I have repeatedly eaten past fullness and its making me feel really unwell (nausea, headaches, fatigue, bloated, and in a bad mood). I don't know what is causing this. My hunger cues have been restored for at least 4-5 months, I'm eating unrestricted, and I haven't planned out my meals **at all** in 4 days (in reference to my last post), so I'm feeling quite frustrated. I typically don't use the term 'binge' because it makes me feel bad about myself (and idek if this is technically binging) but I'm honestly wondering if this might be a binge. Nothing I'm eating is satisfying my brain even though I am eating lots of high calorie food I usually enjoy and I am full. I keep hoping that eating more will make me feel better (less upset, less bored, etc), but instead it makes me feel worse. I feel sick and so ashamed of how I am making my body feel that I just want to be alone. I'm sure this will all pass but it really sucks :("
Recovery,Nervous about school  Last year I was really sick and I had to leave school in May because I was inpatient for 2 months. Now that I’m better physically I’m scared of what teachers and students will think. Im scared of being seen as fat. I have so much anxiety about people seeing me. High school kids are so judgemental and I hate crowds.
Recovery,"you aren’t alone!  i just had a 200g block of cheese, a giant chocolate bar, two pieces of bread, tons of salami, a lot of pickles, three yogurt cups, a bread roll, three apples and a bowl of cereal on top of everything else ive had today (its currently 1am). i havent experienced extreme hunger in a week now, but it came today anddd we dont restrict over here so i honored it! now, im gonna go to bed satisfied and will be able to actually sleep - instead of staying up till 5am due to hunger… eventually giving into it regardless. and i’ll move on and continue eating as much as my body asks for tomorrow! my body asked for this food for a reason, so im not gonna compensate for it. if youre going through extreme hunger - im proud of u for fueling your body and doing the right thing! remember, we’re in this together <3"
Recovery,"Warm milk with honey  I have nowhere else to share this; but warm milk with honey? It's a godsend, soooooo fricking good. I made it because my throat hurts, and it has a really soothing effect along with tasting phenomenal.

Me a year ago would NEVER add more calories to already liquid calories, but it just hits different."
Recovery,"Intuitive eating and body awareness  I’m coming up on a year of recovery and these past 3 months have been a total shift in my experience with my body and food. I feel like I’m entering into a more intuitive eating stage of living and it’s been both gratifying and surprising. I thought it might be helpful to share some of the observations I’ve made about my own relationship with my body, food, and movement as my brain shifts towards a more intuitive, healthy state of being. Disclaimer: I’m coming from a state of severe malnourishment as a result of restrictive AN. 
- I’m learning exactly what my food preferences are. It’s easy when you have an ED to convince yourself “I don’t like XYZ food” to protect the disorder. It’s been a fun experience to try new things and actually discover what I enjoy eating vs what I pretended to enjoy.
- My body responds best to a diet that is high protein, high fiber, and high in healthy fats. It’s especially important that I eat a breakfast that’s high in fat and protein; I noticed that if I don’t, I’m more likely to experience an uncomfortable blood sugar crash in the later portion of the day (regardless of how many *calories* I consumed). RIP oats for breakfast but you just don’t do it for me.
- Continuing on the healthy fats train, I’ve learned I actually really like nuts! Huge fear food turned favorite quick snack lol
- I genuinely enjoy being physically active, but I’m more likely to allow myself to rest as well. If I force physical activity on myself I end up feeling awful for the rest of the day. I can trust that I won’t “sit around” for days on end, but I’m at least comfortable with sitting around when my body asks for it. 
- Because I’m giving myself adequate fuel, I can actually be physically active for longer! Go endurance 💪🏻 
- I tend to be hungrier the day *after* being heavily active than the day of. Chalk it up to my body needing extra energy to heal.
- my extreme hunger has waned pretty noticeably. I’m not spending all day thinking about food and wanting to eat. I still get what I affectionately call “hungry days” but those are much fewer and farther between. This leads me to believe I’m approaching my set point. 
- Listening to and understanding cravings has gotten much easier. I’m able to stop and actually *hear* what my body is asking for. I’ve also taken a gentle nutrition approach; if I know a craving isn’t going to keep me satiated for very long/a meal is missing a key macronutrient, I’m comfortable with *adding* to that thing to make it more complete. 
- I still don’t like my body very much! Who’s surprised lmao. BUT it’s much easier for me to push that discomfort away from my focus and move on with my day. Body hatred is more of an intrusive thought process now than it is a fixation. 
- Still genuinely like black coffee and green tea
- I sleep so much better these days and my vivid dreams are back!

I could probably keep going but I think y’all get the idea. You never know how your relationship with food and your body can improve until you give it a fair shot. I’m not gonna pretend that I don’t still struggle with my ED because I do, it can be really hard and tempting to go back. I’ve been pleasantly surprised by all the ways my life has improved though; you never know what you’re missing until you get it BACK."
Recovery,"Sickness during extreme hunger  So the other day, I decided to say fuck it to quasi-recovery and go all in. Basically, the past 2 days i've been nonstop eating junk foods/foods very high in sugar, and yesterday i ate a very large amount of sugar, and ended up feeling so sick, i was unable to move. I called my mom and grandma and asked them to take me to the doctor, because i thought i was going to have a heart attack. I ended up getting sick and i felt a lot better after (note: i did NOT purposefully upchuck) but since then, i've continued eating lots of high sugar foods and i'm so afraid that this will happen again. I'm trying to honor every bit of hunger that I have, physical and mental, but I also don't want to literally die of a sugar coma. Has anyone else experienced this?"
Recovery,"Holiday in Berlin - Need help please  Hi everyone, I hope you're all doing okay. 

So I'm on holiday in Berlin and the amount of food here that looks so delicious is rediculous. There's so mich that I'd love to try while I'm here, but unfortunately they also happen to be my fear foods. Foods like chocolate, cakes, ice-cream, pastries, some breads (including pretzels) and all the other classic German foods that you'd think you'd try while here are all insanely triggering for me and I'm scared that if have any, I'll gain weight and or purge afterwards and have a panic attack. 

How have you all dealth with wanted to try new foods that are unsafe? Especially when you're on holiday so you have all these unique opportunities and foods/drinks to try. 

Edited to mention that I have history with anorexia, bulimia and orthorexia. I've been in recovery for feels like ages because my behaviours are outwardly neemed as 'healthy' (such as exercise additional, orthorexic behaviour, and restriction). Just thought I'd add this in case some context was important as all. 

Thank you all 😊"
Recovery,Bagels  Avoided bagels like the plague during my eating disorder. They were one of my favorite childhood foods. I recently challenged this fear and now I want one every day. I picked up 6 bagels this morning and am so excited about having them whenever I want this week! There’s nothing scary about bagels and so much to celebrate about them. Just wanted to share a moment of appreciation for bagels and recovery progress ❤️🥯
Recovery,"Milk chocolate toblerone? Dark chocolate toblerone? White chocolate toblerone? All of them at once, I suppose.  For my Saturday candy-snack I wanted salty licorice and hot cocoa, so I consumed it and it was delicious. But I also wanted toblerone, but didn't know what flavor I wanted! I had both milk chocolate, dark chocolate and white chocolate toblerones. So what did I do? I took a piece of each (two pieces of white chocolate because I accidentally broke off two instead of one). So a 100g bag of salty licorice, a cup of real hot cocoa, and four large toblerone pieces of various flavor was my evening snack.

It was divine! I'm glad I didn't have to choose between flavors, because both milk, dark and white chocolate were delicious in their own way c:

I'm writing this the day after, and I kind of want a lot of chocolate today too... also ice cream"
Disordered,"Weight gain + insatiable cravings for sweets in recovery  Hi. First time poster, been struggling with ED as long as I can remember. I’ve been in recovery for about two years, though I relapsed over the summer. I recently caught novovirus and as a result was horrifically ill and unable to eat due to stomach cramping- was dehydrated enough I ended up on an IV. Having recovered from the virus, I find I cannot stop eating. I’ve had desserts every day, often multiple times a day. It almost feels like binging, except I’m genuinely starving at all times, regardless of what I’ve eaten. Because I’m not UW, my ED is in panic mode about my weight gain. Wondering if anyone has tips on how to maintain my recovery and keep myself from relapsing."
Disordered,"The honeymoon phase of recovery is wearing off  I am on day 16 all-in. The past couple days I have really been struggling… today was probably the worst day yet. Although all in was very terrifying and uncomfortable at first, I would be lying if I said it wasn’t exciting and somewhat enjoyable at the same time. Now the novelty of food freedom has worn off and I’ve been left with extreme hunger, physical discomfort, and what looks and feels like a completely different body. I haven’t weighed myself, but I seriously look like I’ve gained >!20!< pounds in a matter of a couple weeks. I only have 2 outfits that I feel comfortable wearing outside the house, but the thought of clothes shopping sounds like an actual nightmare. And most of the time I can’t even have sex with my boyfriend without getting triggered and upset because I just feel so awkward and uncomfortable with my body. Today is the first day where I know I have been mentally restricting. I still ate twice today (decent portion sizes and calorie dense food) but I did not have any snacks and now I feel like I shouldn’t eat dinner because I drank more than I had planned today (which happened because of my terrible body image along with getting into a quickly resolved but intense argument with my boyfriend that stemmed from the fact that he is still hurt by the fact that I prioritized anorexia over him for so long). I will not give up considering that I have already made so much progress… But I’m just so exhausted from fighting my mind day in and day out, and I feel like the reality of recovery (especially the weight gain aspect) is just starting to fully hit me now."
Recovery,not having to choose  one fun thing about recovery is that if i want to have two different things i can just have both of them. like just now i was hungry and i was like im gonna have either popcorn or skyr with peanut butter as a little snack before bed and than i realized wait i don’t have to decide. so i got my little bowl of popcorn and enjoyed it and than i had my bowl of skyr and also enjoyed it. Idk i feel like when i was restricting i created this scarcity mindset where i could only have /one/ thing and now it’s like you want both why not.
Recovery,"Dae have family that just causally say things like “oh I’ve been so good I only ate this today” like stfu I don’t wanna hear that type of stuff constantly :(  Just stuff that does not need to be said

“I’m losing weight lately I’m at xx“ 

 It does my head in both my parents say this type of shit constantly, go on about type of foods and that just things that don’t need to be said. Like I don’t care if you weigh less than me stop talking about it."
Recovery,"proud of myself tonight  so i’ve just come home from a friend’s house where i spent the afternoon and evening with him and two other friends celebrating his birthday by going paddle-boarding and returning to his for pizza and cakes. and it was wonderful. i didn’t restrict at all - i had a brownie on the way back from paddle-boarding, ordered a hawaiian pizza from dominos, had a slice of cake for pudding and then had another brownie just because i felt like it! my friend made the brownies himself, they were so good. might ask him for the recipe. just feeling really happy and optimistic after this. sending hugs to everyone reading this - keep fighting!"
Recovery,"How to deal with fullness  Been in recovery for 3 months and I still have extreme hunger. I enjoy eating and food now (yay!!) but the aftermath isn’t good.

Recovery,"I don't want to relapse  TW: ED BEHAVIOR

First time poster here, pls bare with me.

I struggled from anorexia and restriction basically my whole life. This summer I decided to start recovery. It went pretty well I guess.

A few weeks ago i broke my ankle, so I cant move as much as I'd like to. I'm spiralling. Tonight I purged for the very first time and honestly I'm scared. I'm scared that I will make this a habit to compensate the lack of sports. I'm scared that this circle is about to start again.

I really dont want to relapse. I want to free myself from this disorder.

Could someone tell me it gets better? Are there any harm reduction tipps I could follow?

Hope you all stay strong!
Thank you ❤️"
Recovery,"Intense emotions during recovery  Title says it all. I’m “recovering” on my own, doing all-in, post history explains the whole story, I’ve stopped counting calories and I’m trying to wean off of weighing myself as well (although this one is a lot harder). I notice that a lot of the things that only mildly upset me over the summer (which was when I was restricting) are really starting to hit me intensely now. Like in general I was kind of depressed about having to do classes online during the first part of the year, I had to leave the program because I failed a few classes, I was going to start a new program in the fall but during the summer I missed a payment and lost my spot (due to ED brain fog) and my parents are of the opinion that I should just lay low and try to recover for the year anyways… and I don’t know I’m just a bit down about not being able to go to school. Like “crying every day” levels of down. Sometimes completely unprompted. I just get hit with these waves of sadness because I feel like I haven’t done anything over the summer or I feel like I haven’t gotten anything productive done at all this year. I guess if anything the fact that I’ve lost so much to my ED even though my relapse was relatively short lived is great motivation to never let anything like this happen ever again and to recover but fuck I hate just being so sad all of the time."
Recovery,"recovery questions! (tw: calories, weight, mindset etc)  hello! i’m looking to recover and just have some questions i was hoping some people could answer. tw as per title, ive tried to censor numbers etc but im on mobile so unsure if it’ll work :)

some background: i feel like im in a weird situation where i have a physical ed but not with the mental desire to lose weight. basically, i lost a lot of weight unintentionally due to some health issues, and then started restricting as a way to maintain that weight (no idea why my brain thought that was how it would work when i could just keep eating as i was but anyway) because it was toward the higher end of UW >!18 ish!< and i was still physically healthy (had my period etc). then, probably as a result of the health issues and the restriction, i lost more weight, which was not what i wanted, and have actually been trying/mentally wanting to gain weight but somehow still restrict ??? idk ed brain, it’s weird. my weight when i started the restriction was >!53kg (172cm, 19f, bmi 18~)!< toward the end of last year, now i’m >!45kg (same height, 20f, bmi 15~)!< . anyway onto the questions!

1. i had been high restricting >!(1200ish cals)!< . how much do i need to be eating to realistically weight restore? i’ve been eating between >!1500 (not a lot, i know)-3000!< depending on the day for the last like 3 weeks and have only gained like >!0.5kg!< from my lw :(

2. on that note, i am a poor student. i’ve been at home for the last three weeks for college break so extreme hunger/cravings have been easy to honour, but when i go back to college it will be a lot harder because i simply can’t afford to buy that much food, i also don’t even know how i’m going to afford three meals/three snacks kinda thing. has anyone tried to recover when poor? bear in mind i have been prescribed a weight gain supplement so that helps

3. how do i deal with weight gain and self perception? i feel like i’m in a vicious cycle of looking in the mirror and being like wtf i look fine lol i don’t even need to gain weight and then looking in a different mirror/a photo of myself and being like WOWWWW i am skeletal and gross i need to get my weight up ?! i’m trying to hold myself accountable because i have this one bodycheck photo where i look particularly sickly and gross and i look at that whenever my brain tells me i don’t need to gain weight but how do i deal with this mindset in general?

4. HOW DO I STOP COUNTING CALS !!!!! i swear i have literally everything memorised, i don’t weigh my food anymore but i still measure it when i can but would like to stop. does anyone have any tips for figuring out normal portion sizes of things without regard to calories? especially since i buy and cook most of my own food. how do i know how many potatoes is a normal amount of potatoes instead of my set knowledge of what 150cal of potatoes looks like?!?!
4.2. on that note how do i stop counting cals and still eat enough? i’ve noticed that on the days where i’ve only eaten >!1500!< calories that’s me intuitively eating like how do i make sure i’m getting enough in if i’m not counting?

5. like i said, before i started restricting, i was toward the higher end of uw. i don’t really care about overshoot, but, if that was where my body was when i was eating intuitively, will my body still be able to repair damage if i end up restored to low healthy bmi/high underweight?

6. bloating….. any tips? 

7. how often should i weigh myself? i’m sorta used to doing it every day or every second day, how often would you guys recommend considering i’m in mostly self recovery? (as in i will be seeing a dietician soon but i’m not in any sort of inpatient or outpatient programme)

thanks guys! love this sub it’s so positive hopefully this is allowed idk i just want help

Recovery,"I'm on the verge of a relapse  TW: mention of BMI

I've been in recovery for about a month and a half now, and things were really going well! The problem is that the little everyday annoyances (quick thoughts of ""oh god x part of my body is literally so fat"" and stuff like that) have accumulated and I feel an uncontrollable urge to restrict again and count calories.

I'm in a healthy BMI, and while I know all the bullshit behind this thing, I can't help but think ""well, if I'm healthy, it won't do as much damage to restrict!""

I don't want to go back to being obsessed with food, being hungry and weak all the time and having to convince my parents and friends that I'm okay. My head has put me on a sort of 50/50: either I restrict and I'm ""clean"", or I eat normally and I'm disgusting.

It's weird, because my eating disorder doesn't necessarily come from a preoccupation with beauty, but the feeling that if there's fat in my body, I can feel it and I feel gross. It's getting skinny for the sake of being skinny."

well she is the only thing that makes me not okay with it. she makes comments about how shes skinny, how shes slim thick, has an ass, etc. She touches my stomach everyday even when I tell her not to.

I feel like I'm unnecessarily mean to her because just seeing her pisses me off. how she can go all day without eating and no one says anything but everyone is always on me just because of what I went through publicly when she is going through it quietly. she is my little sister and I want to love her but holy fuck I cant stand being around her sometimes and I know it all comes from my own insecurity.

Recovery,"Wheeeeeee! Along for the ride.  
Hi everyone! I hope you all are doing very well :-) 

I just wanted to make this post for… I don’t actually know ha ha… Support? Reassurance? Someone to tell me to get my shit together?

Long story kind of short, I moved across the country today, haven’t slept in nearly 48 hours, and have managed to consume more food than I ever have in a day before, and it is stressing me right out. I know objectively that I am underweight And that quite frankly, there is no too much food. Guilt is just so strong though – almost unbearable I also feel very physically unwell, and that makes me really wonder if I should continue to listen to it. Part of me is genuinely excited to be giving myself this permission to finally eat whatever it is my mind is asking for, And it feels good in the moment, but afterwords I just got obliterated by my ED brain. 

I ate a big bowl of cereal, a huge fruit salad, like half of a jar of peanut butter in the form of spoonfuls and on TWO huge and delicious white buns as PB and banana sandwiches, a bunch of handfuls of granola and cereal, a big spanking bowl of oatmeal drenched in PB And maple syrup and lots of fruit, nearly half a homemade peach pie, and now I’m planning to eat my usual dinner that has lots of veg, squash, and fruit, but I am also going to have the pint of chocolate fudge Ben and Jerry’s and more pie. Honestly, the food was so freaking good and I enjoyed every bite, it it just feels like so much more than I’m used to and I feel so not like myself. 

I’ve also been absolutely and utterly exhausted all day. Have barely moved, my muscles are just aching, and I fell asleep on the floor for two hours lol!!

My mind is full on beating me up and saying that this wasn’t EH, it was emotional/binge eating because I literally have not slept in 2 days and I’m having a Major life change at the moment. Healthy brain can see that even if this were the case, that’s such good reason to eat. Objectively, I know this isn’t bingeing. I guess maybe I’m just anxious and scared of change and want someone to tell me it’s okay to do what I did aha and I want to hear if anyone has been through similar things with major life changes/stress? 

I feel like if I was a “true” anorexic, stress should have triggered me to not eat. In the past, it would have, but something has switched and I truly am being dragged along by this recovery thing haha..doesn’t fully feel like a choice, but my body says  it is god damn for sure happening lol!

Thank you for reading my rant and I’m wishing you all so much love"
Recovery,"Cereal  Please tell me I'm not alone on this. I am weight-restored and still battling positive mentality of it. I do not exercise and I am still just not motivated to get a job yet.  I'm 32 years old...just ate an entire box of Cap'n Crunch cereal 18oz box AND a whole box 16oz of Fruit Loops.

Please any adults still eat this sugary heaven?  I feel so guilty and disgusted.  Any support is appreciated.  I'm proud I kept eating it though because it was delicious, but just feel so guilty and like I am overstepping my boundaries.

Recovery,"Does anyone else feel like they lack support?  I have a group of friends that I adore, who also have mental health issues, and know I have my own fair share of struggles. And whenever they text me asking for support, I immediately respond with words of support, cute pics of my dog, or funny memes. My meme folder for such occasions is massive. I’m happy to support and love being a safe person for them. 

But the last two weeks I’ve been struggling a lot with burn out, depression, and urges. I’ve reached out to all of my friends at varying points and have heard nothing back. I know we’re all doing the best we can but it’s hard sometimes to feel like when I need a mood booster, I don’t get one back. It hurts and since I’m still in the midst of a heavy depressive episode, it’s contributing to me wanting to self isolate."
Recovery,"Living with roommates, coping with others’ eating habits  Hi, looking for any advice/experience you guys can share about living with roommates when in recovery. I just started my second year of college and i moved into an apartment with 2 other students and of course my ED is making me monitor their eating habits like they’re my own. One, the male, eats like a “normal” college student (mac&cheese, frozen pizza, pasta, etc) whereas the other (female) is super “healthy” and only eats protein/vegetables since she is into fitness and weightlifting and says she has to eat low carb for the best gains (? Idk how any of that stuff works but whatever).

It’s tough seeing her go to the gym and look super toned, and say she doesn’t eat sugar/sweets and only likes to eat healthy. I know everyone has different needs and not everyone is ruled by obsessive thoughts around food like me, so i try to remind myself of that but it’s still hard. Any tips for living with new people of the same age who have different diets than your ideal one?"
Recovery,Um it feels like I have baby skin  So like idk wtfs going on but my skin feels super smooth now. Like it’s been dry and flaky and after I shower a bunch like comes off and I’m not really in recovery but once all that dry skin comes off now my arms and legs and stuff feel really smooth anyone else have this happen
Recovery,"progress :)  It's been a bit over 2 months since I started recovering and I just wanted to share, in case it could inspire anyone, how great I've been feeling lately. I'm bursting with energy, I'm so excited about life, I feel like I want to socialize again, and holy crap..... I really am not thinking about food anymore unless it's my meal or snack time. 

So for anyone doubting if recovery is worth it.... 100%. Just the fact that I'm able to be present, laugh every day and feel so relaxed makes me so grateful that I chose to change things, and I wish the same for all of you guys. 

The road ahead is still long but we got this."
Recovery,How to avoid / handle people mentioning my weight gain?  I'm going back to university soon and people haven't seen me in 3 months. I gained quite some weight and went up a looot of sizes in clothing so weight gain is hardly to hide. Plus I'm in overshoot of EH and probably still gaining. The weight is still a huge trigger for me and I can't handle the thought of anyone mentioning how much my appearance changed in such a short time. I don't mind explaining my ED to close friends but not to those people I barely know but still think it's okay to comment on my body.

i just did my first week of only 1700 cals/day which i more or less did, and i gained 2 pounds which seems like a LOT for 1 week of only eating 1700 (i did not exercise or run but still was fairly active, walking several miles/day

is this weight gain normal? Is it also food weight/water? please i need some science and support to alleviate my anxiety

thanks"
Recovery,"I haven’t weighed myself in nearly 3 months!  As the title says, I’ve nearly reached 3 months since I’ve weighed myself. I used to weigh myself, collect my measurements and calculate everything once a week.

Now I’m trying really hard to get better, avoiding posts on here (because I know I’ll be tempted to trigger myself), avoiding people irl who make comments abt food and eating disorders, scrolling past “low-cal” recipes.

It’s hard, really hard, but I’m happier and have more energy."
Disordered,"recovery minimum- tw bmi mention no numbers  so according to the minimums i should be eating 3000 each day.

i have some questions.

if i continue to eat 3000 like i'm supposed to, will my body eventually adjust and stop gaining?

if so, why am i still rapidly gaining weight at an almost obese bmi (i was underweight bmi. its bullshit i know but its better than numbers) after 4 months of eating over 3000?

i don't understand any of this. i'm just so over it tbh."
Disordered,"Mom drives me insane  So, we prepared tomato soup with the tomatoes from our garden for dinner today. My ED was very happy with this. ""Great, a low cal dinner!""
But my mom just told me she's been thinking about making pancakes afterwards because she thinks just soup with bread won't be filling enough. And my mind went crazy. ""You can't have pancakes, you already had two breakfasts and a sandwich for lunch even though you weren't hungry"". ""Today was supposed to be a light day, you haven't been active at all""

So many reasons why I ""can't have pancakes"".

I love pancakes. I want to enjoy them. Think of it as dessert after dinner. But my ED has been so mean.

I'm off work today and coincidentally woke up sick with a cold. I would have had to stay home either way. And my mom currently has to stay home as well because she broke her foot.
I ate a yoghurt bowl with raspberries, apple and granola before she woke up. Then, once she was up, we boiled some eggs. Two for each, along with a slice of buttered bread. But she only ate one egg and half a slice of bread. I was already at my second egg and had already eaten half of my bread. I felt guilty when she stopped eating. It made me so mad. She never finishes her food. I try to make her finish, but she just gives it to the dogs. 
I left my other half of the bread out of protest.

Later, when we started preparing the soup, I also got an apple out of our garden. I wanted to make apple pie, but she told me the apples weren't ripe enough, so I didn't. I still cut up the one I got earlier and it was ripe. I offered her a slice. At first she didn't want to eat it and looked at me with disgust. She always does when I offer her food. But then she sighed and took it. She bit into it and immediately spat it out. It was too ""mealy"" for her. Ffs, it's just a slice of apple, can't you at least finish that? She's so picky for no reason. She wasn't always like this. I feel like it started when she found out about my ED. And it's so triggering.

My mom is trying to lose weight. And she's been eating less and less. I can't stand it. She doesn't even think about how horrible it makes me feel. She looked into supplements today. She wants to do a detox. I told her that she doesn't need those unnecessarily overpriced supplements. All the nutrients she needs are in food. She just needs to eat. But she prefers to smoke her cigarettes and drink her coke and coffee instead of eating.

Honestly, her eating is so disordered. But every time I tell her, she replies with ""I've got enough fat to lose, mind your own business""

I can't take it anymore..."
Disordered,"still waking up to eat at night/in sleep  i'm 4 months into recovery today and still ate a cheesestring and 2 cookies ""in my sleep"" last night. i used to eat multiple pieces of bread with nutella so it has lessened but why is this still happening to me if i don't have extreme hunger and i'm eating enough AND i'm weight restored??

Disordered,"All-in and gaining weight FAST  TRIGGER WARNING: MENTION OF WEIGHT GAIN + NUMBERS (please don't read on if weight numbers trigger you but I'm just looking for help myself)

Hello! I've gone all-in for about 2 weeks and am struggling a lot mentally. 



When I got weighed by my doctor in May she told me that I was at around 39 kg (I'm around 160-161 cm btw). While on vacation however I'm sure that I lost a lot more weight because of a bad relapse.
My body was getting worse very fast and everyone was scared that I wouldn't survive any longer. 
One day howevery (around the 18th of august) my mind completely clicked and my extreme hunger kicked in. That's when I decided to go all-in. 
I'm now honoring most of my physical and mental hunger but the extremely rapid weight gain is killing me inside. 
I'm at around 45-46 kg now and I think that i gained around 4 kg in just one week. Is that even normal or healthy? I'm so scared because I'm eating SO SO MUCH and rarely feel full. 
I can't see even look at myself in the mirror without crying and am struggling so much mentally and physically.
I feel like no one, even other people with EH, is eating as much as me..."
Disordered,"Engaging in recovery!!  I'm 16 and I'm tired of wasting my life on food, couting calories, feeling cold and tired, making everyone worried... you name it.
I don't have a diagnostic for anything but I want to get better.
Can I have any advices please ? Thank you and good luck to everyone ❤"
Disordered,Again very worried for my health  
Disordered,"Stupid Dr's office told me my weight  Ugh... I haven't weighed myself in over SEVEN YEARS. I knew I had gained some weight. I've been doing weight training and generally become much stronger and more athletic since the last time I weighed myself. Now I can exercise because it's fun and I like to challenge myself, it's no longer a punishment for eating. My body has changed a lot as a result though.

It's a new Dr. and I specifically told them I needed to face backwards on the scale and I didn't want to know my weight.  But the printout they gave me with follow up care had it in BOLD. What the shit?! Very careless on their part. 

I'm fucking angry right now. It's sending me into a tailspin and I'm freaking out over seeing the highest number I've ever seen associated with my weight. 

I was doing really well. Seven years without any disordered eating behaviors, and honestly feeling not great but okay about my body. I just can't believe how much I weigh. I am technically overweight by about ten pounds but what fucking ever. I'm not going to hurt myself to lose ten pounds. None of my physicians has said I need to lose weight for medical reasons.

I hate that my ED was right there under the surface waiting at this chance to rear its ugly head. And I'm just flooded with the negative self talk. 

I know losing weight doesn't cure negative body image. I don't want to do any stupid shit to lose this 11 pounds I've gained. 

But fuck this! Fuck everything about this. I'm trying to let this be a small battle I'm losing, and that tomorrow is another day and this doesn't mean I'm losing the war. 

So fuck you, ED. You made me scared and cry today, but I'm so much fucking stronger than I was seven years ago. This version of me can run ten miles in the woods, at my current weight. I couldn't do that last time I was being held down by this stupid disease, even though I weighed less. So fucking come at me, ED!! This is a small slip, but it is not a relapse and I will not harm myself to get skinny. I will not. And I will absolutely not let you take running away from me. This will not become something I do to burn calories or lose weight. This will continue to be something I do to bring me joy. You can't have this, ED. 

I will love myself. And I will be grateful for the things my body can do, regardless of how it looks or its relationship to Earth's gravity. That's all this number is. 

But also: uuuurrrrggghhhrrhdyegyxhdiksjdehzz!!!"
Disordered,"HAE had experience with low-phosphate levels (hypophosphatemia) with Overshoot?  Hi everyone... apologies for the long post.   
**TL;DR: I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced hypophosphatemia well into their recovery. And I'm working through anxiety and confusion over eating more and weighing more, but my phosphorus levels somehow being lower than they were when I entered treatment.**   


Just processing how the last few months have been. I've made it to week 46 of all in recovery.  
Some victories have included not obsessing over my weight even when the nurse who did my weigh in forgot to do it blind and said the number out loud, some light spotting for a day last month after not having a period since 5/2021, and not worrying over taking a break from yoga.   


What's puzzling to me is at the time that I entered PHP, my phosphorus levels were normal. And even before deciding to commit to treatment and recovery, my labs have come back normal. But in March, they were slightly low (2.4 mg/dL). And then in July they got even lower (1.9 mg/dL).   
I had started feeling more depression and fatigue around April and May and for the better part of July I just constantly needed more sleep, and I took a break from yoga because my muscles just were shakey despite having had a consistent practice since January.   


I mentioned it to my dietician in March and she just said to take a supplement or eat more phosphorus rich foods. I've been on a multi-vitamin and eating more yogurt, chicken, and leafy greens since.   
Trying to do research has been somewhat frustrating because everything I find on hypophosphatemia says that it's caused by malnourishment, starvation, and anorexia, or in very rare cases genetics. And I am in recovery from anorexia.    


Some articles say it's a very common symptom of re-feeding syndrome to have low phosphorus levels. Something about the body needing more phosphorus to convert carbs into energy, but starvation and malnourishment means depleting those levels. What's confusing to me is that my phosphorus levels were normal when I entered PHP treatment in October, and seemed to have lowered after I had stepped down from IOP in December.  My re-feeding process had more bloating, fatigue, and constipation the first 4 weeks of PHP. How is it possible that I've been eating more but still have this deficiency, even after the point when re-feeding syndrome makes sense?   
I've been eating consistently and am at the point of being able to eat according to hunger. I don't know if I'm fully weight restored because I overshot in March and am still gaining, which I think means my body is still trying to settle on a set point? I've overshot by >!at least 40 lbs. !< Is it still re-feeding syndrome even after I have had consistent eating and honoring of EH? 

My doctor is concerned that something's going on with my kidneys so I'm doing some labs and following up with a nephrologist. I guess it's just counter to what I expected -- that this body would be healthier than the body I had when I was engaging in restricting behaviors. And the reality is my eating disorder has been around for 21 years, and I'm only 10 and a half months into all-in recovery.   


When I mentioned my low phosphorus levels in my last dietician appointment, all she said was to follow up with my doctor. But like -- she never once mentioned that low-phosphorus could happen as part of re-feeding syndrome.   


I'm feeling anxious and just... guilty about how much damage I've done to my body and am now worried that I've done irreparable harm to my kidneys..."
Recovery,"ate TWO pieces of pizza  i know that it isn’t that much (i also had a mini cupcake with LOTS of Betty Crocker frosting heaped onto it) but it was literally all that we had left in the box… i was gonna just have one but i decided that 1. im hungry and one slice sometimes isn’t gonna cut it 2. no point leaving the box in the fridge with a single slice in it and we’re already running kinda low on fridge space 3. the voice in my head telling me to only have one piece of pizza does not have my best interests in mind 4. it’s not gonna keep as well three days after being ordered vs two days may as well enjoy it when it’s at peak reheated pizza freshness. honestly would have had a third if there was more left in the box but we have a shit ton more cupcakes because i have been baking up a storm as of late. 

i also challenged a fear food today - for lunch i had a veggie chicken burger ON A REAL BUN (well technically a kaiser roll because it was cheaper at the store but i mean it’s basically the same thing) and i had FRENCH FRIES with it! and a leftover baked oat muffin from breakfast which i slapped some icing and sprinkles on because i felt like going “cupcake mode”. 

speaking of breakfast i had a croissant with it (also had a baked oat muffin and a little english muffin half sandwich) - not quite as much of a fear food as fries but still kinda scary, it was pretty good tho. i’m still kind of weary around sugar (especially with candy, i’m still mostly getting sugar free stuff.) but when it comes to bread and bread stuffs i love carbs so goddamn muchhhh"

Recovery,Struggling  So first off my jeans… and i mean all of them are starting to fit snug. My ed thoughts are really load and i want to restrict. i have to chance to for a month since i don’t see my doctor for a month. another issue is that i’m always bloated. not so much uncomfortable but very inconvenient. homecoming is coming up and with my jeans starting to fit snug my ed voice is so loud and i don’t know what to do. on top of that i think im going through EH and i just want to cry. Any advice?
Recovery,"Pressured to eat by coworkers  Today a coworker who recently had her second child visited with her 2 month old son. We all celebrated in our break. She brought sandwiches from a bakery, some with ham, some with cheese, some with egg. A wild mix. We also had other snacks, like a box of chocolate one of our patients gifted us. And we had a huge bowl of apples the mother of our boss brought from her garden, as well as some grapes.

I ate a bigger breakfast than expected. I ate the lunch I packed for breakfast (once again) and I felt bad about it. 
My lunch break started a bit before we celebrated our coworker and I ate one of the apples. When I saw all that food, I was a bit overwhelmed. When we all sat down together, two coworkers immediately got up to grab a sandwich. The others talked a bit first. My break was almost over at this point and I didn't want to stay longer than my break. When I got up, the two who ate first asked if I was gonna eat a sandwich and I said ""Later"". They replied that they were gonna check up on me to see if I really did eat something. It made me want to eat even less. 

I hate being pressured to eat. And eating in big groups stresses me out a lot.

My coworkers kept chatting and eating while I went back to work. I kept coming back in to tell my boss something and I felt watched by this one coworker every time. 

I like her a lot. She's very motherly towards me. And she knows about my ED. Everyone at work does. They keep trying to make me eat, but I just want to choose for myself. I do eat. I just need to be left alone.

This coworker has a daughter who's only recently left residential treatment. She's been struggling with an ED for so long that she hasn't been home in years. And it's affected my coworker a lot. I don't know anything beyond that though. It must be hard for her to be around me. I feel guilty. I'm not trying to hurt her, but I feel like I am. Just by being around her... I do want to get better. But it's not anyone's business but mine. They keep pushing. But it's not helping me in any way.

I did end up eating a sandwich when everyone got back to work. I also kept snacking on grapes throughout the day and I had a piece of chocolate while talking to a coworker. I feel more comfortable eating around her because she's never been pushy in any way. She's never said anything to me, which I really appreciate.

I've never talked about my ED at work. My mom told some of them and I bet they talk about it behind my back. They don't know that I know. It's just become this unspoken thing. I don't think I'll talk about it until I've recovered. Maybe not even then. I just want to get this over with and be normal. It's just hard to feel normal when I'm being treated differently."
Recovery,"i ate a fear food  cupcake a coworker brought for us today :p i’d already eaten a BIG breakfast so i wasn’t going to but then i thought fuck it, i need to gain weight. ive spent the past three hours freaking out and keep looking at calorie info online and each website says smth different. i guess the fear i feel is why i needed to do it in the first place!!"
Recovery,Loneliness during extreme hunger  I’ve found myself staying at home everyday recently since starting to honor the extreme hunger because the bloating is so uncomfortable and I get so tired.

For anyone who has gone through a period of loneliness during extreme hunger what are some things you did to distract yourself? Thanks

Recovery,Chasing the feeling of fullness / being satiated  I get it - hunger & fullness cues are completely out of whack during recovery but it sucks…I feel like I am chasing the feeling of fullness and hence eat a lot of food because I will rarely feel full with “normal” portions / single servings / cue in x amount of food. It drives me crazy…any ideas what I could do or when fullness cues tend to stabilize?

Disordered,"Dealing with a relapse…  TW talking about relapsing, no specifics though.

I haven’t posted on here in a while, and to be honest I think I’ve actually been hiding from my account because I feel ashamed. I don’t think I wanted to admit it but I’m here now and I have to say I have definitely relapsed & relapsed hard… so now I just don’t know what to do. 

Recovery itself was actually going well for me, (as well as recovery can go), my eh settled down and the thoughts were getting less and less. So I don’t know whether I feel surprised right now or maybe I was just in denial? My mom has always equated my weight to how pretty I am/my worth, she did not like me gaining weight and her comments on my eating habits have been getting more frequent lately. There’s no worse feeling than being excited about food (finally!) and being told ‘OP you’re eating so much’/‘Are you sure you’re gonna finish all that?’ or something along those lines. This led to a really bad two week relapse that I’m only just sort of coming out of. And Idk… I’m not sure what my intention is here but I think making a post is a good first step in the right direction because I know everyone is so supportive <3.

Disordered,"I get sick far more often and I’m scared  I always read about this symptom and my stupid lil brain always thought that it wasn’t my case, therefore I’m faking my ED. 

But I went for the weekend in an old country home that my family owns and did some work that was needed and I noticed how much more heavy it was despite being always the one who did it, I didn’t remembered that my tools were so hard to carry or that I couldn’t finish something without resting. Almost immediately I got a flu because it was slightly chiller than the hot city where I live. 

My mother joked about it, how I can’t go nowhere without getting sick, and I laughed, no way. But then she remembered me how I got flu, high temperature and diarrhoea every time that I went to the seaside or did something outdoor this summer

The realisation was abrupt, she was right, I am much more prone to getting sick and terribly tired now that a year ago.

I know why peanut butter is such a common recovery craving but why cereal, dairy and grapes? Is it because of the things in them, like vitamins and calcium? I know that cereal usually has added vitamins, and grapes are.. mostly water I think, and I have to admit I am usually dehydrated lol

I also ate a lot of watermelon when it was in season, so I guess it is for the same reason"

Can someone please fill me in, my dr and therapist won't give me advice. I am seeing a nutritionist by october. But normally I feel quite well in summer heat, and this year I shake uncontroallbly and feel light-headed, dizzy and blurred vision. My neuromuscular disability acts up when it never has before in the summer. I am too unwell to go out, despite a chronic annual remission of symptoms, and its worse than the spasticity and pain in the winter, because I genuinely feel like if I walk in the heat or stay out in it, I'll [collapse](https://collapse.Is). Is it as dangerous as it feels to a lot of us? Im eating more than  I have in a yr. I know its still not what it could be, but when I upped eating last winter, I had increased energy and alertness, not this. I guess what Im really asking is, does heat affect us all this way, and will it once again be easier to manage recovery symptoms in the cold months, or is this just a part of recovery and it wont get better, even when it cools down in a couple months?

Disordered,"Read a book yesterday and felt very miserable  Yesterday I tried to read a book about eating disorder particularly anorexia and recovery from it. But the book was so stereotypical and triggered me a lot. Basically in the book the main character refused to eat anything just ate few pieces of popcorn all day and refused to eat medicines cause she didn’t know calories and shit like that. Reading it I felt like since I didn’t ate few pieces of popcorn all day and refused to eat medicines because of calories my restrictive eating wasn’t valid enough. In my restrictive phase I never went a day without eating, I would eat almost 2-4 times a day, didn’t exercise for 3-4 hrs,never consumed laxatives, fainted or had to be hospitalized. Do people really think that people with Ed’s are all obsessed about calorie and exercise and cry if they have to eat something."
Disordered,"How do you do this  How am I supposed to feel comfortable with myself when everything around me is constantly about appearance and weight? I can literally never escape it. It literally makes me furious. People even gain millions of followers just because they look a certain way.

I want to get help, but I’ve worked with so many crappy therapists that I’m scared to try again. I’m afraid they’re going to tell me that I don’t need help, or my pain is invalid because I’m at a medium sized woman.

I've struggled with restrictive eating & binging for most of my teen years, until it became very restrictive & has now rebounded into a terrible binging & purging cycle for the past year. It's become so consuming & draining.

I'm absolutely terrified for it, but I want to recover; I'm so exhausted with what my life has become, of what I've become. I just want to feel comfortable in my skin & stop sabatoging my relationships & opportunities. I know it's going to take time & effort & emotional energy, but I have to try.

Recovery,"Studies on males vs. females - AN  Does anyone have a list/ ANYTHING relating to studies on men regarding anorexia nervosa. I’m finding a really hard time finding credible in-depth research on how recovery may go for males and how anorexia affects males as opposed to females. 

I heard this somewhere but I’m not sure how accurate it is, that only 1% of research done on anorexia nervosa is done for males. I know a lot of the questions I have CAN be answered, it just seems they are only really answered when it comes to the opposing sex. Everyone in my personal life as far as I’m aware who has had AN was never a male. 

I may be completely wrong when I speak on this, I was just wondering if anyone here had any input on it. It feels very painful dealing with body dysmorphia, anorexia recovery and mental health issues alike when there isn’t a clear reason to why it’s happening, what to expect, and the lack of info about it for someone like myself."

Recovery,Online PCOS support spaces are ROUGH.  It’s all dieting/talking about dieting/keto bullshit. And lots of people get mad if I even so much as suggest that I can’t do those things to my body. It’s absurd and it gets to me. My ED hasn’t been this loud in my ear in years.
Recovery,"Seriously, SO frustrating when ""spokespeople"" for EDs in the public eye are obviously NOT fully recovered  There's a model who has spoken out against pressures and eating disorders in the industry, been vocal and public about having had anorexia, but her ""recovery"" is *barely* visibly noticeable and she's still the ""ideal"" body-type for a model - and still constantly posting body photos on instagram (where the ONLY focus is her body) and even ""throwback"" photos to when she was even more underweight (without even referring to them within the context of her disorder.)

She's not the only one. There's multiple ""celebrities"" I've noticed who speak about having *had* a restrictive eating disorder and having ""recovered"" when they clearly are still fucking IN IT. 

I feel like being *actually* recovered comes with an awareness that prevents the type of performative body posts these people contribute into the world. And, because I'm familiar with it, even certain angles and focus on certain bony parts of the body look very obviously like bodychecks... like, I KNOW why you choose THAT particular photo because I've fucking been there and know what I'm looking that.

Surely, actual recovery means you understand the effect the image you put out there is having on *other* people - but for some reason taking mirror selfies in a bikini (with no real point) is a good idea?! And it's suuuuper not disordered at all when 99% of your instagram photos are just photos of yourself :/ Like, I get that you're STILL a model and need to sell your self-branded image... but, how does doing so exist in the context of full recovery? I can't imagine going through recovery and then constantly taking photos of myself, constantly posting photos of myself, and doing so while focusing on how my body *looks.*

It feels *harmful* to have people be ""representing"" recovery in this disordered fashion. And, of course, the VAST majority of comments toward them are congratulating them on their recovery and bravery, etc."
Recovery,"Relapse worries after breakup  I’ve been recovered for over a year now but I’ve just had a hard breakup with my first love and now I’m worried about possible relapse. When things went wrong I had my boyfriend, he wasn’t always  there for me emotionally much but he was still present and that made me feel better, after the death of a close family member he was around, friendship breakups, life changes, I always had someone present, something to focus on. He was always on my mind so the other things didn’t matter as much, but now that’s gone, I feel like I have nothing to turn too, when things went wrong before I could turn to the anorexia, food and weight could be the only thing on my mind, constantly and yes it was so draining but it was something there, and now
I don’t have the other distraction of him I’m scared again. I have no appetite and the focus of wanting to just loose a little weight is there again, but I knkw a little is never enough for Ana, she always wants more, the food guilt is coming back. I do not want to be anorexic again, recovery was the best choice I ever made, when I was ill I was a complete shell of myself, I was so sick  I couldn’t even live and I still want to live now! . But everything seems to be going wrong again and I feel myself slightly slipping all over again. i don’t want to tell anyone really but here always felt like a safer place"
Recovery,"binged at night and feel full inthe morning, should i eat breakfast  i was tryna not b/p but last night before bed i ate 2 huge blocks of chocolate in addition to other stuff and was super full  and guilty but did not purge (yay) 

i could barely sleep but when i woke up today im still (gross) burping chocolate and feel as if my stomach is rock hard. 

i wad just wondering if i shpuld force myself to eat breakfast or not cause im still full from yesterday"
Recovery,"Does anyone else feel like this  I am in anorexia recovery and have been for.. a few weeks. the first few weeks was okay I guess but lately I've just been feeling completely full? Even when I haven't eaten for the whole day? And my appetite is gone too so now I have to go back to counting calories but so that I make sure I'm eating enough (how ironic lol) and I have to force myself to eat. 

I see posts about extreme hunger all the time and I feel like this is the opposite. When I make myself eat a normal amount I feel like throwing up.(not purging, like actually physically feeling like that) 

Is anyone else the same or do I perhaps have a different problem?"
Recovery,Someone please tell me the hair loss gets better  I hate showering now and can't stand to do my makeup or to put on a cute outfit or to look at myself in the mirror. My self confidence is lower than it was during my ED. I just feel completely hideous and worn out. After my shower today I just looked at all the fallen out strands of hair and cried for half an hour.
Recovery,"my most unhealthy mindset  is thinking that if i had a romantic partner to hold my hand through recovery, listen to me cry, and tell me everything’s gonna be okay and i’ll still be pretty, happy (yes i am happy even in UW quasi), funny, smart etc after i gain weight, i would have a way easier time recovering

granted i just set up therapy appts after 1.5 years of relapse so i hope that works too"
Recovery,"i need support and i have nobody to turn to, please provide some redditors  hey all! trigger warning: mentions of food and goal

i had a bad relapse these past 6 months or so due to my mother's controlling behavior and body shaming. My need to control my life and being unable to do so and essentially being her slave led me back down to this path and I am seriously underweight

To make matters worse...i developed a bad BAD habit of hiding food my spitting it out into napkins and tossing them later because i was served giant meals (not giant by ED standards, i mean like large for regular people)

the problem is now i am trying to eat better with a meal plan from my new therapist but she wont respect it. she thinks it is waaay too small a meal plan and says shit like if i wasn't gaining before, how am i supposed to gain now? I tried lying and since i got new meds, i said my thyroid was fucked and it will get better

anyways, now i have questions. i have been trying to follow my plan but I CANNOT HANDLE THE PAAAAAIN

it's only been a few days but holy shit, i can't even eat a serving of pasta without feeling like my stomach and chest will explode.

i just wanted to know if extreme bloating, fullness, etc. were expected and what else to expect? My therapist cannot speak with me and cannot answer questions until i see her next week.

please help alleviate my fears and tell me that it is normal and i appreciate any tips to alleviate the pains and bloat

p.s please don't be mean as it makes me upset and anxious"
Recovery,"just wrapped up an appointment with my psychiatrist  she prescribed me a new medication today and straight up said “don’t worry, this one doesn’t cause weight gain. i bet you’re happy about that, right?”


MA’AM??? YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING ME RECOVER???? PLEASE-


(this isn’t even a serious rant but why the fuck did she think that was helpful to say lmaoo)"
Recovery,should i eat if i’m not hungry  but i know i probably haven’t ate enough? i’m not trying to restrict at all btw! could i possibly be at my set point and my body is trying to tell me? it’s confusing 😭
Recovery,getting chain pizza for dinner tonight  it’s literally little caesar‘s which is like such garbage but i felt like something junky. my sweet tooth is a bit worn out from all of the frosting and cake batter i consumed while baking this afternoon so i want smth savory instead
Recovery,Week 3 of adding oils/fats to my food  I am cramping like crazy and I feel like my hormones are in overdrive. I haven’t had period symptoms/a period in over 10 years. I am so uncomfortable and struggling with the feeling.
Recovery,"What positive side effects of recovery did /do you experience?  Not things you set as a goal in recovery in the first place but little great things you notice during the process.

For me this is not feeling invisible anymore. For example when ordering bread in a bakery it feels like I'm being seen by the stuff and not just walked over, people sometimes hold a door for me when before it was just me holding the door open for them, friends catching up and asking how I am etc"
Recovery,"Eating a fear food every day  So, i meet with my dietitian once a month, and typically she gives me a challenge food to work on. the goal is to just have it one time to prove to myself that i can eat it.

well, last month she didn't give me one, so i just picked one myself. she loved the food so much that when we had our session last week where she adjusted my meal plan to incorporate that challenge food every day.

my ED has been screaming at me about it, but i haven't given in -- i've eaten that fear food every day for the past week!!

just wanted to share a little celebration. thank you for reading & if you've challenged a fear food of your own lately, feel free to drop a comment about it :)"
Recovery,"eating at school with an ED  Hi! I''m going back to school on Thursday. It's a new school so I'm a bit nervous. One of the things I'm really nervous about is eating there. At my school, you have to bring your own lunch and snacks. But at my old school, only a few people did that, which was quite triggering for me and was the reason for my relapse . I'm afraid that there won't be many people eating at lunch or people saying things like "" i don't eat at school"" or ""i haven't had breakfast"" etc. Does anyone know how to deal with that? Have fun at this school year ya'll!"
Recovery,"i think i need help  I’m trying not to have a panic attack while making breakfast and I was just hit with the realization that I think I need to get more help for my disordered eating. At the same time, I don’t feel like I deserve more help or that I need to get worse before I can deserve it. I know that’s disordered thinking but also a part of me still doesn’t want to let this go. 

I just didn’t expect to spend this year trying not to cry over breakfast I think I need help. I don’t even have a diagnosis or anything yet though."
Recovery,Side effects you should know but may not  Okay what hold up I just heard with anorexia the Brain and heart can actually shrink???
Recovery,"all in update  i made some progress. i´m in recovery for 4 weeks now and i started to kinda hounour my cravings for 1 week now. tomorrow i´ll go inpatient so i´m very scared that i just get triggered all the time and stuff like that but i hope for the best ! 

so here are my wins of the week : i ate at a restaurant ( chinese 😩) , i ate a entire block of chocolate ( i felt sick but it was woth it lol ).

stuff that was difficult: my body image is very bad atm, couldnt honour all my cravings so i still restricted a bit, i dealed with the trough to get very bad again to prove everyone how sick i am, i´ feeling very bad about the amount i eat.

&#x200B;

i know that i still could eat alotttttt more so idk what to do.i´m sometimes not even hungry but i waant to eat smth so idk helppp"
Recovery,"honored a craving!!  i don’t usually do this but since yesterday i’ve really really really been wanting french toast. so i made myself some for breakfast!!! i didn’t even have like half the things you need for it but it still came out good!! i made them into little french toast nuggets and topped them with cut up strawberries and powdered sugar. it was so so so good. and i was still hungry afterwards so i had a banana too!!! 

i’m still in like really restrictive and cal counting behaviors, but considering how badly i wanted it i just said fuck it!!!"
Recovery,"horrible eating disorder specialists  i’m literally giving up on these people at this point. 

tw for ridiculous triggering statements 

my psychiatrist started suggesting i fast to “heal” some of my mental and physical illnesses, and then she started suggesting i start keto, and THEN she told me i was too heavy to be anorexic anymore and so i must not even need treatment after gaining a bit of weight. i dropped her immediately after. 

but oh ho ho, it gets worse! 

my therapist started telling me about her sister who has anorexia and gave me numbers, specific events, and ranted on and on about how sick she was and how much “worse her eating disorder was, so i had nothing to worry about”. that wasn’t enough to make me stop seeing her, but then she started telling me i was a healthy weight (not that it matters btw, but i am NOT. i am uw and have always been while seeing her and she knows that.) and that i should be happy that i wasn’t a “sick anorexic”. her words, verbatim. she also told me that she would never have known i had an eating disorder unless i had disclosed it to her like i did. (+even worse things) 

so, yeah, now i don’t have a therapist OR a psychiatrist. and my dietician quit the field entirely. what the absolute hell is going on with treatment professionals? how do these people have licenses? 

i have literally no other option for treatment teams anymore, i have ran out of resources near me as they were literally the only ones. 

what is wrong with these people? i’m just so upset. i thought we would have better options at this point. i know eating disorders are so widely mistreated around the world and it pains me so much. i basically have no choice but to do recovery alone and with the occasional doctor visit now, and it is really bringing me down."
Recovery,"waiting…  Hi everyone! 16M here, I was looking for some advice from you guys because i’m feeling a little stuck.

I’ve recently decided to seek help for my ED, and so i’ve got my first assessment with CAMHS next Tuesday as well as a dietitian appointment this Saturday. The problem is, i’m becoming really impatient, im sort of ready to just start my journey now, but i’m too scared to do it without the support of professionals.

One side of my brain is saying to start eating more to prepare myself for treatment, but my ED is telling me that this will make me gain rapid weight and then CAMHS will say i’m ‘not sick enough’ (though this definitely isn’t true as my bmi would still indicate AN even if I gained a little)

This is manifesting quite badly, leading me to consume quite a low intake as i’m too nervous to eat anything more.

Does anyone have any tips to pass the time until I start? Or any advice on how to prepare myself? Thanks :)"
Recovery,"Relapse  Hey everyone! I tried to recover in May, I was severely underweight than. Since the begin of august I feel like I have fallen back into old habits. So right now a few days I am restricting, then the extreme hunger binging urges occur and the I restrict again. I don’t know how to escape this cycle. Even though my weight is in a healthy range, I still experience extreme hunger but if I give into it I restrict the next day. I just don’t feel like my eating disorder is valid anymore because I weight is healthy. Excuse my bad English this is not my mother tongue. I I don’t want to get overweight but is well I don’t want to live in this hell anymore. Everyone in my household has some kind of disordered eating habits. My mom praises me for not eating or not eating that much because she knows that I want to be skinny and does not understand the concept of an eating disorder. My father on the other hand encourages me to eat because he suffers from a Binge restrict cycle does not want me to experience the same."
Recovery,"quitting running  I have made the decision to quit running. For context, I’ve been struggling with compulsive exercise for years and my body is not in a good place now. i am so miserable dragging myself on runs every day, and I know that it is a big part of my eating disorder, as much as I don’t want to admit it. running can be so therapeutic and help with emotional regulation, but I’m at the point where it actually CAUSES anxiety. i am posting this for accountability. Exercise compulsion is a b****. I’ve tried to quit so many times but my Ed always finds a way to convince me to go back to it. I’ve been “trying” to do recovery for so many months and years, but have been unwilling to give up the exercise. And that keeps me stuck. for anyone else struggling with a similar thing, my heart goes out to you. we can get through this! 💜"
Recovery,"I don’t want to starve myself to death.  I need help, but I don’t know how to go about getting help. It’s been getting pretty hard recently, I’ve ended up at the hospital because my body was malfunctioning from going extended periods without eating. Even my family has started to notice something is wrong. I can’t even bring myself to pretend to eat so that they leave me alone. My friends have given me talks about how they can’t support and be happy about my weight loss. I really really need help and I don’t know anything about how to get it. please, if you have experience with in patient or out patient tell me what it’s like and also if there’a a specific thing or med or whatever helped you recover plz share the secret 
I’ve been alive basically only by the power of weed so far. It’s the only time I can eat."
Recovery,"impatience in recovery  no the title isn’t a typo, lol. I’m only a few weeks into some semblance of recovery, and I know compared to the time I wasn’t eating an appropriate amount this is a really really short time period. My hair thinning is what really pushed me to start recovery, as vain as it sounds, and it’s really upsetting to me that it’s going to take another year to see a positive difference :(. Does anyone who has been/is going through this have any advice on dealing with the impatience in seeing or feeling a difference? thanks ❤️"
Recovery,"Not sure what to do  Hello. This is gonna be written on a throw away account, mainly because I’m worried someone I know might see this. 

I really feel like I’m slowly dying, and I’m not sure what I can do to safe myself from that. I’ve dealt with so much trauma when I was younger, and it gave me an eating disorder. Every time I’m dealing with PSTD from my past, I refuse to eat. Well, more like I don’t feel hungry and I push it back, saying I’ll just eat later and later. I’m at the point where I’m getting too weak to even take care of myself. I wanted to see a therapist, but I’m broke. Is there anything I can do to start my journey into health?"
Recovery,took $50 out of my savings account to buy snacks at the store  i can’t work until i gain weight anyways so i might as well put the money i do have towards that :) probably not gonna spend that much since i’ve got other shit i wanna buy but i’m excited
Recovery,My dietician is literally trying to kill me  She gave me ice cream again  and I’ve told her multiple times I’m lactose intolerant n I don’t get a warning so basically once I eat the ice cream I’m in pain for hrs at a time and sometimes in to the next day like bro stop it pls
Recovery,"does anybody else have this problem?  this is kind of super specific so forgive me 

i have this problem where when i’m eating, i’ll go to swallow food and i start feeling like im choking (gross tmi warning from here on) and i have to basically,,, cough it back up my mouth as to not straight up choke to death and either try to swallow it again or spit it out

i read in tabitha farrar’s book that it was a side effect of eating disorders, which blew my mind, because i had no idea. this only started happening to me about a week ago, i’ve been in and out of recovery for a while now (sticking to it now for only about the past week or two) and it’s really really freaking me out. im super health paranoid as it is and this scares me so much as one of my number one fears is choking to death and is really making eating scary in a physical sense now. 

has this happened to anyone else? how on earth do i stop it?"
Recovery,"feeling like your disorder isn’t valid  feeling like your disorder isn’t valid is the worst thing on earth. i sometimes feel like oh i’m probably okay. i mean i eat at least two meals a day plus snacks. but i always make sure to stay under a certain number of cals >!(1,300)!< and burn a certain number of cals. and yet i still feel like i’m not disordered because i can eat stuff. but then i realize how sick i am when i get upset over my mom buying something that has “too many” calories. it’s just so hard realizing you have a problem but also not feeling valid “enough”"
Recovery,"WINNNNNN BABY  for the first time I stopped myself from doing a relapse, listen to my extreme hunger, and have not felt guilty for listening to my extreme hunger. All in the span of 24 hours. Like I am so satisfied and happy. The bloat is a little uncomfortable but that’s OK. RECOVERY WINS BABY! screw my ed it has no place in my life im gonna eat what I want and not feel bad!!!"
Disordered,"college update  just a little update on my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/wzfji5/college_was_a_mistake/)

I want to start by saying thank you to everyone who commented on my original post, all of your words and advice mean so much to me.

ive had a pretty hard few days. ive had no energy to walk to my classes, im feeling shaky, and im on the verge of crying in the library right now. I was in calculus before this and I just could not comprehend/concentrate on anything she was saying. I just don't want to be in this situation right now and I hate myself for putting myself in it. I literally haven't even been away for a week. ive tried so hard but I still can't really get myself to eat anything. I want to but I can't do it.

I did decide I needed to talk to my dietician. I just emailed him like five minute ago and was honest about everything going on this week. Im really worried for what he's going to say but im proud of myself for reaching out to him because a big part of me didn't want to so I could keep spiraling."
Disordered,"Keep me busy  I had to drop out of university. I tried working, but had to quit after two weeks. I know a lot of us in recovery have to put their lives on hold while working on getting better, but it’s devastating. Now I have to find something to occupy my days. Any suggestions?"
Disordered,"flapjack  so i am in some mental turmoil because my parents (who have been trying to get me to eat more) just gave me a flapjack (i ate it all) and i looked at the calories on the packet :( and it is like three or four times the amount id usually allow myself for a snack, and i had a larger breakfast and lunch (and i already had a brownie with lunch) and i know i need to up my intake because my weight is worryingly low but ugh… my stupid thoughts are bullying me and i just feel so helpless. also flapjacks are a big fear food for me, in part because people might not see them as unhealthy so they don’t realise how big it is for me to actually eat one."
Disordered,"Non-psych doctors w/ED experience??  Hey y'all - does anyone have recommendations for primary care providers and/or gastroenterologists anywhere in the US that have experience treating EDs in outpatient settings? I just finished a summer of treatment and am doing a lot better, but over a decade of AN has done some weird shit to my GI tract. I'd love to find a GI that could actually help with this, but it's soooo hard to find non-psychiatrist MDs with any ED experience at all. Thank you!!"
Recovery,unexpected recovery perk  it's so much easier to interact socially when you can actually participate in discussions about food and meals and not just awkwardly stare at the ground because your restriction meals aren't exactly peak conversation but you also can't think of Normal Eating Things on the spot
Recovery,"Still stuck  I saw somebody say you can’t feel happy in recovery if you’re scared of gaining weight, and that’s exactly how it’s been for me. 

Months ago, me and my family were going on vacations. Of course, food is a huge part of these get-togethers — which led me into reclaiming some comfort with eating. So it’s this unofficial and unintended start to recovery (I have yet to fully commit to it). From that point on, I ate more, got somewhat free from my restrictive lifestyle. Although I am eating more, I never got completely out of it. The months went by with me still struggling mentally, and even if I did have a good time whenever I’d eat with them, my restrictive mindset still had an influence somewhere. The compensatory responses never left. I never got rid of the fear of gaining weight; I am still averse to it. And it just sucks that it’s like this. I feel like I fail to make the most out of eating because I don’t enjoy. Looking back on those months, I was eating a lot more, definitely, but I was in a horrific headspace. As I eat and after I would eat, I worry. I worry if I’m overdoing it, I worry about the weight gain, I worry if I’m leading myself into a binge-eating disorder (which, I know now that it’s not the case). If I am going to allow myself to eat, I want to enjoy it. I want to be happy about it. If I work on towards getting better, I want to feel good as I do it. The past months where I fed myself more again, but also mostly felt nowhere near good, feel like almost a waste. I have gained from it already and yet I failed to make the time I had worthwhile to me. The way see it now — I have pointlessly used up most of my time in getting better and now I have much less of it. It’s like I have less time to enjoy healing with eating because in my head, I have set this limit. That it is only during a certain weight or apperance where I can pleasure myself and have less restriction. There is always a limit."
Recovery,"This is the second weekend in a row I’ve just allowed myself to eat “normally” and it’s really difficult to deal with.  Last weekend I spent with a friend away. We are out for every meal, had dessert one of the nights, and drink a little alcohol here and there. 

Yesterday I spent at a music festival, I drink, danced, sang, and had to just eat whatever was available and convenient. Again I was a social thing so I didn’t want to look like the odd one out. Today I woke up hungover, feeling so sick and sore. I had a pretty small breakfast because it was all I could manage but come lunch I decided to just get a McDonald’s because it was convenient and I couldn’t have stood up long enough to make myself anything. I had a burger, fries, a couple of cheese stick things and an apple pie which I halved and shared with a friend. I feel so gross afterwards even though the food did make me feel a little better. 

Im supposed to be having a BBQ at my parents house tonight, there’s going to be burgers, sausages, buns, potato salad etc - normal and expected BBQ food. I’m honestly so hungry today (despite my best efforts I don’t think I ate enough at the festival yesterday), I don’t know if I should just eat whatever I fancy and then deal with all the guilt and overwhelming feelings tomorrow, get over the past two weekends and move on as I normally would (im working on harm reduction and maintaining my current weight right now because mental im struggling to handle any more than that for various reasons). Or if I should stick to my safer options and not worry myself over the meal too much.

I can’t tell you how horrible and out of control I feel right now. But equally I still feel super unwell/hungry do I feel like I’m a little stuck especially as I know that this weekend might push my weight over where I feel comfortable right now."
Recovery,"TMI but holy shit  Literally. I started my period today and I've upped my calories and since waking up at 7 am (now 11:30) I have had 4 normal sized poops. That's it, I just needed to complain about the constant pooping."
Recovery,"songs for recovery?  This is a weird one but I really identify with ""praying"" by Kesha as a song to my ED/recovery. 

  
Do you have a song that you listen to?"
Recovery,Think I’m spiralling - or is this normal for girls my age?  So I’ve been on and off thinking I struggle with an ed. I go through phases where I eat loads and then feel disgusting and eat almost nothing. I find every time I eat less I do it for longer and longer and I’m worried I’m spiralling. I ate a big roast dinner last night and now I just feel disgusting. Is this normal? Is this what an ed is or am I just a normal girl having normal thoughts?
Recovery,"“mindful eating” driving me insane sometimes (and diet culture as a whole really)  i know it’s important to be aware of my fullness and stuff BUT also in a recovery context it’s important to eat at least (AT LEAST) three meals a day REGARDLESS of if you’re hungry or not and like when i eat mechanically (which i usually need to for at least one meal of the day) i feel like Oh That Wasn’t Very Mindful Of Me :( even if it was like a small meal cobbled together of stuff that was light and easy to eat so i could manage without upsetting my stomach but also give myself a decent amount of energy. the inevitable end result of this is me spending an insane amount of time second guessing my hunger and if i’m /really/ hungry or if i’m bored/thirsty/tired. 

i feel like basically every food rule that isn’t like “don’t steal food” basically just goes out the window in recovery but fuck if i don’t have a lot of diet culture stuff embedded into my head… the worst is when websites will have articles that are like “five tips for family members of anorexia patients” or w/e and than in the related articles is like five reasons why refined sugar is bad for you. five foods that are making you fat. etc."
Recovery,"I’m so scared of getting fat  I know I shouldn’t be, I know I should’ve accepting of my body whatever size it is, but I just don’t know how. How do you not attribute your worth to your weight, it’s like as soon as I perceive any sort of weight gain I just feel like an awful awful human being."
Recovery,"Caught covid after my bday  This is the funniest most unhinged- 

Idek what to do anymore because now I have to eat to fight this virus off however that's more difficult than ever since I can barely get up. 
The one time I'm opting for food I simply cannot get any 😭"
Recovery,"Is it normal to eat after 8-9pm? (EH)  I’ve been dealing with EH (extreme hunger) for a month or 2 now and I had a breakdown because I didn’t have dessert for after dinner (because I ate it from an EH episode) so I had a BPD episode and ran away from home for like 4 hours and then I came home after walking for that long.
Mum offered to take me to the shops to honour my extreme hunger cravings even though it’s 8pm at night she’s so supportive with my EH and helps a lot. 
But I want to no if it’s normal to go out to buy a specific food late at night and eat it?
Also my EH seems to be happening everyday is that normal too?"
Recovery,"Very conflicted and needy  i don't know how to talk to people about this but im suffering and dying and keeling over.

i feel like i cant open up 2 anyone because its such a ridiculous issue ummsmwmwmqmwmq. Currently working on recovery and getting my shit tested (blood syuff!!!) and i havent been saying anything to my friends because i don't want to trigger anyone. Also lots of my friends just don't eat because of their adhd medication and it's really triggering but i don't know what to say, if i should say anything, and if/how i should help them?!!!/! 


I'm scared of what itll be like when i weight restore. it feels like i'm losing or giving up or somethjng and i feel super weak-willed for eating more?? But i want to have more things in my life (uni next year, exams, books and art and movies etc) + i don't want to get worse + i'm scared for my health and relationships :("
Recovery,"(TW: would like support after an ed relapse post car accident)  Would like some reassurance and support. I have been doing pretty well the past several months but am relapsing horribly after a car accident a week or so ago. I’ve been following body neutrality, so this relapse is more about control rather than appearance/looks. It felt more apparent when one of my housemates I hadn’t seen in awhile asked if I was okay because how “small and thin” I had gotten and felt my arms. Even though she showed genuine worry, I have had this dread ever since that others can tell my true physical and mental state especially since everyone’s been telling me I look pale and sickly, even though I have always been more light skinned and am fairly short in stature. 

In addition, I unfortunately had to be terminated from my counselor who I felt really understood me because loss of university student insurance and it feels like my only source of control right now is to restrict because I have virtually no appetite right now. Honestly, the compounded self- and narcissistic dad guilt has been fueling this relapse and it makes me feel unworthy. Harmless jokes are making me overthink and go down the rabbit hole and I haven’t been this anxious in a long time. I also have overmedicalization trauma due to past experiences that were just because insurance required me to take several classes of medications that really harmed me, so please don’t recommend me to seek a psychiatrist. Thank you for those who have good intentions though, but I think the side effects of withdrawal and intolerances to many medications has had a lasting impact on me.

Mental health-wise, I keep having intrusive thoughts that I need to punish myself even though I feel so selfish because my other friends and family are worried about me. I’ve started talking to one of my best friends again who I’m now unsure how I feel about her (since we have had a pretty complicated situationship), since I feel like sometimes I’m really happy but today I’m crying and feeling numb. Even though she’s been fairly supportive, anytime she makes a joke criticizing me for something I did before when I was more dysregulated and anxious, it feels like I should push her away.

With work, it’s also frustrating because I feel the need to overextend myself to make up for the accident since my car was totaled, but my body is still recovering from the accident injuries. Even my full time work has been accommodating but it sucks because my contract job is being unreasonable and not accommodating my condition which makes me angry at how poor they value workers rights… 

At the end of the day, I will do my best to apply what techniques I’ve learned from counseling, but sometimes having a safe space such as this subreddit makes me feel comfortable enough to admit the extent of my suffering to people that don’t know me personally. 

Thank you for those who read this far and I am in a safe environment and I just wanted support and reassuring words to keep going and to remember healing is not linear. It feels nice to not have to yell into the abyss or have fear of trauma dumping on my loved ones."
Recovery,What to put frosting on?  This is in response to a recent post about vanilla frosting that has absolutely inspired me to go buy a tub of some tomorrow. What are your favourite things to put frosting on?? The weirder the better!
Recovery,"PHP hasn’t helped me at all and my parents don’t believe me  i have given the program my all, i complete the homework, participate in every group, am 100% meal compliant, and am being as recovery minded as possible…but the program just sucks. but the number on the scale is higher and im eating now, so in the eyes of my parents the program has worked miracles. but what they can’t see is that it’s made me more miserable than my eating disorder ever did, mentally i’m in a worse place than i was when i entered, everyday that i’m there i get more depressed and lose more motivation to recover. i dont feel like it is possible to get better when surrounded by all these sick people, the other patients still hide food at meals, feed meals at home to their dog, and talk about how they can’t wait to relapse when they get out. the longer i’ve been there the more i’ve come to believe that full recovery is not possible, the program is not working. the kids who are farther along in the program have only become better liars. i tried to express this to my parents and they just dismissed it as my eating disorder taking, i fucking hate being treated like an animal because i have a mental illness, nothing i say will every amount to anything in their minds. my opinions are nothing more than noise to them because that’s what the therapists at the program tell them. i fucking hate everything. it has made me so unbelievably hopeless about my future. my life is nothing more than wasting time until it’s time to fall asleep again. i just want to die. my ed never made me feel this fucking miserable yet my parents say they just want me to be happy and healthy, but this is by no means healthy. i’m fucking sick of it."
Recovery,"vanilla frosting  ever since starting recovery i basically have some sort of sweet treat with every meal, usually a couple of homemade cookies or a cupcake, or a piece of chocolate. today i decided to have a cupcake and since i’ve been craving vanilla frosting - not the stuff i’ve been making with greek yogurt (which for the record is still pretty good - but not what i wanted right now) - i decided to put some on. in recovery i’ve almost developed this weird neurotic fear of added sugars - because you know, so much health stuff out there demonizes them (the ana to ortho pipeliner has logged on I guess), so having something that’s like sugary feels like a bit of an accomplishment. i even had a spoonful or two straight out of the jar lol. it was so good"

Recovery,"How long does the body take to recover fully?  I've been wondering this as to how long does it take for your body to start trusting it'll get the nutrients it needs?

Recovery,"Eating consistently is hard sometimes but the feeling of accomplishment is so worth it  I have ADHD and it makes the entire process of eating unbearably mundane… and one of the reasons it was so easy for me to fall into disordered eating in the first place. It was fine when I first entered recovery as my EH was coupled with a hyperfixation on food, so it was easy to enjoy the process. Now, 2.5 years in, it’s very difficult for me to fall into a “normal” pattern of eating. I mean, don’t get me wrong,  99% of the time I eat what and when I want, and I always eat enough, but it can look very… chaotic. I work long hours, and my days off throw me out off my schedule so I often wait a bit too long to eat.

I’ve been going through a lot these last few months and and recently that has affected my eating. I’m not relapsing, but my partner had taken notice and became more vigilant in making sure I had food, that I ate dinner, etc. It helps to have someone to push me, but he’s visiting family for the next week and I’ve got a 5 day weekend coming up, so it’s just me, myself, and I (basically a recipe for chaos as far as my eating is concerned). 

Welp, I’ve been making sure I’ve been eating every few hours even though there are *a thousand* other things I’d rather be doing in that moment, and the accomplishment I feel is so fucking nice. Plus, it fuels my hours of hyperfixation on painting and drawing, which is always a bonus.

Moral of the story: if you’re struggling twitch having to eat consistently, you’re not alone. It’s annoying as fuck—but if you can’t focus on the food, focus on the fact that you did it anyway, and enjoy the energy and mental clarity it gives you."
Disordered,"i need help: im trying to recover but it’s been harder than expected  hi, i (26f) am trying hard to recover. i am in treatment with an amazing psychologist and psychiatrist but sadly, i don’t have enough money to go to a nutritionist yet, therefore i’ve done enough researching to help myself eat more.

the problem is that usually during the week i’ll try and eat 2 full meals and 4 snacks, i also don’t restrict if someone offers food or invites me to hang out, but on weekends i have this hyper fixation on fasting (20 hrs or more) but since lately i eat more during the week, my body literally shuts down and i am at the border of fainting/losing strength/feeling like my heart it’s going to fail/fall. i dont know what it is but i just can’t have breakfast for example, no matter if i eat breakfast during the week.

i am genuinely scared and terrified of it, im crying as i write this because i just fell and had all the symptoms i previously described. I usually eat a banana if this happens and lay down.

does anyone have any tips on how to get out of that shaky/faint-ish state that does not involve food to be eaten just when it’s happening? because i get real dizzy. and does anyone have any tips on how to slowly introduce meals when this mindset gets stuck in your mind?

Disordered,"weird hunger cues  does anyone else experience this thing where their body is doing what it does when they’re hungry (the “empty” stomach feeling, lightheadedness, etc) so they go into the kitchen to make food and than when they actually have that food in front of them they don’t actually feel hungry. i made breakfast slash lunch (i slept in lol) this morning and it was relatively small (a couple of baked oat chocolate chip muffins and an english muffin with cheese and a veggie patty on it, plus some strawberries. not a tiny breakfast but not a huge one either) and like it was… really hard to eat? like i just did not feel hungry or compelled to eat.. i managed to get thru it because i didn’t wanna throw it out (except the strawberries because i can just put them back in the fridge) but it took me like 45 minutes lol. i just feel like this kind of thing happens all the time when i try to eat. is this something anyone else experiences in recovery? 

for context, i KNOW i’m nowhere close to recovered, either physically (i’m maybe >!5!< lbs or so above my lowest weight) or mentally (the restrictive urges come and go, but the past few days they’ve been pretty bad) but eating sometimes feels like such a fucking chore and trying to figure out my hunger cues drives me insane on days like this."
Disordered,"honouring cravings with Crohn's disease  Hi! Question: how do I navigate recovery hunger with Crohn's disease? Some foods are harmful to my intestines and will leave me crying in pain on the toilet for hours (this was already the case before I started restricting). Those foods do, however, come up in my cravings and I'm kind of at a loss. Sugar is a recurring culprit, salty processed snacks. Finding ""dupes"" feels like restriction and is therefore triggering. Anyone else here with experience? Thanks in advance!"
Disordered,"Death to keto  I cannot BREATHE without seeing people or comments or posts or videos talking about how amazing keto is and how going “sugar-free” helped them and everybody praising them for caring for their body or having discipline. It all has such a judgmental, condescending air to it and it’s one of the things that makes recovery so difficult!

I swear the Internet, ESPECIALLY eating and dieting spaces, would demonize eating a blueberry muffin made with sugar, eggs, butter, and flour. -_-"
Recovery,"Feels like I could just let it go?  So after a successful day yesterday and so far today of kind of not calorie counting and joining in with others fairly unrestricted it feels like maybe I could just let the ED go? 
I‘m on my way home from an intense group seminar weekend and after intense exhaustion to begin with, I had a taste of what life could be like again without the disorder. But now it almost feels too easy to let go? On the other hand I‘m already starting to worry about what I‘ll eat for the rest of the day and feeling scared of „losing the ED“. So it seems easy but then again not? 
And again I kind of wish someone would just constantly give me permission to listen to my hunger."
Recovery,"my skin looks AMAZING!!!!!  ok, so I am about 3 weeks into actually recovery from restriction and, honestly, it’s been really difficult. I’ve gained weight pretty quickly, and definitely not in places I am comfortable with, particularly my face. I woke up this morning feeling some not so nice things about myself, feeling puffy and bloated… but THEN I looked in the mirror and WOW. it seriously looks like the life was brought back into my face overnight. even despite the acne (which I think has been brought on from hormone shifts possibly??? not sure if it’s too early to see those effects or not) it’s just like so plump and smooth… lol. it’s kind of crazy to see after looking so tired and dead for so long

i know I’m very early on in my recovery but idk, this is just the first thing I’ve really been able to appreciate about my body since it’s started changing and that makes me really happy and hopeful that I’ll be able to love my increasingly healthy self as time goes on :)"
Recovery,"BED or Delayed Extreme Hunger?  I've been doing anorexia recovery for about a year and a half on my own after 7 years of being anorexic. When I went to college, I crashed and burned and relapsed really bad. But one day, I was in my dorm room and remember being so frustrated that I opened a bag of trail mix and just started eating. I ate and ate and just couldn't stop. Which created a pattern. I started buying trail mix and granola and eating the whole bags. Which then escalated to eating whole boxes of granola bars, bags of granola and trail mix, containers of cream cheese with pretzels or slices of bread, pints of ice cream, loaves of banana bread, etc. Just about anything I used to fear. I didn't know about extreme hunger at the time, so I fought it, convinced I was binging and never fulfilled my hunger until it became insatiable and I started having those eating episodes. Now about 15 months later, I still can't stop eating or thinking about food. I'll be physically satisfied, but still mentally starving.  But it feels like binging. I'll go to the store and buy all of those foods and eat them all in one sitting. I'm at a healthy weight, over my set point actually, but the hunger hasn't subsided and I'm afraid I've gone from anorexia to BED."
Recovery,"Pizza is no longer a fear food :)  I've been having pizza every Sunday for a few weeks now. Which is crazy considering it was my biggest fear food. But having challenged it so regularly, I'm actually starting to look forward to it. And guess what day it is? That's right! Pizza Sunday ❤️ Instead of ordering one, we'll make our own (with premade pizza dough bc we're lazy lol) and I'm so excited for it. The last time we made our own pizza, I barely put any cheese on mine. And cheese still scares me A LOT. But I'm planning on being a bit braver today. 
I'll put zucchini, tomato, arugula and either tuna or chicken on my pizza. Haven't decided yet. I haven't had tuna in forever. I only tried it once before and I didn't like it, but back then I didn't like any seafood. I'll try some before putting it on my pizza, of course.

Also, I'm kind of hoping my stepdad remembered that I've been craving waffles. I asked him if he could make some a few days ago. Maybe today is the day? I'm a bit anxious over not knowing. Pizza and waffles in one day.. My ED is screaming! 
Though I think he won't make them today, since he left to get some bread rolls from the bakery just now. Maybe he forgot. But I'll remind him next weekend! And if he doesn't want to make waffles, I'll just have to make them myself, even if they're not as good as his."
Recovery,"I can’t stop eating until i vomit (physically)  TW: weight, calories


Even though my nutritionist put me on a 2500kcal meal plan, I'm a female who weighs 39 kg and is 5'5"". I've been on recovery for two weeks, and so far, it's been awful. I have to keep a trash can right next to me so I can throw up whenever I need to because I can't stop eating until I am physically sick and on the verge of passing out. I had two episodes of vomiting today because I was unable to control my cravings. I know that tons of recovered or people in recovery have advised me to honour my hunger cues, so I did but it made me physically sick worse than when I was restricting (ik this sounds terrible but it is true)"
Recovery,"personify your ed voice if you have one as wrong and annoying  Idk if y'all have an Ed voice in your head or not and frankly I've never rly figured out if personifying it outside of yourself is good or bad. I've heard some people say it's good for their recovery but I've seen so many disordered people online rly weird about it and being like ""ana told me to do x"".  At that point it sounds like you're taking the responsibility away from yourself entirely and that personifying ""ana"" will only make her louder and make you think something else is in control of you. I knew enough even when I was actively disordered to not fall down that rabbit hole bc I figured for me it would be one. I got bad but I didn't try to pretend it was ~something else~ the way some people talk about ""ana"".  Felt weird to me too.  But everybody has a different brain so if that works for people's recovery that's great. 

 So for me I don't explicitly personify it as literally another voice or especially not another person bc I feel that'd make it worse. But theres a voice. It's my own thoughts but they're symptoms of the disorder so it's the ""ana voice"". It's me telling myself to do disordered things or thinking critcal about my body or being scared of recovery and weight gain and hunger signals etc etc. Sometimes it's the weird pride ones about when I do listen to the Ed or think I look skinny or whatever. Yuck 

I distance myself from it by calling it the Ed voice or the ana voice so I know it's wrong and not inherently right. But I also acknowledge it's my own disordered thoughts so that I can take responsibility for them and responsibility for my recovery. That's what works for me and I hope if y'all experience a voice like that you can find whatever relationship with it that helps you recover. 

Ever since I saw the tv show the boys uh the  narcissistic villain homelander says some fatphobic stuff to another character in the third season that came out this summer  and it just fucking replays in my head rent free. I was struggling to eat dinner today and I kept thinking about it and it was not helping. It doesn't actually make me worse,  but it doesn't feel good thinking about it.  I was relapsing this summer when it came out too so that doesn't help. 

One thing that works for me though is whenever I start to think disordered shit about my body or wanting to do disordered actions lately I try to catch myself and I pretend it's homelander saying it to me and I'm like fuckkkk this dude he's crazy wtf is he talking about??? You're crazy dude I'ma eat actually. I don't engage in self loathing or criticize myself for those thoughts but I do go like ""This crazy.  this some homelander shit. Wtf is this?? This ain't even true"".
 And it helps me end the train of thoughts lol.

If you all have disordered thoughts I hope you find your own ways to lessen and mediate them. Your thoughts aren't your reality and you don't have to listen to them. Where did they come from anyway? They didn't necessarily come from /you/. 

Hope y'all take care and good luck with y'all's recoveries. I just been struggling a little and felt getting this off my chest would help me and maybe help others."

Recovery,"I'm always sure of the fact that I'm gaining weight, even though I'm not.  I hate my brain, so much. I went on a one month long vacation in a place full of rich and delicious food, and I swear, everytime I sat at a restaurant, in particular in later weeks, it was such a struggle to choose what to eat. 

LONG WINDED BACKGROUND:

 I restricted my calories for a year in the past, rapidly losing weight, hunger cues, periods and energy, and it's been a couple of years since I've actively stopped doing that (although I have had relapses), and since then I've gained about 10 kg, eating in abundance and regularly, and reducing exercise, to recover my hunger cues through out the first couple of lockdowns. 

Now I try to intuitively eat, and to find what works for me lifestyle wise (to feel my best, to have ok gut wealth etc), ignoring my calorie count (which I can't stop doing). I've also read a lot about the actual calories humans bodies need (way over the fda guidelines), and for a period have been experimenting eating even more freely, going over what I though was my maintenance when I wanted to, that usual 2000 treshold everyone recommends (I'm also quite tall, can't believe for so much I thought my tdee was even below that number), and, followed by a nutritionist (with whom we estabilished my goal was maintenance, and the only rules she gave were to have regular meals at certain times, and some other nutrition tips, no calories or anything), I saw that I was maintaining my weight. 

Now it's been months since I've seen that nutritionist, so I haven't weighed myself. I'm focused on my behaviours, no need to measure my body. Still, looking at myself in the mirror, I was 100% sure of having gained a few kgs in the past 3 months. And I was working on accepting that, focusing on maintaining my casual-healthy lifestyle (aka trying to eat the best quality wise when at home, and doing sports and working out 3 times a week, but only if I feel like it, no pressure, and also eating out or drinking alcohool socially quite often, whenever there's the opportunity), and on apprecciating that my body was a reflection of my lifestyle and mental health, and that when I had the skinny body of my dreams, I was still insecure and absolutely miserable. 

END OF BACKGROUND

Anyways. I went on this vacation, and tried to enjoy myself. I backslid a bit, being extremely indecisive when facing a menu, just because we were eating out and quite a lot at every meal, and at dinner I wanted to stay lighter, but it was pretty much impossible without missing out on the specialties. Also my mother is aware of my issues, and herself is very thin and eats way less than me, which put me a bit under pressure of eating freely, but also in competition of not eating too much more than her - not to mention the extrem diet culture discourses we were surrounded by when I was with her boomer ex-thin friends also got in my head. So, it was occasionally challenging, in particular in the later weeks, when I got constipated and bloated, and was sure it was because of this lifestyle. I made an effort to eat everything I wanted at least 2/3ds of the time, and that 1/3rd was in order to not overeat at dinner time (which makes me wake up really groggy the next day, and in general avoid), trying to listen to my hunger cues and not stuff myself, but still stuffing myself when the food was too delicious and special to not enjoy it at the max! 

So yeah not total food freedom, but my best effort in a challenging environment. And I was so sure of having gained weight in all of this, that when we entered in a drugstore and there was a scale, I decided to check, picturing in my head an higher number, but also telling myself that it was a reflection of that current lifestyle, and that if it wasn't my set point it would have gone back to the usual once back at home. And also, that even if it didn't, it was ok, long as my behaviours still suited me well. Well, my weight was in the usual range. The one estabilished in the 6 months of tracking it with my nutritionist. On the higher end, sure, but nothing new. And back home, yesterday, I weighed myself at a friend's house, to see if that was now my set weight, and I was again in the middle of my range, as usual. Without trying to compensate for anything previously, just eating and drinking the usual, somedays more somedays less.

And it's so frustrating. How much I pick at myself, body check, want to control my body and my weight, that I get taken out of the moment, get anxiety reading through a menu, and hate so many photos taken of me (that whenever I rivisit laters months, I think look great!!) and all for a completely imaginary problem. It's been more than a year that I've maintained what is my current set point, and time and time again, I convince myself that I'm actually fatter than I was a few months back. And then it's not true, and later on, looking back at the me from that period, I think I look great.

Sorry this was all over the place, but wow, dieting ruined my brain. Working on it, but wish I could eat like so many people who don't ever think about this, or that there wasn't a disordered eating pattern or straight up eds in every woman member of my family.

Hope someone relates, and hope we get out of this rut."
Recovery,"OCD and Eating  Hello!

This is a throwaway account I made as I'm a bit too ashamed to talk about this on main, but I've been lurking in this community for a while and found it to be especially welcoming, so I figured I'd talk about it here. This is mainly because what my disordered eating has evolved to is beginning to scare me.

For about a month now, I've been struggling with a ""sort of"" eating disorder. What I mean by this is that I'm not prototypically anorexic, bulimic, or struggling with binge eating. In my case, I struggle with intense OCD, and how this relates to eating is that I somehow got it in my head a month ago that I need to lose weight despite being >!104 pounds!< and >!5'3!<, even before I began restricting (this was mainly due to weight loss rhetoric around the house and celebrity culture). The best way I can describe what I'm going through is that ""I need to lose weight"" is like this thought that is a constant in my head, and subsequently, all my behaviours revolve around that. Subsequently, I've been partaking in a lot of unhealthy habits for somebody my weight; namely consuming >!1200 calories!< on a daily basis, going on hour to two hour long walks especially when it is warm out, and exerting myself at my already very active job. In the past month, I've lost >!six pounds!<, which for me places my >!BMI at 17.0!<. I quite literally weigh as much as my fifteen year old self (I'm nineteen, female). This frightens me, especially because I've noticed how unhealthily thin I've become, the perpetual fatigue, and the fact that I had to get an electrocardiogram done by my doctor because of how much weight I've lost. Luckily, my heart is healthy.

I've become quite frightened in the process of all this, because it's sort of like this trapped feeling; for those also with OCD, it is extremely difficult to break the habits without feeling immense discomfort and upset. It sometimes feels like you can't go on normally if you do not indulge your compulsions. But at the same time, I know I'm hurting my health and I'm worried I will do serious damage to my heart or organs considering my already very low BMI, but it always feels like I can't stop. It also does not help when my close friends and relatives try to shove food in my direction either, as the amount of guilt I feel eating over >!1200!< is intense.

I guess by posting this I am hoping for advice or even just a listening ear. I've consulted my psychologist, doctor, and family about this as I know this is terrible for my health, but sometimes, it's really difficult to explain it to them or feel understood in my fear of what will happen to me, as to them it's a quick fix situation, but for me it's incredibly difficult. Thank you for reading, and you all are so strong. I hope we can all get through this together."
Disordered,"college was a mistake  so ive definitely posted on here before about trying to get to college, and now im actually there. I moved in on Wednesday, and honestly, it has been pretty bad! I thought it would be great, and I would have freedom, and make new friends and everything would be amazing. I thought that all of my problems would just go away, but they've just gotten worse.

The social aspect hasn't been good, im too anxious to talk to anyone so ive mostly been alone. I feel so isolated and depressed, and its mostly my fault.  The eating disorder behaviors have gotten pretty bad again. I haven't exactly had anything to eat in a bit, and ive spent most of my time since being here compulsively walking eight ish miles around campus/downtown all day. I used to be able to talk myself into eating but this past week I just have not been able to. 

Im at a normal weight now, and so in my mind it makes me feel like this is ok, and that I don't need or deserve help (I KNOW this isn't true but I can't believe it right now). I wanted to prove so badly to everyone that I could do this, but I don't know if I can. This is really just a rant but Im just really struggling and I have no idea what to do.

Recovery,how am i supposed to be on with my body?  i hate it. i don’t understand how i’m supposed to recover and accept my body when all i want to do is lose weight again. i hate the way i look and that’s only getting worse the longer i recover. my stomach feels huge and i feel disproportionate. when i was actively restricting i felt so much more confident about my body now even tho i’m still underweight my stomach is a lot bigger. i’m not sure if i just gained a lot of weight or what but i’m very upset about it and it’s making me want to restrict again. i can’t even imagine a world where i have neutral feelings regarding my body let alone positive ones.
Recovery,"This illness ruined my face  Before I developed anorexia at age 19, I was known for having “chubby” cute cheeks and obviously at the time I didn’t want this and didn’t appreciate what was in retrospect a really charming/pretty feature. My cheeks weren’t even actually chubby but just larger cheekbones and a round and healthy appearance if that makes sense. After I recovered the first time, I was able to regain my healthy body again and my face actually went back to its normal set point. But after relapsing again and trying to recover, it seems like this time around my face is not going to recover. I look malnourished and exhausted. And no matter how much I eat I just look like that now. I’m terrified that that’s how I’ll look permanently even if I achieve full recovery . I know looks matter less than health but for me I also have body dysmorphia so this is really bothering me. It’s like a new level of body dysmorphia except it’s the opposite of what it was before. I’m now worried about looking so sick and tired. :("
Disordered,"weird abstract thought i had  i feel like giving into an eating disorder is like the spiritual equivalent of sleeping alone in a twin bed

Disordered,"Did I damage my gag reflex?  I'm in recovery from anorexia, purging type. I often throw up while brushing my teeth or if I ate too much/too quickly and had to run to the bathroom because I was throwing up. Did I do some permanent damage by purging so much for years? Is there anything I can do to fix whatever it is?"
Disordered,"Weird itch in hands?  Hi, it's me, the girl constantly freaking out at any change in her body. Last night and this morning I noticed like... a slight itch/swelling feeling in my hands, and I'm wondering if maybe it's because of the improved blood flow, but I'm also worried it might be refeeding? I say a feeling because there's no visible change at all in either of my hands. It does coincide with my attempting to eat more, but I counted the calories of the meal I've had and there's no way that amount should cause refeeding syndrome. Did anyone else experience this? Is it maybe just anxiety?"
Disordered,"Pregnant and panicking  And also feeling super invalid bc since finding out, I’ve been able to eat normally (although obsessing over my weight and immense guilt continue). I feel like I need to eat very frequently or else I get nauseous and throw up. This happened with my 1st too and I gained a lot… leading to this relapse. 

Well, I’m 7 weeks and gained 4 lbs already. Honestly prob from bloating and stopping restricting but I’m in a sheer state of panic. I can’t gain the 40lbs I gained last time. I don’t know what to do. But I do know that this baby needs to be nourished so I’m feeling pretty fucking invalid right now because I’m refusing to starve myself and risk life long issues for my child. But I’m panicking like hell."
Recovery,"broke my final ed rule! LIQUID CALS!!  i went to shake shack with my friends, and i usually always get a diet coke cause im a coward lmao🥱

but today i REALLY wanted a strawberry milkshake cause i haven’t had one in ages. and my brain was telling me nahh you can’t have that with a burger and fries, but you know what I GOT IT AND IT WAS SO GOOD!

milkshakes with meals are my BIGGEST fear food ever and im so happy i finally broke that rule. cause if i can have a FUCKING MILKSHAKE i can have any other drink too"
Recovery,"Eating with loved ones  Honestly I love eating with my family. Though I had the comfort disrupted, yet again, I’m happy when I eat with my mom. I feel comfortable being at the dining table with her, having food, and not having as much defeaning thoughts. Eating with your loved ones is just such an intimate thing and I personally value it so much. I love to share a piece of my food with someone. I hope in time, I can be completely comfortable being done the same way. For now, I’m happy that I have people I can eat with and I’m comfortable with, and we dine like it’s just how life is and it’s not like the horror I’ve known it to be."
Recovery,"""not in the mood"" to purge?  Does anyone else also feel this way? When I eat a large amount of food, my first instinct is to purge. But there are times that I'm like ""I don't feel like purging today"" or ""I'm too tired to purge rn"", and I mean that's gotta be good, right? Since I'm trying to recover and all. But it's just that my brain doesn't know how to stop at that. My thoughts just keep on spiraling, and I can't sleep or calm down unless I've purged to get the thoughts out of my mind. My brain likes to make me feel guilty like: ""oh you suck at having an ed"" and shit. Idrk what I'm doing with this post, but maybe I'd just like to rant my feelings out. If you also got some tips or anything at all, feel free to comment. I'd just really want this feeling and the thoughts to stop, but I guess that's not really possible. :(("
Recovery,"feeling so frustrated and lost  I feel so frustrated and lost and I don't know what to do anymore.

I considered myself recovered for a long time. A little over a year ago I stopped restricting. I told myself I could just eat whatever I wanted because I was so underweight. I thought I was listening to my body.

Now a year later I feel like I am waking up and seeing that my eating is still disordered. Like I have seen other people here struggling with the same problem. I don't eat during the day then I eat so much during the evening and wake up to eat more at night. Then there are rimes during the day even that I eat and eat but it's like no matter how much I eat I am still hungry.

I just have been looking at my body more and more over the past few months and becoming increasingly hateful towards how much I have gained. I am already overweight. I am scared if I give up control during the day I will gain even more. I am slipping more and more into thoughts glorifying my days restricting and looking at pictures of myself wjen I was underweight all the time as well as looking at thinspo. 

I thought that I was fine and that I would be okay with whatever my body did but I realised all these hateful thoughts about my body were just lurking under the surface. I am so frustrated. I just want to be able to eat like a normal person and be happy and not consumed by food all of the times.

I feel so trapped because I am so scared of gaining more weight. I know I won't be but my mind keeps telling me how much happier and easier it would be if I went back to restricting."
Recovery,"Weight gain? Relapse?  TW: weight and numbers

Ok so I have been listening to my body and eating what it wants when it wants. It has been a close upward to <4000> a day for about a week, give or take. i know i should weigh myself but it says i’ve gained almost <10 pounds>. is this even possible. so now i just added my calorie counting app back and i decided to take diet pills again. am i making the wrong decision? i just don’t want to gain a bunch of weight before my homecoming dance in a month… idk how to stop myself from doing the wrong things."
Recovery,"DAE feel like a massive fraud?  I've been trying to recover for like a year and I've gained weight, a lot and I'm weight restored. but it's mostly been through a binge restrict cycle, eat little during the day binge at night and wake up in the middle of the night to eat even more

sure at the beginninf there was extreme hunger which made the weight gain quicker but that's kind of faded and in stuck in this cycle of fear because If eat normal during the day, I feel like I'll still binge at night because it feels too habitual now

I don't know. I'm too recovered to feel like I have an eating disorder but I'm too disordered to feel normal

I still have fear foods I still have rules and I still ignore my hunger constantly, I always think about food or my body 

it's so exhausting, sometimes I wish I had just starved to death"
Disordered,"how to stop purging in anorexia recovery  basically i’ve been recovering for a while now (an b/p) but every time i honor my extreme hunger or go a bit overboard i (TW!) >!purge to “feel better and so i wouldn’t get heartburn” and shit lmao🙄 !< 

i really wanna recover before school starts causr i feel like im relapsing and undoing all my progress and shit. how can i completely stop purging while trying to recover from anorexia?"
Disordered,"Hard realization today  I thought I'd been in recovery since December. Then I kind of.. looked at myself. How I'd continued gradually losing weight, how my hair kept falling out. The lanugo. The suspected anemia. Just because I was trying to eat more doesn't mean I was in recovery. I wasn't, even if the brain patterns or fear of eating weren't there, I still haven't been eating nearly enough for all this time. I kind of want to cry. Then I looked at how much it's recommended you eat during recovery and I definitely want to cry because I haven't remotely been hitting that. Like. It seems impossible to eat that much. Am I just supposed to chug whipping cream with every meal???"
Recovery,"strawberry chocolate (warning wall of text)  while me and my dad were doing groceries today we went into the european section of the grocery store and i saw this strawberry chocolate called Yogurette and i recognized some german (i tried learning it at the beginning of the year and also i watch a LOT of German movies so i know the language pretty decently for somebody with no connection to Germany whatsoever) on it so i picked it up to read it and my dad told me that he really liked that chocolate and hadn’t been able to find it in DECADES and so we got like four packs and i just now tried a piece and it was so good and i’m just. glad. we have this other strawberry chocolate called Schogetten in the pantry that my dad more or less got because it also was strawberry cream and he missed it and they had a flavour of that that i wanna get as well. and now we’re looking at the website and seeing what other flavours they had because i was trying to remember what the name of the flavour i wanted to try was (it was “Stracciatella” which from the looks of it is cookies and cream ice cream?) 

overall today was pretty good. while my dad and his girlfriend were putting groceries away i went for a walk because i had sensory overload from everything going on and i went to the pharmacy and bought a halloween trick or treat bag of little candies and i mean it’s only august so im definitely just gonna have them myself. something i’ve been mindful of lately is conversations around food that don’t revolve around health - last night me and my dad were talking about Bialys and we’re gonna try to make them because the closest store that sells them is a bagel place slash sushi restaurant (Toronto is weird like that) and my dad loves them. we’re gonna see a movie in a bit and i feel a bit tired so i’ll probably get a snack there :) the theatre we’re going to bags up leftover popcorn after the last show and people can take it with them so it doesn’t go to waste and i’m gonna grab a bag and take it home if i can >:)"
Recovery,"I've realized how much the eating disorder has a grip on me.  I've always focused on the binging and the purging but I've realized it's so much more. I've had a few weeks where I thought I was doing good or even great. Then it came crashing down and I binged and purged. I realized those weeks weren't great I was restricting heavily and once I broke that restriction I purged. It goes behind that, I think once I lose enough weight people will like me more, maybe girls would be more interested in me, I can't date now cause I'm too fat. I'm ugly cause I'm fat, these thoughts play in my head so much but now I finally realize how self destructive that is.  I need help. Gonna unload all this at my therapist tomorrow."
Recovery,"non food related recovery win  I went swimming yesterday! Something i haven't done for a while due to body image

I was skeptical when we arrived at the pool but pushed through and got in anyway, my brain was comparing my body to everyone else's around me, telling me i was bigger than everyone else and that everyone was staring at me because i look strange in a swimsuit 
I combatted these thoughts with a 'so what' mentality because i don't want to care about other people's opinions anymore

I did enjoy myself overall and will be visiting more waterparks in the near future"
Recovery,"The actual hunger  Oh my God. Before the week of unintentional restriction, I thought I was going through extreme hunger. NOPENOPENOPE. It was NOTHING compared to this-It's like that week was a trigger to my REAL hunger

I can't stop eating. I cannot tell you guys how many grapes I've eaten in the past 5 days. It is A LOT. A shitton of cereal, peanut butter, bread, crepes-everything. My peanut butter is finishing at twice the speed. I was so hungry and eating so fast earlier that I almost choked on my granola. I don't know how to cope with this. I am not at a lower weight like before either anymore so I can't even justify it to myself. I just wanna die. Please help me"
Recovery,"Compulsive exercise triggers  I would call this an “unexpected trigger resulting from living with new people” but I feel like it’s less unexpected and more just a fault of my own naivety. I’ve gone through a pretty massive life transition of moving to a new city for graduate school and am living with two other gals around my age. It’s only been a week or so but they’re great as far as I can tell and have a pretty healthy relationship with food, physical activity, and their bodies. 

However, both of them, especially one gal, are very into going to the gym/working out. A huge component of my ED, arguably the thing that started it all, was an obsession with fitness and exercise. I’ve been doing really well in the last couple of months with focusing only on joyful, experiential movement (ie scenic/travel bike riding, kayaking, hikes, scenic walks etc). But this girl talks all the time about “needing to go to the gym” and her guilt over “skipping a day” and I find myself feeling more and more compelled to take up focused exercise again. I’ll also admit that I’m not entirely *jazzed* about my body image either. 

I can tell that this desire to take up working out again is coming from a purely disordered like of thinking, but I can’t shake the guilt over not working out. I also do eat considerably more than both my roommates, so that combined with my lack of directed exercise leads me to feel like the “lazy fat one” of the group ( I know it’s ridiculous🙄) I’m trying to approach these feelings with curiosity and I plan to bring them up with my therapist next week, but in the mean time I wanted to know if anyone had any thoughts, advice, or could at least commiserate with me lol."
Recovery,"I feel the impulse to go to the gym and lift help  I was just doing yoga, pilates, abs and light cardio like 1 hour 4 or 5 times a week on top of my everyday walk to calm my excercise anxiety but it's not enough, and now I ate a tiny bit of fish and veggie's pie with normal flour apart for a tiny bit of the one with whole wheat flour and I feel so bad and guilty! But I promised not going to the gym, so I will feel guilty if I go to :("
Recovery,"Just wanted to share a nice, supportive encounter  So I was checking in for a flight in London yesterday, and I had signed up for assistance walking long distances/standing in line.

The woman checking me in and I had been chatting a lot, about my trip, etc. She told me I looked so ""healthy and vibrant,"" which was really lovely to hear, because I know I've looked very ill a lot over the last year. (This was before she noticed the assistance request on my booking, so she wasn't being passive aggressive or anything.)

We had chatted enough that when she was clarifying the specifics for the assistance I needed, she asked if it was okay if she asked what health issue I have. I normally don't answer this, but she had been so warm, and seemed to be asking out of actual concern and not out of morbid curiosity or doubt, so I decided to be open. So I told her I was in recovery from anorexia, and my body was still in a place where it gets extremely worn out if I carry heavy things while standing in line, etc.

Immediately, she held out a bag of candy to me, and said, ""Here, have a sweet!"" (And I took it and ate it then, which I could *not* have done a year ago.) And she was so kind, and said all kinds of encouraging things about how healthy I was looking (without every commenting on my body - she said it was an energy thing), and how good it was I was trying to get better and take care of myself, and how wonderful it was, and how much she wanted to share food with me, ha. She gave me tips on how to get food while I was waiting to be assisted (they don't let you stop for food on the way to the gate after they pick you up, so she was letting me know how I could get food first) because she wanted to make sure I could keep eating on my schedule. And when I left, she very warmly said that she hoped I kept taking care of myself and making progress, and that I was doing great things.

It was so just nice - she wasn't patronizing or dismissive at all; it's so common to get one of those two reactions. Just seemed sincerely concerned, then honestly sad for me that I had been through this and very, very happy and proud I was working on getting better. And she went out of her way to make sure I felt proud of myself too, even though she was about to get in trouble because there was a line and she was taking so long, ha.

But wanted to share with you all because it was so great to get some real, random support from a stranger! Def made a hard day for me much better!

**As an aside:** If you find you get weak standing for long periods, or trying to walk long distances esp. while handling luggages while in recovery, I definitely recommended signing up for this when you fly! Every airline I've flown with offers it for free - they'll drive you in a car or in a wheelchair, and let you skip all the lines. Super helpful. No one's ever even asked for proof of a health issue, and everyone has been nice about it.

**Edit:** I'm so glad this is making so many of you happy as well!! <3 <3 <3 I thought of this place right after when she was being so kind - I know we all need a pick-me-up sometimes and to be reminded there are some really lovely people out there <3 "
Recovery,to the bone opinions ?  what are ur opinions on this movie ? i personally loved it during the depth of my ed ( just bcs its triggering ) but now in recovery i hate it bc its cringe and just so fucking triggering. its also just so stereotypically. BUT this movie wants me to recover so fricking fast bc i dont want to be like this boring bitch ellen😭
Recovery,should i listen to my doc or my mum????  i asked my doc if i should eat when i´m hungry no matter how much ( i´m always hungry so maybe extreme hunger idk help ? ) and he said no. he also said that i shouldn´t eat more than >!2000!< calories ( he is a an ed specialist just saying ). then i asked my mum and she said that i should eat no matter how much i already ate and that i should eat what i want ( but she also wants that i eat balanced enough ). so i´m very confused who i should listen too..... my psychologist also said that i should not listen to my extreme hunger and only eat 3 meals and 3 snacks not more. soooo should i listen to my mum or to my doc?
Recovery,"i want to try recovery again BUT  it's so hard giving up control. i know i don't have a real ed but i've struggled with periods of disordered eating for a long time (started when i was 13, i'm 30 now), always eventually getting so food obsessed that i reluctantly go back to eating normally, gaining weight and struggling with that for a while but ignoring it the best i can.

until something sets me off again. it can be stress, or a day of unplanned restriction, or just trying to lose a few kg the ✨healthy✨way and then i'm back in it for months just to repeat the cycle.

right now i'm the lowest weight i've ever been (barely underweight bmi) and of course the mental hunger is back with a vengeance. i tried eating a little more but it's but too much and not enough because the mental hunger stays but physically i don't get hungry much and when i do, i get full super quickly. and i just really don't want to get big again 😭 i know it's internalized fat phobia but i just look so much better now, at least with my clothes on because i have crazy amounts of loose skin  (fr my butt looks like two sad deflated balloons..). it's so stupid because most of the time i think heavier people are way more attractive but it just doesn't look good on me.

i know i can't continue like this and i've been noticing more worrying symptoms lately but i just feel so stuck, like no matter what i do i can't win. i know what i have to do but this time i don't know if i can, it feels so much harder than the other times

rn i'm sitting here filled with anxiety because i need to get groceries and i included fear foods on my list but i don't know how i'm actually gonna make myself eat them when my brain just keeps hammering on about how bad the consequences will be plus the lack of motivation from having no appetite 🧍‍♂️

sorry for ranting but i have no one to talk to about this, and no access to professional help and i Really needed to let it out somewhere other than my notes app lol"
Recovery,"How to stop chewing and spitting out food?  I know, I know, it's gross. It started actually almost a year ago, and I've gained 6 kilos. I think it was because of this. I wanna stop it, but after 2 days I loose control, an I continue doing it.
Do you have any advice?"
Recovery,"Eating more, but feeling guilty  So, today I've eaten a bit more already. I have to increase my intake since I haven't been gaining weight. But I'm starting to feel guilty, even though I only ate safe foods :(

My first breakfast was a protein pudding with an apple, some granola and a protein bar on the side. I then went to sleep again and had a second breakfast, consisting of a bread roll with cream cheese, chicken cold cuts and cucumber + a black coffee.

But my stepdad brought two bread rolls for me, so I decided to have the other one for lunch. I topped it with cream cheese, cucumber and a hard boiled egg. I had a protein pudding afterwards because I was craving something sweet. 

Part of me feels like I could have just left out some things here and there, like the protein bar I had for breakfast and the protein pudding I had after lunch. 

Dinner will be my favorite: salmon and/or trout with veggies and a potato casserole (which I haven't had in a long time and I have been craving it recently)

I don't want to restrict at dinner. I want to enjoy it.
I counted calories and it's a lot already. I'm scared :( but I do have to gain weight. 

I'm thinking about doing a little workout to make myself feel better. But it would be compulsive movement, which isn't healthy in the long run. 

I've done some house chores, like doing the washing, washing the dishes and the bathroom needs to be cleaned as well, so I might start doing that after writing this. I need to distract myself. My stomach is really bloated right now. And I feel like my legs have gotten bigger as well.

I've mentioned to my mom and stepdad that I've been craving waffles lately and we might make some for breakfast this weekend. The last time I had waffles, I was still deep into my ED. My stepdad makes the best waffles ever and I want to be able to enjoy them without any restrictions. Man.. I remember him making some earlier this year and I had two with ice cream and berries. But I felt so bad afterwards that I didn't eat anything else that day. But I've changed a lot since then. Now I want to have two waffles and still have lunch and dinner. That's my goal.

I keep trying to restrict. But when I do listen to my hunger, I end up feeling bad. 

Maybe I should see it like this: The faster I recover, the less I'll have to suffer with the guilt from eating more. And in order to speed things up, I have to increase. There's no way around it.

So, if I honestly were to ask myself ""Did I eat too much?"", the answer would be no. It's just my ED that's trying to convince me otherwise."
Recovery,"Feeling like I've gained enough weight in recovery, when I'm still slightly underweight?  Title. My BMI is currently around >!17!< and I feel like I've gained enough weight.

Recovery,"Friend triggered me at work  I work at the college that I attend, so my friend who is also a student there decided to pay me a visit. We hadn’t seen each other since last semester, and the first thing that he said was, “You looked skinnier the last time I saw you.” I stared at him, started crying, and he began profusely apologizing because he knows about my ED, and he’s said triggering garbage to me before that I’ve called him out on. 

In an attempt at comfort, he decided to grab my arm...Which happens to be one of my insecurities, so I told him to let go and give me space. I ended up sitting there in silence trying not to cry on the clock while he repeatedly apologized. 

At some point, I just straight-up said, “You know that I have an eating disorder. Why the hell would you say that?” To which he replied, “I was trying so hard not to say anything triggering that it slipped.”

I was working so hard with my therapist to convince myself that my weight gain hasn’t been noticeable to anyone but me. I’ve been dealing with stomach inflammation since last year and have lost a lot of weight unintentionally because of the resulting health issues, so it’s a no brainer that I'll gain weight while trying to recover from that. 

It's still been hard for me to cope with, but I was becoming more convinced that no one else saw me getting bigger except myself...Now that's ruined. I just don't know whether to give him anymore chances. We've been friends since middle school, and I know that he didn’t intend to hurt me but god, is it that hard to just not comment on other peoples' bodies??"
Recovery,Dumb brain  Really hate that my response to feeling physically good and having energy/focus again is “ok great time to restrict and lose weight now it’ll be easy” as though the ENTIRE REASON I feel great and have energy is that I *haven’t* been restricting and have gained weight.
Recovery,"Bashed ED Today  Ordered out twice today to challenge ED rules of high caloric menu items from restaurants. 

First had delivered to me Chinese Food. Usually I skimp out and struggle but was determined.  White rice, pork, chicken, egg rolls, and chow mein instead of lo mein.  I was in heaven and I will never neglect myself of this again.  I do not exercise and do not care.  ED will not stop me from pleasure foods just because I do not ""exercise"".

Second was ordering pizza and not going diet culture style. Got deep dish with pepperoni and mushroom.  Big win and I tore through ED thoughts with DBT skills. Everyone, do not let ED deceive you with its lies.  Now, I will happily once or twice a week splurge on high caloric things that no longer represent numbers.........but tasty scrumptious heavenly life delights."
Recovery,"The entire pint  Anyone out there who developed a tendency to eat the entire pint of ice cream, or a whole box of cereal, a whole jar of pb….just that need to have ALL of something… will it go away ever? I’m really REALLY trying to honour it and have had 5 pints of ice cream in the past two weeks (like the real stuff, no diet stuff) and I just can’t fathom ever not having the whole thing. Tonight I’m having the Non-Dairy Ben & Jerrys Tonight Dough…which was the highest calorie option my store had and I still got that one!!"
Recovery,"How do you cope with doctors telling you your weight?  Everytime I go to the doctors office, I tell them ""I don't want to know my weight. Please don't tell me, show me, or put it in my paperwork."" Yet everytime, my weight is mentioned in some way or another or they put it in my paperwork they hand to me. The last time I went to the doctors was the worst of all. As she congratulated me on losing weight saying things such as ""your weight was okay before but now it's even better! Keep it up! You're getting really healthy now, I'm astounded."" Despite her being the one to diagnose me with Anorexia and seeing me at my worst. (The weight loss was unintentional and I didn't even know about it until she told me btw). 

Honestly, this all is really triggering my ED badly and putting me at risk of a relapse I feel like. It sucks because I have to see doctors often lately because medical complications/chronic issues. A lot of thoughts/feelings I haven't had in a while are coming back up and they're stronger than ever it feels like. Which really sucks because recovery honestly was feeling kind of easy I guess? To be honest. I mean it's not to say i haven't struggled and what not but I never had such strong urges to relapse up until this point. I know recovery isn't linear but jeez this sucks.

I just really want to know how to let the stupid number on the scale to stop triggering me so badly."

Logically I can see I might need a HLOC but the problem is that I’m TERRIFIED to go to resi, I love my team at PHP, and I’m convinced if I lose just a tiny bit more (>!1.6 lbs!< which would put me under a nice “even” number) that I *will* be able to stop this time. Yes I’ve said it before, but now I am on a time crunch because of my job. I’m so afraid to be honest with my therapist in program because I feel like if I was that she’d send me to resi, I can’t see my outpatient therapist right now because insurance won’t cover both, and I’m also starting to get scared that I can’t stop. I don’t even know if residential would be any more help than PHP and I’m afraid if I get sent to inpatient I’ll be tubed. I feel so stuck and I really need advice because I am having a hard time separating my healthy thoughts from my ED brain these days…

**TLDR; losing weight in PHP and afraid if I’m honest with my team there that I’ll be sent to residential, where I’ll be sent to inpatient and possibly tubed. Not sure what to do and need help.**"
Disordered,"wish people would stop commenting on weight  I’m just annoyed today. My coworker asked another coworker if he had lost weight (he had) and then went on to say he can always tell when other people gain or lose weight. I was standing right there and I’ve lost what I thought to be a lot of weight in the past two months and it made me feel so insecure that the coworker didn’t notice I had lost weight. 

I know it’s stupid because it’s just someone else’s perception and maybe it’s not noticeable because I always wear baggy clothes or maybe it’s not noticeable at all. Idk what but it really bothered me and I hate that I had such a negative reaction to it. I kept thinking about it later and I feel so bad about it. 

I just wish people would stop commenting on others bodies. Like please keep your thoughts to yourself, your thoughts on someone else’s body is irrelevant. I hate how hyperaware I am now about comments on weight and appearance.. I was having a good food day too :("
Recovery,"I slept 12 hours last night  But the potato salad I had tasted amazing. I never marked the day I actually started eating more normally - still less than it should be, but much more close to baseline pre-ED. (I have bad dental issues and digestive issues, can only do so much). I normally like to go out in the summer and spend time outdoors, especially since my spasticity from my neuromuscular condition and chronic pain lessens to the point where I can function. Except this year. (My ED started a yr ago) I am tired, all the time, sick all the time, and I have fibro and other stuff so I KNOW tired and sick. And I thought I would gain more energy when I stopped restricting but that bed is looking mighty appetizing right now and ..and I even napped for half an hr yesterday. And now its almost sept, and I did not go to to all the nice parks I wanted to, I did not gain muscle or endurance walking, I can barely walk in this heat - no one warned me of the heat intolernance ED causes. I just cant safely walk most of the time. This is not a summer issue, ever. I want to go to the air conditioned music venue with live music tonight. Its like 88 degrees in here. I wanted to go last night, too. And / or to the river, stopping on the way to the awesome grocery store with amazing pizza. But what I really want to do is read a bit and sleep. It just ..I feel like I wasted this summer, when I really only feel good and functional in the summer, and the wet cold runs havoc on my body for 7 - 9 months of the year. And I told my parents I would visit, but my mom critisized my diet over the phone, and I dont feel good. Has anyone done virtual PHP? I also need EMDR. Is there anyone to talk to? I feel so big and bloated and my family is guilting me and I know they are in their 70s and who knows how much more time I have to visit. I go in the summer because it snows 9 months of the year there and I cant walk in the snow. I was going to go in October. I just feel like a bad daugther. Yes, I have a therapist but she is a general therapist and I have thus far been unable to secure a trauma therapist or ED therapist. I had to do pelvic physical therapy today and I felt so much grief. Its trauma induced, the ED. I feel like ... everyone I know has been hurt the way I have, why am I so ..? I wont finish that sentence as its triggering. But hey, potato salad tastes good and Im eating as best I can and I'm alive. I just want to be forgiven for not being present this summer, not seeing my family, not getting over the trauma ...and I dont know why Im reaching out on here again, im sorry, its just so hard in the beginning. The hunger, fatigue, bloat, hypersensitivity to comments... i dont hardly feel human."
Recovery,"I had a big win just now!!  I recognized hunger cues!! I truly understood that I felt “off” because I was hungry and my body was telling me it needed fuel. Despite my brain screaming that I’ve eaten “too many carbs and too much today and it’s way too late at night to eat” (10pm here), I made some chickpea pasta (just the yummy pasta and sauce, not adding veggies because I don’t *have* to add them, eating plain pasta has enough nutrients & not everything needs to be green!!) 
I also had a really nice big smoothie with some peanut butter thrown in. I’m feeling really satisfied and my mood is so much better! It’s nice to eat what sounds good and tastes good in the moment. 

I’m just proud I actually picked up on a hunger cue!!"
Recovery,"I wish I could have a disclaimer so people can’t talk about losing weight or not eating in front of me  I know it’s bitchy and stupid and selfish but every time someone mentions it I freeze up, I feels like I can’t breathe, and I want to cry lol. I’m in quasi recovery right now and it’s like my brain is hyper aware of these topics. I just purposefully don’t say anything until the subject changes or brush it off entirely."
Recovery,i did so good today!  today i had 3 meals plus dessert and some snacks!! i’m not in recovery yet but today was just a good day!! i didn’t feel bad about what i was eating and i had fun making all my food!
Recovery,"Recovery is so freeing 💪🏼  Tw: weight gain mention, BMI talk 

Anyone else constantly surprise themselves in terms of ability, resilience, attitude, new perspective, etc? Recovery has made me reconsider everything about my life— food = energy = I can do things ?! And I can do whatever I want actually?!??! Who knew !! 

Today, I went to the doctor and found I had surpassed *the* number… you guys know what I mean o.o I gained past my highest weight (which was an unhealthily low weight to begin with) and… I’m not upset?? I didn’t expect to feel nothing when I saw that number, a number I’ve never seen before and also thought was beyond disgusting during ED days. I also used to have a goal BMI, like a lot of us, and one that would have literally killed me, lol- classic. And today my “high” BMI didn’t scare or bother me! 

Since recovering, I’ve been able to be ambulant and engaged in life again! I’m doing things I always wanted to but didn’t think I could, body ability wise and confidence wise. I surprise myself everyday, and would love to hear y’all’s experiences with finally, finally growing into the person you were meant to be :-)"
Recovery,"Exercised for the first time in four months and my attitude has changed so much  I did like 20-30 minutes of yoga, just a simple sequence that i used to do on my days off or occasionally for a warmup. Just did it to improve my flexibility and bc my hip flexors have been super tight lately. 

I rlly want to run or lift weights again but I won’t bc my periods still not back after 4 years and I’m also not sure if I’ve cut the compulsive movement off completely. Like it’s definitely gone but even if 1% is there I do not care I’ll wait as long as I have to so I’ll never relapse again. 

Anyway my abs and shoulders and quads r in pain. I did not think yoga was actual exercise lol I’ve never been sore from yoga. Crazy lol but nice how I can do slow movement without worrying about burning calories or “optimizing muscle growth” so that I can increase my metabolism and burn more calories while resting. It’s so great now that I don’t tie calories to movement anymore this is amazing. And how I can appreciate my body and give it time to rest from introducing new movement after not working out for months. Before I would’ve started compulsively doing yoga everyday but now I do not care. The burdens finally gone 🥰🥰"
Recovery,"Stupid pain from obsessive exercise  Okay so obsessive exercise has its drawbacks. My hip/inner buttocks really hurts, and it has done so for a few days after I felt intense pain on one of my runs. This kind of sucks, as now I feel like I need to have a smaller evening meal (I still eat, and know I need to eat, but less exercise in my head means I should eat less, which is still >!2000+ calories!<, so not exactly a dangerous restrictive amount. Still sad; not to mention I probably should relax for a while for it to heal (I think it might be bursitis, but have no clue, medically speaking)"
Recovery,"I don’t think I can do this, the guilt is even worse than before all in  I’m not even fully all in ,I know I’m doing secret things that keep me safe. But when I’m trying to listen to my body and my usual night eating is happening, I eat things I don’t even want just because of mental hunger, and I can’t go out and get those things at 1 in the morning. My sleeping is all fucked up, I feel sick(throat and sinus sick) all the time, and food usually tastes bland or gross with an even worse aftertaste. But now I’m even scared to go back to restriction because all these people on here say that they messed with their bodies so much to the point that restricting doesn’t work and fucks with you even more. I just want my brain to work again, my body can get fucked honestly but I wish I could function like a normal person and use my brain cells. Sorry to ramble, I’m just finding it hard to see the point in going on right now"
Recovery,"Win  Had 2 waffles for breakfast made by my partner. Did not ask about ingredients of waffles and enjoyed them. Spontaneous challenges are sometimes the hardest for me, but I managed this one really well 😊"
Recovery,"i love this subreddit  seriously, i’m so glad that i found it. every morning i scroll through this subreddit while having breakfast like it’s the morning paper and periodically pop back in throughout the day (mostly cos since recovery is kinda my full time job right now i’m not doing too much most days except eating, baking, journaling and going to movies lol). i feel a real sense of community here even if it’s just online and it’s nice knowing that other people are kind of in the same boat that i am in. i hope everyone had a nice breakfast or a nice lunch/snack/dinner if they’re in a later time zone. i just got lazy and had some stuff i made yesterday because i was too hungry to wait to preheat the oven or whatever but it was good :)"
Recovery,"Making excuses and tired of the thought carousels  
I am so fucking terrified of gaining the little weight I lost these past moths back plus more, I’m scared of having extreme hunger again. Plus I got pre diagnosed with hypothyroidism/Hashimotos yesterday and while googling for more info and stories of how others dealt with this all that came up was “how to loose weight despite having hashimotos” etc. and then a colleague said today that her friend gained weight while on the meds (probably increased appetite due to metabolism getting faster.. just my guess) so I’m even more apprehensive. 

The thought that I don’t need to “recover” keeps creeping in because I high restrict at (TW) >!1200-1400!< most days. I keep thinking “well a lot of non ED people probably don’t eat a lot more than that” it started with a safety rule of not eating under my calculated BMR to ensure I can still go to work do uni and all that jazz. 

But I’m just also soo done with the thought carousels and being tired and cold and irritable and having the concentration span of a piece of toast. Mhm…  toast. 

But there are so many good things in the future for me so I need to be 100% here and not in my head having silly little debates."
Recovery,"Need to remind myself I deserve food  I have been having an internal dialogue with my ED brain vs my rational brain all fucking morning and it’s so exhausting I can’t stop crying. 
I have been all in for a month and have a commitment today that is giving me serious anxiety. Because I am so anxious my ED brain is trying to convince me I am 1) weak for being anxious,  2), I a HORRIBLE human being 3) therefore, the only conclusion is that I don’t deserve food. At all. Ever again.

I KNOW I know I know none of those things are true. but fuck an ED will find and hold on to literally any excuse to convince you to use behaviors and fighting that urge is so fucking exhausting. I don’t want to give into it, I am committed to NOT give into it but damnit-I feel like I need external permission or a little push or just something to help me on this one. 

Maybe I just needed to get my thoughts out and not keep them in. I hate this disorder so much, fuckkkkk eating disorders.

Recovery,"I want to recover from anorexia  So I (21F) am trying to recover from anorexia(been having it for 6 years )but it's just so hard. I'm afraid I'll be stuck with this Ed forever and the thought of it is terrifying. My family and my bf are devastated and I feel like I'm ruining their lives tbh.Especially my bfs ... we've been together for 3 years now and for the past few months everything has been about my ed ( whenever we go out to eat or buy groceries I'm on the verge of having panic attacks because all i see are numbers and fats,the room is spinning and my thoughts get louder ,being in a place where food is being sold feels like hell;
also my family insults me for being too thin in front of him,and it makes me so insecure cuz when we get intimate I feel anxious cuz I think he might see me as disgusting as my family does;
I feel like I'm dragging him along with me into this nightmare I'm living and he doesn't deserve this,in fact,I don't deserve him )
Anyway,I've considered going to a nutritionist and a therapist but since I'm still living in a toxic household (I'm in med school in my hometown and I can't afford to move out so I still live with my parents ) it's kinda hard cuz they make me feel like a failure and whenever i tell them i'd like to see a therapist,they suddenly get upset and they are obviously ashamed of me.
I still wanna seek help and go to some doctors,but there's this though that keeps popping up in my head like ""what if they tell me I'm not thin enough to get help""(and I'm aware of the fact that these thoughts are caused by anxiety but I don't know how to manage everything)
I've also been abusing laxatives and diet pills,and every time I eat something,I just wanna get it out of my body asap so I keep taking those
I just wanna get better and finish college and start my own family ,but it's really hard to think about my future as a healthy individual since I'm scared that if i lose my ed ,I'll gain weight and hate myself again
I don't know what to do,I feel like I'm the cause of everybody's problems and that nobody sees me hurting,they all just put the blame on me (for example my mom got sick and she yelled at me saying that I'm the one who's killing her like??????????)
I feel stuck and numb and I mostly care about my bf,he's such a great man and I just don't wanna lose my best friend ..a few days ago we got into an argument and he got so upset and said ""you use me as an escape from yourself"" and ""you've taken control over my life""
Later on he apologized,telling me that he was really upset over the fact that he's afraid I might die and he'll lose me forever 
I feel broken and that my life is falling apart, I wanna get better,despite the insults about my body my parents tell me on a daily basis ,I still do want to get better and I don't need anyone's help ,I just want to be seen by my loved ones ,I wanna get healthy and love myself but it's nice to hear words of appreciation coming from the most important people in your life you know...
I just needed to vent"
Recovery,"how to not like the binge restrict cycle?  the all too famous restrict during the day eating far too much at night just to wake up in the middle of the night and eat even more

I hate it. I hate feeling overly full and gassy in the morning not to mention bloated

but for some reason I can't help but also love it. calorie hoarding until I'm with my family to enjoy a meal together, sure the waking up is annoying and I can barely remember what I'm eating now but I just can't pull myself away from it

I'm scared that I'll eat normal during the day and still go crazy at night, even if I don't wake up. I'm so tired of this cycle but its like I like it?

it's so annoying, I haven't eaten with friends in what must be months, I haven't eaten anything offered to me in months just to go stuff myself at night

and now this fear just doesn't stop. constantly worrying. weight gain , not eating enough under performing in my sport

exhausting"
Recovery,"How long did the malnutrition shedding take to stop for you guys?  I had a shed period during my initial recovery, then it slowed down. Then I had a medication related relapse and started again, so my hair has just been like. Falling off my head for months it feels like. I have baby hairs coming in and I'm taking so many supplements and using anti thinning shampoo, but it's so hard. On Monday, I kept track the entire day and counted 262 hairs leaving my head. Literally fuck anorexia."
Recovery,Epiphany  i’m writing this after having two evening snacks (or arguably one big evening snack spread out across twenty minutes or so) fairly quickly after dinner and realizing that like my mind’s concept of “too much” is totally skewed because of Literally having an eating disorder and the only real way to assess too much/enough is to go by like the way my body feels. if i’m feeling dizzy every time i stand up or if i’m a basket case by 3pm or if i feel like i’m on clonazepam a good half hour after a meal than there’s a good chance i haven’t eaten enough and need more. i barely care about calories anymore because i know deep down i’m not eating anywhere near minimums (i’m still unlearning a lot of restrictive habits…) and my body needs literally all of the energy it can get right now to keep itself running let alone to actually heal itself. i care more about not having headaches and being able to muster up the energy to go on a five minute walk to the pharmacy than i do about what a toxic part of my brain thinks.
Recovery,"snack challenge/so much progress!!  I am about to wrap up a summer in treatment (PHP and IOP), and I just made myself a scary, large snack for my PM snack. Of my own volition, without anyone making me do it. I knew what I wanted for my snack, and I had it! Even though it was the higher calorie choice!!!!

PM snack is often hard for me because I make choices based on what I ate earlier in the day. Ending treatment has been a bit scary because I am still very much not cured, and I'm worried about relapse/how I'll handle life without so much structure. But it's little moments that feel like such big wins to me. I'm not sure if I could've done this a few months ago, and for once I feel excited and not embarrassed or scared to admit this progress :)"
Recovery,"Mom  I have been eating more for the last couple weeks or so. Today I started to feel more energized and called my parents to maybe fly up in a couple months, I felt too unwell to visit this summer. I reminded mey mom that due to needing lots of dental work I am soft foods only. She asked me what I eat and I said I do eat spaghetti with soft meat and canned / soft vegetables, she told me ""Thats a lot of carbs."" I snapped at her that I'd lost X amount of weight and I don't know what the h\*\*\* she wants from me. And now I'm regretting telling them I would go. Because I forgot that aside from feeling as unwell as I ever have in my life this summer, by far... that I just can't handle her monitoring my intake, this woman literally saw me eat practically nothing the weekend she visited and we were at olive garden and she said my weight loss must have been medication related when I asked for a second bowl of soup with the soup and salad lunch deal. She will deny it but she is the one who encouraged me to lose weight as a child, who made me wear baggy clothes when I was HWP, who made me hide my baby fat and shoulders, and commented always on what I ate. She poked my body to see how much of it was fat. She resembled Jamie Lee Curtis in body type, but I do not and I cannot, my hips are wideset. I ... wanted to see my siblings. But god, if her asking me what I can eat sets her off so I snap back and then she gets off the phone, I just dont know what to do. I lost so much weight. I wish she wasn't my mother. I have a better role model in my bf's mom for unconditonal love, but its soo hard to always be judged on what you do or dont do, and how you look and it never matters. Im 6 inches shorter than her, im not going to resemble her. But damn if she didnt make it a lifelong mission my whole life that she wishes I had."

Recovery,"Fearing the amount of food I am going to eat.  I’ve been all-in for a little over three months and I’ve been doing really well. I’ve let go of all my food rules, have faced all my fear foods and eat exactly what I want, when I want it, and as much as I want. 

However, I still wake up every morning and dread how much I am going to eat that day. I’ve had extreme hunger for three months, but my appetite has decreased slightly these last few weeks, and it has only made these thoughts more loud. I still listen to all my cravings and give my body what it wants, but my ED brain still sees less food as a win, and it is seriously hindering my recovery and making my mental hunger more extreme. 

So, I just want to hear if others have experienced this, and how you overcame it?"
Recovery,"extreme hunger questions / general reflection  day i think 16 of my all in attempt and i have a question. i think i might slowly be working my way into extreme hunger. im finding that after a meal - even one that’s “objectively” “filling” (high in fibre and/or protein) i’ll be some combination of hungry, exhausted, and dizzy - more often the latter two but sometimes hungry as well. i do fill up pretty quickly, so i only really need something small (like a little cupcake or a couple of cookies - i like to bake specifically so i can have something sweet to easily grab) but i need that very quickly after a meal. as “scary” as the prospect of extreme hunger once was to me, i’m not really all that worried about it now - more food means more energy and at this point i’m so exhausted that getting more energy can’t be a bad thing. i’m only really curious about the logistics. i know i have a lot of mental hunger - both in general “thinking about food all the time” and more specific cravings - which are much more rare so it’s hard to honour mental hunger because i never know what i want. my only real concern is having to spend more on groceries / do more trips cos shit is so expensive lol. 

i’m still kind of stuck in a rut of eating a lot of my “safe” foods or “diet” versions of foods - halo top (i’m sorry but it tastes good and i love the texture), baking with stevia instead of sugar, 0% yoghurt, etc. i do genuinely like a lot of these foods is the thing - you’ll pry my protein pancake mix out of my dead hands. imagine like one of those gym tiktok “recovery” influencers are who peddles “diet” type foods but minus the gym part because i barely have the energy to even walk anywhere anymore. i more or less constantly feel like i’ve just taken ambien and am about to fall asleep lol. 

at some point hopefully today i’m gonna go to the store with my dad and stock up on stuff i have been specifically craving - mostly childhood foods i’m randomly nostalgic about (was anyone else obsessed with annie’s pasta shells as a kid) or stuff im curious about (has anyone tried strawberry cream cheese? i’m so curious!) and maybe even a little treat that i’ve been scared to have (maybe a small cup of gummy peach rings…)"
Recovery,"trying again at recovery, struggles  Relapsed into restriction, which I was clinging to to give me something to feel good at but causing EH and mood disruption.

Started seeing a dietitian who is knowledgeable about eating disorders and she's having me eat something every three hours. It's hard. When I eat something my brain immediately wants to binge, and I get antsy. I'm trying not to binge, but it was easier when I was restricting. I'm just writing this because I feel unsettled and I'm trying to remember why this matters. 

It's also making me think my metabolism is super fucked up because when I eat regularly like this, now I'm feeling tired when I normally wouldn't and have energy when normally I wouldn't. And my digestive system has no idea what to do. Having food does make you want to have food, like if I don't eat now my brain is like... Why no glucose. Give me glucose.

Anyway just feeling weird but I'm trying, idk"
Recovery,"weird moment of clarity but still struggling  I just got back from a two week vacation. I lost quite a bit of weight before from restricting, but then it was unexpectedly easy to not restrict during vacation. I fed my body well and ignored the stressful thoughts (I even had ice cream!!). Now that I’m back, everything is so stressful again and I have a strong urge to go back to my old habits. 

But, I just realized I gained very minimal weight during vacation despite eating so so much compared to before. I was so so sure I had gained weight and now I don’t know what’s real. 

I’m not underweight and I guess my body is okay at this weight. But I still want to lose weight and restrict despite knowing it’s going to make everything so so much worse.

I’ve been in recovery from anorexia for about 3 months and it’s been a super hard and tiring journey but I’m finding lots of small wins (just got my period back!!) Anorexia took lots of friends away from me because I was always scared of going out and eating food with others. I lost a lot of friends and now I find myself with a dry phone and not many friends to talk to. I have two really close friends but they don’t go to my school they graduated. Im scared of going back to school and seeing my ex girlfriend too. She was a huge motivation for my ed.. I’m scared of seeing her again and my old friends. I don’t even know how to make friends I’m so scared of going back to school and being alone again. I can just see myself eating alone in the bathroom or something sad like that. I feel so sad and anxious. How can I make friends? How can I have confidence in myself and how can I stop thinking about my ex?

I planned on eating lunch in a cafe, but I chickened out again and got a protein pudding and melon, as well as a protein bar. I couldn't stop thinking about having cake or ice cream though. After fighting my ED thoughts for an hour, I finally got up, found the nearest cafe and got two scoops of ice cream (cookies and tiramisu ❤️.. in a cone!) And I'm so proud of myself! I wasn't hungry at all. But I wanted to challenge myself.

I actually feel pretty good right now. I hope this won't change until dinner. Because dinner will be one of my favorites: stuffed bell peppers (stuffed with minced meat) and rice.

This subreddit has encouraged me to think deeper about why I do this and maybe take more steps towards recovery. Thank you for existing.
Recovery,"?  If you go through the intake process for treatment centers and they recommend residential, would you believe them? Or are they trying to profit?"
Recovery,"What are some of your recovery hyper-fixation foods?  For me, it’s cereal and bananas! And crazily enough I HATED bananas until a year ago! I currently have 6 different cereals - all with specific uses and sometimes I combine them. Curious to hear what others are fixated on right now, maybe I can add something new in the mix! Haha"
Recovery,BROKE A FOOD RULE  this is such a minor thing but i have this thing about eating late at night and if i know im gonna have breakfast early in the morning but i had some toast with peanut butter and it was good :) and this was AFTER having an evening snack. i also had several unplanned snacks today (which was literally just strange shit my dad bought and put in the pantry while i was staying at my mom’s house lol)
Recovery,"stunted in height  hi, i have a question!!!
i’m currently 151cm (4”11) and 17 years old. i developed anorexia at age 7 and only entered recovery last year, so it’s stunted on my growth a lot. my feet are also abnormally small, even for my height. i’ve been eating good for a while and my electrolytes and vitals are slowly getting back to normal. 

my sisters are in the 5”5- 5”7 range. is there any chance i can grow any taller/have my limbs grow? can it be fixed with improved nutrition or is it too late?? 

i’m not too bothered about being short (at least i’m alive lol) but was just wondering. thank you all in advance!!!"
Recovery,Concise for the Ed is a conceise for me basically  They aren’t letting me have my phone bc of this which is bs my mom agreed to this to but what they don’t understand is I’m not my Ed like wtf a concise for the Ed is a concise for me which is bs bc there treating me like I’m the bad guy and not my Ed wtf
Recovery,family meals  as much as i love preparing my own stuff (i cooked a lot while restricting it’s nice to relearn how to prepare food so it’s something i LIKE as opposed to making it as low calorie as possible) some days you are just exhausted (i’m exhausted most days probably not eating enough 😟) and it’s nice knowing that you can just eat the food that you’re offered without actually worrying about the calories in it or whatever. also a lot of the anxiety over ingredients just kind of goes away when you’re not present in the kitchen. same reason why i like local restaurants but with the added benefit of i don’t have to pay for it 😁
Disordered,"How to deal with uncomfortable feeling after eating  So I've been doing really well this past week, trying my best to eat all 3 meals and often snacks as well but at the end of the day I often get this uncomfortable feeling in my thighs, this tingeling sensation. I know that it's irrational but it's like I can feel myself gaining weight. I'm having that feeling right now and it's triggering me so bad. How do I deal with that? How can I distract myself? Right now it's making me want to skip lunch tomorrow"
Recovery,burritos from chipotle slap so hard when you’re in recovery  that’s it. that’s the post.
Recovery,Challenged my ED today  I challenged my ED today by getting something my disorder deemed as 'unsafe' and I feel proud.
Recovery,my sister makes recovery so hard  my sister is constantly telling me i’m fat and that i’m bad at having anorexia. i almost died in january from this illness and she always tells me she wishes i had. when i eat a meal she’ll purposely start on me and tell me i’m fat and of course the meal doesn’t happen. she’s 22 and i’m 19. it’s just hell. there’s nothing my parents can do because she just sticks her fingers in her ears and screams. she’s bullied me for years. she did this a couple of nights ago and it’s been so difficult to get back on track since. the people i love have been trying to assure me that i need to keep going because i’m already at risk of being sectioned again but how on earth can anyone keep going in this situation. i’m so exhausted with it. my brain bullies me constantly without her actually saying those things. i can’t keep going like this :(
Recovery,"'Wanting' to feel sick  This is weird. I've eaten a ton this morning, and honestly I feel really good. But I feel like I should feel physically sick from eating so much. I almost want to feel sick. Does/did anyone else get this feeling in recovery?"
Recovery,"Back on track  Today I ate more again. Did I feel good about it? No. But I have to get back on track. 

For breakfast, I had two protein puddings, a sandwich and an apple. 
At school, I wasn't hungry, but the girl I hang out with (idk if I can call her a friend 👉👈) got pastry from the bakery, so I decided to buy something as well. I didn't go for pastry though and had a bread roll with scrambled eggs, lettuce and tomato instead. It was good, but I felt sick afterwards. I don't know why. Maybe because my mind was going crazy. I felt so guilty for eating. So dumb.

When I got home, I had another bread roll, but I was too scared to put anything on it.. so I ate it as is, which wasn't too boring since it had lots of seeds. I had another apple afterwards.

Dinner was soup. I helped my mom prepare it yesterday and we used lots of fatty meats to cook it with. Knowing that, the soup was very scary for me. I had a portion, though it was rather small. I had another bread roll with it (very German, I know lol) and an apple for dessert. I usually have ice cream after dinner, but I can't bring myself to have it today.

My mind has been in a weird place lately. I didn't even eat that much today, yet it feels like a lot. I had chocolate as a night snack yesterday and woke up really bloated. School has been triggering as well.

I'll try to do better tomorrow. I have some time before school starts and I'm planning on having lunch at a cafe. Maybe cake? Or waffles with ice cream."
Recovery,"What hobbies have you rediscovered since recovering?  EDs take a LOT of brain space. Have you rediscovered any hobbies since giving up the ed ""hobby""?

Recovery,"recovery starts now, i’m over this!!!  i’ve been on this giant 2-day binge bender. i feel like a food addict. but i promised myself to not purge, and i haven’t! i’m also done with these binges. recovery starts today, no more restriction (which i know is causing the binges). right now, i’m eating breakfast and just allowing myself to eat."
Disordered,"Recovery meal plan - how the fuck do I cope  So I'm in recovery. I need to gain weight, and so I have started a meal plan consisting of 3 meals + 3 in-between snacks. 
I'm super motivated and I am willing to gain, but it's still tough as fuck.

How do I get my body used to these amounts of food? Moreover, how can I be truly at peace with eating that much & gaining? 
I'll be thankful for any advice"
Disordered,"Day 5 All-In! Plus some questions about drinking in recovery and permission to eat  So after considering/researching recovery the last two months, I’ve finally committed to all-in recovery since last Friday. I was going to wait till my birthday on Sunday so I could “save up” calories for that day one last time, but I realized that was just my bullshit ED voice. I know I’m still very early in but I found that I’ve been doing surprisingly well so far? My mood changes a lot, one minute I’ll be feeling disgusted with myself and guilty, the next minute I’ll be feeling excited for recovery and proud of myself for saying fuck you to anorexia in so many ways. I think part of the reason why I’ve been able to go through with all in is that I’ve been visiting family this past few weeks, and they have been holding me accountable and eating with me. I think it will be much harder when I go back home today and am alone most of the day until my boyfriend gets home from work. One thing I have been struggling with is feeling like I need permission to eat. For example, last night I accidentally saw the calorie label on the cheesecake I was eating and I called my bf and asked him “if I should eat XXX calories of cheesecake right now”. Also I’ve been feeling the need to tell him exactly what I eat and sending him pictures of my food. Another thing I’m worried about is slipping into my past habit of alcoholism…. Before my Ed took hold, I was a daily heavy drinker. I’ve drank everyday since going all in, some days more someday less. It has been helping me eat more and feel less guilt, but I know I need to stop relying on alcohol during this process. If anyone has any experience with/ advice on managing drinking during recovery and needing permission to eat, I would love to know. 

Side note: it’s only been 5 days and I’m already pooping regularly again!!! I thought I fucked my bowls up by taking too much miralax and senna tea, but who would have thought you have to actually eat enough in order to have proper BMs!"
Disordered,"confused about weight gain  what I don’t get is I’ve gained like 2.5-3 pounds consistently for the last week or so . they weighed me at my 2 appts the last 2 weeks and told me by accident so like yea I’m still Uw according to ""bmi"" but I’ve gained some so how can I not be feeling better yet?? Cuz I’m not eating much more; So maybe it’s water retention from inflammation? And when I say not feeling better I mean Like I don’t feel more energized, if anything my symptoms are worse like my dry skin, headache, no hunger, feeling weak, etc And I’ve been colder too recently, So like I don’t get how I’m getting all these symptoms yet am up 2.5-3lbs consistently for the last week or so from my lowest"
Disordered,"Stabbed in the heart  My partner admitted today that he’s not sexually attracted to me anymore because of my weight gain (binge eating disorder), and that he’s more attracted to his other partner (poly relationship).

I don’t know what to do"
Disordered,"So hungry  I'm back from my week long trip to Korea, since I don't eat pork it was very difficult to find food there, so I was undereating on most days (also sleeping very little)

Now that I'm back to my home I'm so hungry, I keep wanting to eat and I just don't feel full at all, I know this is normal but it is so difficult to accept and honor it all especially after the unintentional week long restriction which now feels like the norm"
Disordered,"Anyone else with sinus/throat issues in recovery?  Since going all in, my throat constantly feels like it’s trying to get sick, my nose always feels dry from blowing it a lot, and I feel like there’s lots of stuff up in my sinuses. I already have messed up senses that make food tasteless or very bad, and this weird half sick feeling makes it worse. I have lots of mental hunger but it is hard to honor it when I feel this way and I know that my food will either taste like nothing or taste bad. Plus, because I have a sweet tooth and sweet foods are things I can taste the most, I have it in my head that consuming them is making me sick because I’m not eating enough variety. It makes restricting sound like an easy escape"
Disordered,"I’ve been doing well and it scares me  Like the title. Been doing surprisingly well lately. Challenging fear foods, breaking rituals and food rules….and on one hand it feels good. I have more energy. I feel more present and fun and productive at work and with my family. I’m reading again. 

On the other hand I can tell my body has changed a bit. Not drastically and I don’t weigh myself so I don’t know for sure. But I’ve passed from Scary to Normal in the mirror and it terrifies me. All the reasons I want to look sick and small are still there- I feel overwhelmed and inadequate as a high functioning/NT passing autistic. Work is stressful with lots of changing demands but I’ve never worked another job and I feel unable to. My physical health sucks. Family is stressful. I keep falling into emotion eating and eating past comfort after stressful days which scares me. And I can’t get the voice out of my head that says everything would be better if I looked like a famine victim.

Disordered,Growing taller?  I had an eating disorder in a important developmental year of my life. I haven’t had a period in over a year. I feel like I’ve caused irreversible damage to my body and I’ll never grow like my peers. My main concern is that I won’t get any taller. I’m 5’2 and 14 years old. I want so badly to be taller but I’m scared I’ve ruined everything. After having an eating disorder did anybody ever grow any taller or get a growth spurt or did it forever stunt your growth? I’ve been in recovery since June 1st and the only thing that’s happened is major weight gain and bloating. Will I ever have a normal puberty and get taller? What is your personal experience with this is you have one?

Disordered,"documenting my ACTUAL recovery day 3  forgot to post yesterday again but yesterday was alright but not the best.

after day 2's ""binge"", i felt really awful mentally and physically. i still made myself eat breakfast although i struggled, but i made myself some french toast and even though i felt physically full and probably could have just not eaten it, i was mentally still starving and ate so many slices with whipped cream and syrup and everything. it tasted amazing but it felt like such a binge.

after breakfast, i knew i should have had a snack between breakfast and lunch but i felt so much guilt still and skipped it so then by the time lunch came, i was mentally and physically SO hungry. ended up clearing out all of my leftovers, then made a pot of mac and cheese and was still hungry so i finished pretty much an entire package of oreos. and then i still kept snacking, idk why even. i really did feel full but i couldnt stop. i really think that skipping the morning snack, even though i felt full, led me into a crazy binge. and the binge lasted the entire day until literally midnight when i was so exhausted i finally passed out. and then i woke up in the morning like in those movie scenes where the character wakes up surrounded by random people and is super confused, except i woke up with stomach pain, intense guilt and being surrounded by a ton of crumbs, wrappers and containers. :\\

i'm trying to forgive myself for yesterday but it's hard. i know it's extreme hunger but i feel so alone and i feel like i'm bingeing.

but i'm learning that it's becoming way to hard to try and restrict and if i do restrict, it just makes me legitimately binge afterwards. i should just give into my extreme hunger and just let it pass but it's so hard. the binges are so much worse and so much less enjoyable and even though extreme hunger FEELS like a binge, i know it's just the ed voice saying that.

i guess since i've been a binge eater previously, i should be able to know the difference between a true binge and extreme hunger but my brain is just distorting all of that and its so stupid."
Recovery,Ate breakfast and a morning snack  Okay day 15 of “all in” which basically just means day 15 of not having myfitnesspal on my phone because I’m still struggling a lot but today I had breakfast and I also had a morning snack :) usually I just end up waking up late and not bothering but NOT TODAY!

Recovery,"included trigger foods in breakfast  today was the first day that i was able to 1) eat breakfast before school, 2) i included 3 foods that usually triggers a binge in the breakfast and 3) eat a snack at school all in one day. small but important victory for me"
Recovery,"A little update  Hey, so I haven't updated in a few days. I just haven't been doing well and I didn't want to share my negative thoughts... But I'm trying to stay on track.

Yesterday was my weekly weigh in with my mom and I'm really starting to dread those, since I'm not gaining any weight. And she's starting to lose patience. She suspects I'm doing something to lose weight behind her back, but I'm really not.

But I have to admit, these past few days I really wasn't honoring my hunger. I was so scared for some reason. And I already knew that the number wouldn't go up before I stepped on the scale. Honestly, these weigh ins aren't doing anything for me. They don't trigger me, but they do build tension between my mom and me.
We're doing it to track my progress, but what progress? I've stayed at the same weight for over a month now, with some fluctuations here and there. 

I'm starting to believe that I'm not meant to gain any weight. But that's just my ED trying to give me dumb ideas. I know I'm not in a healthy body.

I have been eating less. And I haven't been bloating, as a result of this. I wish I hadn't looked in the mirror. Because I loved not being bloated. And I don't want to build the connection that not eating=not being bloated. I have to eat anyways.

Today I'll have my blood work done and I'm not supposed to eat anything 8 hours prior to that. My appointment is at 8 AM. I was so scared that I'd be starving when I wake up, but I'm actually doing just fine. I do feel a bit light headed. So no bike ride to work for me today, I'm gonna take the bus. And after my appointment, I'm gonna eat breakfast. I won't fall back into restriction.

I've noticed that my hunger cues go away when I eat less. I thought it'd be impossible for me to restrict again. But now it seems a lot more doable. But I can't. I shouldn't.

I have to stay strong. I'll give myself some more time. If nothing works, I'm considering going inpatient. It's not a pretty experience. But I don't trust myself right now. Maybe it's what I need in order to recover."
Disordered,"Does extreme hunger depend on length of ED?  Hi All - so I’ve had disordered eating since spring 2020. It started as more EDNOS before it spiraled and I was diagnosed with anorexia in November 2021 (been restricted since June 2021). I just started really working toward recovery and am now eating nearly double what I was two months ago, but I’m starting to be absolutely insatiable!! I wake up every single night to eat more. I can’t restrict if I wanted to. I’m wondering if extreme hunger is still common even if you haven’t struggled with restriction that long? Does length of disorder have any correlation with length of extreme hunger? Feeling so out of control and scared. I am incredibly bloated, getting shit sleep, and have edema, not to mention gaining weight nearly all in my stomach area. I know all of this is normal for recovery, but everyone I see has struggled with restriction for multiple years. It’s making me question is this is really extreme hunger or if I’m just using it as an excuse to eat and eat and eat…"
Disordered,"For how long did you experience fatigue during your recovery?  I understand that it's different for everyone, but I am wondering how long it took you to stop feeling recovery fatigue?

Edit: intro of the first sentence."
Disordered,breaking food rules  this is the hard part for me. i just can’t bring myself to get past my rule of having to wait at least twelve hours between eating my last thing of one day and my first thing of the next day. preferably longer. it’s hard cos i get hungriest late at night but i just can’t bring myself to :(
Disordered,"experience with pregnancy and ed?  Title states the obvious. First time in 23 years I'm actually eatting probably normal.. obviously when this happens your body grasp on to the weight, couple that with being pregnant.... it's debilitating... the anxiety. My SO doesn't understand/know the extent of my past/current Ed issues. I belive he's ok with the weight gain but he is also someone who wants his girl to look good.. and to someone like me that means skinny. I don't want to do anything to harm the baby and that's why this is probably the first time I've ever eaten what is considered normal. I still lapse time to time but I think I'm doing good.

My question is.. how the fuck can I not obsess about my weight. I'm to the point where the scale isn't helping ( in the past that's how I controlled/kept healthy weight. Daily weigh ins to know how much I needed to fall into Ed behaviors) I haven't gained much weight 4 to 8 pounds. Which isn't bad considering the body getting used to nor divulging in those behaviors. 
But I think I may need to get a measuring tape to measure my legs and arms vs my stomach to make sure the weight is only going where it's supposed to.... does it even work that way?

Any help or tips on how to stay sane. 

I reached out to my doc for a Ed specialist to look into therapy but I know that will take years ans years of work . I need to know what to do now. I'm going insane with weight worries. And I'm so fearful of fat and I feel so freaking huge and ugly.

Disordered,"I'm now the heaviest out of all my siblings and I'm struggling - advice?  I visited my family over the weekend, and really really tried to have fun, but all I could think about is how my body is bigger than my sisters', and how I looked the worst out of us. I grew up with 2 older sisters and my whole life we have been pushed to be competitive with each other. the only things I could ""beat"" them in is having a smaller body. but now, in recovery, I have the biggest body, and it's a shock and very difficult. 

my partner reminded me that my sisters love me for how I am, I shouldn't compare myself to them, and that recovery is the most important thing. that kind of resonated with me, but I'm wondering if anyone else has any advice for  how to work through this mentally."
Disordered,"Recovery and exercise  So I know in recovery you really shouldn’t be doing any exercise in order to let your body/ mind heal, however how do you go about ‘necessary exercise’- I live on my own and don’t drive so getting to the shops etc means I have to walk there. My local shop is about a 10 minute walk, so it’s usually pretty easy, however it doesn’t sell everything I need. Issue is the other shop is about a 40 minute walk away. 

I don’t go to this shop often, however I usually find that when I do, the ED thoughts get so much louder, saying that I shouldn’t compensate for how much I’ve walked by eating more because ‘that would be a waste’. Should I eat more on days I exercise more? Should I just stick to what I normally eat? 

Also I find that in the days after I’ve gone to the shop, I find it so much harder to rest/ not exercise. I know I’m order to restore a healthy relationship with exercise I need to fully rest, but that’s just not possible for me. Can I still restore a healthy relationship with exercise? Or should I just hurry up and get my driver’s license"

Disordered,"Friendship advice  I've been in recovery from restricted eating/binge eating/sometimes purging for maybe 5 years and it's still not easy. I'm still triggered sometimes by social media. Sooo.. people that I follow are my friends and only influencers that makes me feel good. I control what kind of content I want to have in my feed so it can only be kind to my mind. The only thing is, I have a friend (one of my best friend) that's always in bikini posting pictures and we can see that nothing fits her because she's really tiny and that's fine, the only thing that really triggers me is seeing her ribs. Always. And that's the biggest trigger for me. It makes me not want to eat for the rest of the day. I feel super uncomfortable and I kinda start hating her even if I love her. I don't know if that makes sense?? I feel like a terrible friend even though I like her picture and say nothing but it haunts me for longer than i would want. She posts pictures where we can see her ribs literally every day. I can't unfollow, she's one of my closest friends and it's silly but I'd feel bad not supporting by her liking her pictures. How can I avoid having negative feeling towards her, not feel bad about myself and still being a good friend?

Disordered,"Falling back into old habits/night rituals  I’m an f19 recovering from a year of a restrictive ED which is now beginning to morph into a bulimic/BP form.

The BPing started happening around April this year when I started eating more through an OP program. Unfortunately the EH that hit me was so overwhelming and (unlucky me being able to hands-free purge) I got into the habit of purging when I felt even slightly full or guilty for something I eat. 

I’m a singer and have committed to a year of study overseas at a prestigious music school but can already feel some fatigue/damage in my voice because of this habit and it stresses me out so badly which then makes me overeat which then makes me purge. Queue the cycle restart.

I recently went on a family trip where I managed to clean up my habits somewhat and was having a lot more regular and monitored meals but now that I’m back home, I have a lot more freedom to eat secretly/skip/restrict meals and I have started throwing up again. Today I tried really hard to eat throughout the day honouring every single craving and I finally felt like I was experiencing totally unrestricted eating, but the moment I get home I HAVE to stop at the pantry out of habit (I think maybe I’m subconsciously scared of going to bed hungry?). At first it starts as genuine hunger but once I’m going I’m GOING and won’t stop until I feel like purging.

If anyone out there has experienced this habitual night eating and has any tips to break it or manage it I would really appreciate some advice, kicking this thing just feels fucking impossible."
Disordered,losing weight in recovery  this isn’t me asking for any sort of guidance beyond “eat more” which i should be doing but i just am kind of frustrated by it. it’s not actually all that much weight (literally like >!0.2 lbs!<) so it’s entirely possible it’s just water weight from the initial increase in food tapering down a bit but it’s still really really really discouraging :( i know i’ve been really struggling doing all in but unless i can do inpatient (my city only has an outpatient program that has a bmi cut off of >!16!< because anything below that would require more consistent medical monitoring) it’s basically the only option i have. i have a referral in for inpatient but it’s such a small program and not even based on my hometown so idk if i can get in.
Recovery,"1 month in recovery  Today marks 1 month in recovery for me. One month ago I was miserable, consumed by my ED and I was barely surviving. But 1 month go I also took the most important decision : I decided it was time to recover. I decided that I was worth it,  that I deserve to live a fun life. And one month later I can say that recovery is f*cking hard and sometimes feels impossible but I know that it's worth it. I have so much more energy, I'm able to laugh (for real), to joke, have a conversation with people... Simple things that I didn't have the energy to do before. My family and friends are so happy to see me actually living again. And I'm so proud of myself to have taken the path of recovery. I still have a very long road before I reach full recovery and I'm going to challenge my ED even more every day."
Recovery,"I finally challenged pasta, my biggest fear food ever!  Pasta was my biggest fear food for such a long time and after a year into recovery, today I was finally ready to try it again. 

So I just cooked it, improvised a kind of tomato and mushroom sauce and… just ate it.
And guess what? I’m still alive, I didn’t gain lots of weight instantly and I feel amazing. 
It was really delicious and I can’t believe I restricted myself for so long from something that’s so yummy! 

This showed me again that I have to challenge my (irrational) fears step by step and one day it will all work out.

I’m really proud of myself right now!"
Recovery,balanced diet or eating what you want ?  what do you guys think is better ? when i goggle how to eat in recovery i only read that you should eat a balanced diet and not too much sweet stuff but on sites like reddit i read that you should eat whatever you want so what do you guys think ?
Recovery,"How Do You Take This News?  My Clinician just informed me ""Congratulations, you reached your goal weight restoration.  Now you can taper back.""

Even at age 32 I feel like now this means I cannot eat what I want, whenever I want and am in such distress."
Recovery,"Trying to convince myself to keep eating today  Sorry this is long, there’s just multiple factors and I need to justify them all in my head 
I’m 2 weeks at All In, finally talked to an actual Ed recovery coach who held me accountable and called me out on my shit. Told her that it’s been difficult because I’m attached to the routine of ED so she said to start a schedule of eating every hour, actual scary food every time, along with real meals. Yesterday was first day and definitely didn’t eat huge scary things every hour but still challenged things and felt better and even more hungry.
Today went to lunch for moms birthday, but driving and waiting took longer than expected and I didn’t eat for more like 2.5 hours, my body was all sick and anxious and ready to just not eat at all or get salad, but I knew I would just feel sicker and stupid so I got a veggie burger. Wasn’t good bc the patty had onions in it and covid decided I don’t like onions anymore but I forced myself to eat it. 
Since then I’ve felt so much guilt and like a failure in every which way. Now I’m making my moms birthday dessert because that is my gift to her, and I just can’t imagine going near it tonight, let alone eating at every hour  plus a meal. I know the coach did this to show me how hungry I am and that it’s not something that has to be perfectly followed but like, if I can’t do this, and I can’t do constant spontaneous things, and I cant  do a meal plan that’s restrictive, how am I gonna recover"
Disordered,Addicted to cereals  I've been eating almost a box of cereal a day for the past two weeks. Why are they so good :').
Disordered,"Help me feel like these are wins?  Ok so it‘s been a kind of big week for me (and it‘s not even over yet!). I still don‘t really want recovery yet but I am trying to at least make some small changes. 

So in therapy I vowed to put away my scale and I actually did it! It‘s down in the cellar without batteries. I did weigh in at the gym and at work once but I hope I can leave that be too (especially as the number will never be as low as it is when I get on first thing in the morning at home so it‘ll just stress be out more). 

Secondly - also in therapy - I deleted my calories log in my phone notes. I had deleted the app two months ago and now this is the next step. I still use my phone calculator but at least without writing it down I can’t do as much pre-planning. 

And lastly today after I already used up all my calories for the day I was still hungry and it only took me the whole drive and walk home (lol) to convince myself to have some  Jogurt and Muesli so I won‘t go to bed hungry. Now I feel pretty stuffed which sucks and I‘ve been bloated the whole week anyway (Idk why - It couldn‘t possibly be copious amounts of diet drinks? Nooo never.. ). I feel like a failure but in a way I know these are baby steps in the right direction. 

If you‘ve read this far: thank you! Also a question if you like: Does anybody else get panicky when you get hungry? Like I still have hunger cues (cue me feeling invalid) and when they come I‘m like oh no here comes hunger to f me over.."
Disordered,"Why am I never satisfied???  It just seems like no matter what or how much I eat I’m never satisfied, I just want to eat more and more. Is this normal? Will I ever be able to eat and actually be satisfied?"
Recovery,all in day 4 update  today was all in day 4 and i ate ALOT. i feel very guilty for it and i feel bigger then usual. i ate the same things as usual but i also snacked alot. its hard to accept that my body needs this but i´m scared that i end up eating like this when i´m weight restored and get overweight ( i dont want to say that its bad to be overweight!! ). tomorrow is a new day and i will still try to honour my hunger.Even tho its hard i still try to remember myself everyday that no food will harm me as much as my ed does.
Recovery,"Do I have an ED? I don´t know what to do  TW: Numbers

I've been restricting for almost an entire year. I lost my period 7 months ago and I'm a little underweight (not severely though as I'm 97 lbs at 5""2). I had been sticking to a strict 700 - 800 kcal meal plan for a long time.

As a result, I'm tired all the time, can't get any sleep, have no energy and have been really depressed. I had my first appointment with a psychiatrist. She referred me to a dietician. However, I'm not able to talk to her yet because the appointment is two months away. I can´t wait that long. So a couple of weeks ago, I decided to try to ""recover"" on my own, because life has become so miserable that I'm willing to take matters into my own hands.

I've managed to slowly increase my caloric intake. I started eating a little under 1200 kcal. Granted, I'm not very consistent and haven't reached my maintenance calories yet, but somehow I feel hungrier and more tired than ever? Like, I´m really hungry. Is this extreme hunger or just an urge to binge and should I give in to it? I've been considering ""going all in"", but I feel uncomfortable not having a professional to guide me through this process. I want to start recovering now, but I'm not sure if what I'm doing is right, or if there's a serious problem to begin with? How do I cope with this extreme hunger and the fear of gaining weight?"
Recovery,"A day of eating; with scary, delicious, unplanned ice cream  I have eaten a good sized breakfast, lunch and dinner today, and planning on filling up my bowl with chocolates and candy (big bowl, can fit a lot of candy) and drink real hot chocolate like I do every Saturday. BUT: I was just spontaneously invited to eat ice cream, and had 2 scoops, and the girl who scooped the ice cream literally put 3 scoops and called it 1 (so I got like 5-6 scoops - which were delicious. Thanks to that young girl for doing a phenomenal job at her part-time job).

I feel like I shouldn't have my planned candy, but I am going to eat it because I want it and have been looking forward to it. At least I'm doing what makes my ED hates, eating a lot of good foods. My ED is of course calling this a binge, but how can it be a binge if I **want** to eat it, and I conciously choose to do it?"
Recovery,"Getting called “Healthy”  I have gained a lot of weight recovering from ed, and now people keep saying i look “healthy.” I was severely underweight before and I understand I was not healthy, and now that I am healthier, it makes sense why people would call me this.

Yet still it is the most triggering thing ever. Back in mind I still want to look “unhealthy” and I hate my “healthy” body. I want relapse because of it, but honestly I don’t think I could restrict myself even if I tried because I have lost all the control my ed had. 

Literally just 10 minutes ago my mom showed me all the comments under my back to school photo, and I swear every other one was “Oh, she looks so healthy!” 

tldr : In my mind I think i’m associating getting called healthy= getting called fat (on my body only)

This is really just a rant post but if anyone has any tips to combat this, anything would be helpful!"
Recovery,"running as an (recovering) anorexic  im maintaining/gaining weight rn. ive never been a runner but i feel an urge, for non-anorexic reasons, to try to run the ___ minute mile that i never could in middle school PE. i’m just scared if running will harm my body or if i’ll collapse during it. as i’m stretching preparing for it, it’s like i can feel the oncoming heart pain, but then again, isn’t that the point of me beginning to run?"
Recovery,"Unintentional Weight Loss in Recovery vent  Sigh....

I'm about a month into ACL surgery recovery & 2ish years ED recovery. Before my surgery, my dietician and I talked about her concern that I'd lose weight. I am committed to my recovery and told her I planned to not let that happen. ..... And... anyone wanna guess what happened? Oh, you already read the title.. right.

Anyways, I'm struggling. I was at an okay weight before surgery. But it dropped a little in the first 2 weeks, and I could only weigh myself wearing the brace so it seemed like less than it was. I was a little worried and vowed to work harder to try to get it back up. And since then I think it has only dropped.

I'm staying at my parents house during this recovery time so I've not been able to use a consistent scale, which is another reason why it was harder to spot the weight loss. Today I finally got to use my normal scale, the one I've used to report to my dietican for years, so thats the one we trust and go by. Anyways I step on it with my knee brace & shoes on, and it was low. my heart SUNK bro. cause I knew without the brace & shoes it was bad. So I took them off and went again and almost cried when I saw the number. I felt an instant cloak of dread. But at least I didn't feel happy, I think theres usually a SMALL part of me that feels happy/excited when the number is lower, and i think this is th first time it was only dread. That thought tho did make me happy for a second, cause it felt like progress. 

However, now, I'm going to have to make a lot more progress to get to where I need to be. I have so many reasons to be in recovery: I have a life again. But every bit I lose it just seems harder and harder to gain it back, and I get further and further away from the goal post, which is when I feel discouraged and like I should give up (\*give in). which is so not what I'm going to do right now, I just get so scared that since the voice seems a lot closer than it has been. I can't give in but it feels like running through quicksand."
Recovery,"How do I prevent a relapse  I’ve been dedicated to recovery since June of last year, I did relapse in January 2022 but I decided to recover again in May. I’ve been doing fantastic but there was a minor inconvenience when I was on a holiday (idk what I’d call it, let’s say a mini heartbreak) and my brain can’t find a way to cope besides returning back to my toxic habits. The only other thing that’s keeping me distracted is drawing and weightlifting but when I’m not doing that my head is screaming at me to starve because I’ll feel something other than sadness. 

What do I do? I don’t wanna relapse I’m so proud of myself and the progress I’ve made :("

Recovery,Extreme Hunger?  So today i decided to stop trying to restrict even if it’s not meal time. I ate everything I wanted and even challenged a fear food and a food rule today! but for the most part i feel so hungry and it takes like 800 to fill me up for a little. is this EH or just me eating right?
Recovery,"I need help  Hi, 
I’ve been struggling with ED for a few months now since starting puberty and it’s been really hard I’ve had to go to the hospital several times and I was really sick for about a month where I could barely hold any food down. 
After a couple days at the hospital getting liquids and anti nausea meds I was put on a liquid diet and slowly go better. 
But a couple days ago I had surgery on my knee and recovery has been very painful and coupled with the strong painkillers, has left me without an appetite again and hardly able to stomach even the idea of food. 
I’m trying to get into therapy and get into a recovery centre but until I can make that happen I could use some support.

Recovery,"Feeling mentally and physically tired...  Hi everyone! I am one month into committed recovery and it has honestly been so challenging.  Recovery feels like a full time job! 

The feeling I have been having the past couple of days,  but particularly today,  is that I am just so tired and want a ""break"" from fighting so hard and just go back to my ED for a day to get relief from the constant voice in my head that I need to keep challenging and the feelings that come up throughout the day.   I also have complex trauma so when I let go of the ED all the feels I have been trying to avoid come flooding too. 

I am in treatment for an ED and trauma and my therapist is amazing. It's just a long week between appts! 

So I guess I am just wondering if I am alone in these feelings and if not,  what do you do or say to yourself to keep going on those days where physically and mentally you just feel drained from recovery?"
Recovery,Advice Needed!  So I tend to find myself restricting when I get really stress out or down.

If you have any advice at all how to help me through this please respond. Thank you!
Recovery,"Gallstones from weight loss-anyone else?  Does anyone else have gallstones from rapid weight loss? My doctor does not feel I need to have my gallbladder removed at this point because I haven’t had a major attack. It’s sore daily but nothing major and they said the gallstones are tiny. For those with gallstones from weight loss or for other reasons, do you limit your fats or do you just listen to your body? I guess this would depend on whether you are having surgery or not too. Just kind of curious if anyone else has gallstones but just persists with fats and it has worked itself out."
Recovery,No appetite but want to gain weight  I have no appetite and find it tedious to eat. Almost all cravings went away as well. Yet I have at least 20-30 more pounds to gain. Is this normal and do I just push through this or eat a certain category of foods more that might spike appetite? A lot of foods are kind of turning me off that I’ve enjoyed yet I want to gain weight. **I know some might say this is a body dysmorphia thing and that subconsciously I don’t want to gain weight but I actually do not have anorexia and I lost weight due to illness and difficulty eating. I’ve always loved food and I like my body at the higher end of my healthy BMI. I literally just have no appetite but I know I have to persist***. Any ideas?
Recovery,changing food tastes in recovery  has anyone else experienced this. i think i’ve consumed more chocolate chips in the past week or so than i ever have in my life before lol
Recovery,"Dating apps and poor body image  So I have body dysmorphia, no idea how I actually look. I keep telling myself I’m bigger irl, and that I’m catfishing guys on dating apps because I don’t actually look that cute. I’m terrified to meet up with a guy in case he thinks I’m a whale or that I intentionally lied to him. How can I stop this? Or does anyone relate?"
Recovery,"I hate how small things can send me into a spiral  So I’m on and off recovering from anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating (separate from the bulimia). And fucking hell. I hate how easily something can send me down the rabbit hole again. 
I was going through tiktok and saw a video where this guy was doing a family fued skit. The topic was “We ask overweight women, what their weight was.” 
The first answer was “uh, 180?”
Something so small. Sent me into frantically searching the house for a scale to weigh myself.
After not being able to find one I went online and thought about buying one to hide in my room. 
THEN, I went down the route of looking on sketchy websites for diet pills and steroids like DNP. 
Even ended up looking on insta for posts about DNP and asking people how they got it…I hate this shit.
Something so tiny triggers this obsession with weight. Idk, I just needed some place to talk about this where I didn’t feel like I’d be shamed or judged."
Recovery,"calories as energy  okay this sounds so mundane but it made me think… yesterday i was at a grocery store with my dad and it’s one of those stores that has foods from all over the world (with a particular focus on europe and asia but also good amounts of african and south american stuff) and they had this iced tea or some other kind of beverage that was low in calories and it said “LOW ENERGY” in big letters on the can and honestly that made me kind of think for a second. iced tea being low in calories is whatever because you know tea is just leaf water but when it comes to actual food the idea of something that’s LOW ENERGY being healthier is so insane. even ignoring that calorie counts are slightly imprecise anyways it’s crazy how like diet culture and stuff has twisted “energy” into a bad thing to the point where my attempting to recover from anorexia ass is still kind of fretting over calories as if my body doesn’t need energy to function. 

i assume most people reading this who are on this sub are either trying to recover or have recovered from an eating disorder and if you’re in that situation than your body almost certainly needs as much energy as it can possibly get."
Recovery,"my mom thinks i get motivated to eat by bodyshaming me  Hi. Just a stupid rant, but i want to get it of of my chest

so my mom thinks i get motivated to eat more or recover faster by bodyshaming me. For example, i was feeling insecure about how i looked a few months ago and she said:"" but you also don't look pretty right now, you'd look way better and healthier if you'd gain some weight. And she's said multipule times how i didn't look good or pretty right now. When i said i didn't really like it when she said things like that, she said she was just stating facts.

 I get that you shouldn't compliment people with an Ed on their body since it can fuck with their mind and stuff, but offending them isn't okay either, right?

And for some reason, she's constantly reminding me of what other people may think of me. When she found out about me purging, she said:"" you know your dentist and orthodontist will notice that, right? You will be so ashamed."" And she also said things like ""What will the people at your new school think? trust me, you really don't wanna be known as the kid with an eating dissorder."" And when i asked if i could hang out with some friends i hadn't seen in a long time she said: "" But what will you do when they comment about how much weight you've lost?knowing them, they'll definitly do that. I'm just speaking the truth, everyone can see how thin you've become""

it makes me feel really bad. Like I should only recover because of others but not for my own sake (which i already kinda feel like because i want to recover so my parents don't get angry at me.)"
Recovery,"Question about maintance calories  I’m weight restored, my period started 2 months ago. Now my school starts and I need to prepare my food in advance. Till now I had extreme hunger and I was sitting at home so I was eating around 8k calories but it ended when my period started. Calorie counting is not a trigger for me. I’m getting back to my workouts (now pilates) but I want to now approximately how much should i eat? Any calculators? After eating not enough to have a period, and around 8-10k after and not having hungers cues yet I’m completely have no clue. And intuitive eating is not a solution because I need to cook for myself for a whole day."
Recovery,"feeling hopeless in recovery and clinician saying I can’t gain?  I’m currently in an outpatient eating disorders program that’s part of my state’s mental health unit. It involves checking in with my clinician once a week where we do a weigh in and undergo CBT based therapy. I also check in with her every Tuesday and it also involves seeing an ED dietician every few weeks. I log everything into recovery record. 

It has been nice to have such a support system to talk things through with and challenge some ED thoughts and behaviours. I’ve been able to increase my calories (but a goal so far hasn’t been to be able to stop counting totally). I’m already in week 4 out of 10 of the program and feel no where near reaching complete food freedom. Last week I have myself mostly the freedom to eat whatever I wanted and honour my hunger (but tracked all days). I’m not sure how to do the blur feature but it ended up being 2500-3300 calories a day. This week I’ve found myself back to restricting again (high restriction). 

Today my clinician mentioned that it’s not the goal of the program to gain weight (apart from normal fluctuations of up to 2kg). This totally took me off guard because she keeps encouraging me to eat more and I’m like well if I eat more won’t I gain?? Isn’t that a normal part of recovery? 

I mean, so far I haven’t gained any weight with each of the weekly check in’s we’ve had which has come to a surprise to me since I’ve been eating more. I’m classified as underweight. 

I feel discouraged and ever since increasing my intake I’ve been ravenously hungry and feel especially bad giving into extreme hunger now knowing that she would have to “call in her supervisor” if I gained more than 2kg in a week. 

This is supposedly a program that has been backed by successful research. I feel discouraged because I’m pretty sure this is the only program for eating disorder treatment in my area that isn’t just ED based psychologists."
Recovery,"Ate to much, i'm gonna explode  I'm almost at my third month of recovery and still experiencing extreme hunger everyday. Today was pretty intense, I was craving chips and I bought one bag and I ate it all, but that didn't bothered me.

I'm scared that I'll gain a tone of fat tomorrow and since i'm weight restored, the fear and guilt is worst. I feel like it's not normal to continue to eat that much, especially if i'm weight restored (even though I know that BMI is bs). Anyway, I just came here to write this, i'm feeling lonely and all of this scares me a lot."
Recovery,i cant stop thinking about peanut butter  i bought two jars of skippy creamy pb & one jar skippy super chunk.  I cant stop thinking about making peanut butter sandwiches and how i’m going to dip them in apples. Even though i literally just went through 2  jars in less than a week. like i have to include pb in every meal i have bc i feel like something is missing. it doesn’t feel the same w/out pb 😫

Recovery,"Struggle with mind - body  This may sound weird, but does anyone else have trouble with mind - body “connections?” 
Sometimes I have a hard time speaking, I drop things, and sometimes visual overstimulation (ie. Bright lights + lots of stuff happening) makes me dizzy . This started around a month ago, when I started recovering, does anyone else have this problem? Its especially bad if I haven’t eaten.

Recovery,"Being impatient is hard  After struggling for a couple of months and ending up at a anti suicide facility I'm now at a place where they treat eating disorders.

The people are really nice but other than that I feel like I don't belong here. Because of my autism I don't get group therapy, I only see a shrink two times a week . That's it.

Eating is horrible. You have to eat with 12 other people who are all having a different ED as I have. Most are crying when the food is served and others are doing 40 minutes about a plate I clear in 8 minutes tops. It triggers my ED making me doubt the validity of it or I am doing it wrong? After everyone is done eating you have to wait another 30 minutes. The food is also extremely safe. At the suicide facility I tried many different things even though it was scary. Now I'm eating potatoes with a safe kind of vegetable everyday. 

This was supposed to be the final chance but I'm honestly not sure this is helping. Because of my autism I have trouble expressing emotions. All the attention goes to the other people who don't have any problems with that.  I'm not sure what to do anymore.. besides sleeping, those 6 eat moments and walking I don't have any interest in other things I used to like.  

Ps. Once again, the people and other patients are nice. It's not their problem. It's most definitely mine"
Recovery,"I feel like I ate too much and didn't excercise enough  I'm being forced to eat a supplement called ensure that is really hugh cal.

But trying to prove I'm trying to recover after I only had a fruit with tea in the afternoon when I was supposed to make a complete meal andcmy bff got kinda mad I had a dense breakfast today (that ensure stuff with coffee, a rice cake with PB, which usee to be kinda safe to me till today, and half an apple) and had more calories than I thought. And now I ate two slices of homemade broccoli and spinach pie with a little bit of lettuce and carrots, and I was really craving veggies pie and since my grandma made it it felt safe enough to eat the two slices (she cooks very very healthy, her foid almost always is safe food lmao the only safe food apart from the one I do myself) but I can't really know how many cals it has and I feel so so full. Also, this week and almost the entire one before I couldn't go to the gym bcs I was told I could get impatient and got scared, and I promised not to go. Iv'e been walking no less than 8000 steps everyday and this week I began doing yoga, pilates and abs work at my house almost everyday but it doesn't feel enoughto burn or ""earn"" everything I'm eating, especially the ensure, I hate it so much is not even tasty. And I think I developed a weird addiction to 0 kcal sweeteners like stevia or splenda since I don't consume sugar and I discovered how sweet it taste tea and coffee with it without the calories problem, and I have a big sweet thooth, but I also know that artificial sweeteners aren't healthy at all and make me so bloated...sorry, I needed to rant somewhere, recovery hasn't been easy :("
Recovery,i rely on my scale  when i weigh myself and it’s on the lower side i know it’s a green flag to eat a little more. whenever i don’t have access to my scale my brain literally will just use it as an excuse to restrict “just in case” :’( i went on vacation and LOST weight (not a lot) because i had two unsupervised days where i just skipped meals bc i thought the other days of eating compensated for it. i hate my scale obsession and i hate how ill die without it.
Recovery,"Day 10 + 11 of going all in  I was too tired to write yesterday, so I'm summarizing Day 10 and 11.

Yesterday was really stressful because of work. I made lots of little mistakes and got more anxious with every one of them. We have a surgeon who visits us for special surgeries that our dentists can't do on their own/can't do very efficiently or risk free.
I've had to assist her lately and I'm still not used to her way of working. She let me know whenever I made a mistake. And because she was very stressed out as well, she didn't have the nicest tone.

And it got to me after a while. I wouldn't have been too affected by it on most days, but I've been going through a lot mentally and it all tipped over. I broke into tears (of course not in front of the patients), when a coworker talked to me. Whenever I'm on the brink of tears, I'll start bawling once someone talks to me haha

I calmed down very quickly though, they told me that they make lots of mistakes too and that everyone still enjoys working with me. I love my team ❤️

Part of me wanted to use this stress as an excuse to restrict. I did eat my lunch though. 

But when we all sat down together to discuss something, I didn't join in on the snacking. Only after being offered something multiple times, did I bring myself to have a piece of a meatball, a gummy and some grapes. Which felt like a lot to me at the moment, but now I realize it wasn't much and everyone else had more than that.

Dinner was my favorite: fish ❤️ That made up for the awful day a bit.

Today was a lot calmer. Our surgeon was in a better mood and I didn't have to work with her much. 
I did have a lighter breakfast and lunch. But I snacked on some grapes at work, as well as a piece of candy.

I got home maybe half an hour ago and my mom is in a bad mood. I wanted to start making dinner right away, since I have to leave in half an hour from now and I won't be able to eat dinner until 8pm now, because we only started making dinner. 

So I had a pain au chocolat my mom brought from work. And I already feel guilty about it. Now I don't want to have dinner anymore. We're making a pasta dish with instant sauce and I read the nutritional label. It's so high in calories... I'm scared. 

I've been in such a bad mindset these past two days...

My mom and my stepdad might go on vacation next month, for a week or two. I'll be home alone with my two brothers and I'll be in charge of the entire household. My ED is thinking that this is the perfect opportunity to restrict. I hate it. I won't take this. I'll use it as an opportunity to cook fancy dishes instead! It'll take courage. My ED is the loudest when I'm alone, left to my own decisions. 

Anyways, I hope I can enjoy dinner today."
Recovery,"Confused and struggling  My mental and physical hunger still isn’t back. My ED is now telling me that because I have more energy even tho I haven’t increased cals and that because I feel more fine and experience symptoms like lightheaded less than normal means I’m fine and don’t need to eat more even tho I haven’t gained weight, the veins on my feet are blue, the veins on my hands are the same and well as my palms and I have dry skin everywhere; I def have soreness in my legs too. It’s summer here and I’m wearing long sleeves all the time."
Recovery,"I have hunger cues but I don’t feel like eating  That’s it. 

I’m working on getting better and some days are better and some others are not so good. 
I’ve recently observed that in the past few weeks I tried to listen to hunger cues but I simply can’t eat: it’s not about counting calories or anything else, it’s just… food sits in my mouth, it doesn’t appeals or satisfy me at all, even things that I used to like or I used to crave. 

Everything taste bad, I tried change my diet and new tastes and spices but nothing is good 

I’ve being eating even less than usual and I spend hours on the same meal before even finish the first half"
Recovery,"Feeling like a failure rn  I had 7 snacks within a 2 hour period of time. Part of the failure is counting the snacks, since I'm not supposed to be doing that in the first place. Even though I'm supposed to be eating more that just feels so wrong for me. And sure, they were small snacks, but I still feel horrible"
Recovery,first day all in and cereal  yesterday was my first day all in without counting calories and doing exercise. it was hrd and i cried alot ( like fr i cried all afternoon). it was 7pm when i stopped crying and i know that i could have restricted and my stupid ed voice told me to not eat anyithing. but guess what ? i made myself a big bowl of cereal AND after that i was still hungry ( extreme hunger ???) so i made myself a nutella toast and an cheese toast . it was my first time that i ever heard to my hunger. did i feel guilty ? yes. Was it woth it? HELL YEAH
Recovery,"taking time off uni  I’m in my second semester of full time uni and also work around 15-20 hours a week. I started recovery about 3 weeks ago and I feel like I’m definitely spreading myself too thin… the approach in the program that I’m in at the moment isn’t “all in” and I find myself both physically and emotionally exhausted. 

I’ve had such a hard time accepting that I need a break and not being incredibly “busy” all the time because I know that’s probably the eating disorder trying to distract me from recovery/eating. I’ve always been an overachiever and I wanted to push myself to finish my double degree early/get ahead by doing winter/summer terms too. All I can think about is food and honestly some days even beginning to honour my extreme hunger feels like it consumes my entire day. Or, since increasing my intake I’ll get hungry every hour or so and challenging my ED thoughts is such a distraction and I feel like I’m falling behind. I’ve also fallen into a bit of a depression which makes it harder to face everyday and makes me incredibly tired. 

I know it’ll probably be better in the long run to take a bit of a break (I’m doing 4 units at the moment and want to drop to 3 - dropping anymore than that would make me feel like a bit of a failure and like I’m falling behind :/). Just looking for some advice/stories of those who have undertaken recovery whilst in uni."
Recovery,"Avoid Relapse Advice  Lately, the thoughts are so strong and I just really need encouragement from people that get it. Every time I see pictures of myself pop up from a year ago when I was at my LW it just makes my body dysmorphia insane. I have gone all-in and am weight restored after 2 years of struggling and I just don’t know what to do the days I feel so so bad about my body. I love how strong I am now but it’s like my head won’t stop criticizing how I “let go” of what was once killing me. I just need help in conquering food guilt now that I’m the weight I was when I decided to start disordered habits."
Recovery,"extreme hunger and set point weight  i’ve been in all in recover for almost two months now and i’ve recovered enough to reach a healthy weight. i’m pretty much where i was pre-ed, when i had a healthy body and regular periods (which i have yet to gotten back). i dealt with extreme hunger pretty much every day since starting recovery, but i’ve barely had an appetite lately. it’s so weird, because i had multiple days where i would eat literal pound after pound of food, no problem. there was one day where i ate a family sized bag of cool ranch doritos, six donuts (yes, six), like three bagels, and half a bag of cereal. i have no idea how the hell i managed to down all that because lately, a single meal satisfies me completely. i still have cravings from time to time and often think about food, but it’s not nearly as obsessive as it was before. i almost feel normal. could it be that my body decided it was done dealing with extreme hunger as soon as i reached my set point weight? or could it be more physiological, and it’s just me convincing myself that i don’t need to eat ‘extra’ anymore because ‘i don’t need to/shouldn’t gain any more weight’? just need a little help understanding this because i find it odd that i was ravenous a couple days ago and now food barely excites me."
Disordered,"A few thoughts on quasi-recovery and getting older  So today is my birthday and I can't help but look back at the past year with a sense of loss. I feel like I lost most of the last year (and a few years before that, if I'm being honest) to my eating disorder. I can't stop thinking about what could've been if I was healthy. Mostly, I just want this period of my life to be over.

I don’t remember most of my most recent relapse. All I really have is the hazy impression of constant headaches and just waiting for the day to end so I could do it all over again. However, I remember the months after so well that the memories feel painful. I was picking my way through the ruins of my life— a sick body, a failed relationship, a personality I didn’t recognize. And I was in pain. Constantly being in conflict with my body hurts. Feeling emotions after being numb for months hurts. Losing access to coping mechanisms hurts.

I never really chose to recover— my body began to heal because the immediate stress triggers in my life went away, it got harder to restrict, and the extreme hunger was overwhelming. I stopped most of the disordered behaviors without addressing the underlying issues motivating them. I felt trapped in a spiral of quasi-recovery, wanting to restrict to deal with the reemergence of my emotions and wanting to recover to resolve my health problems and stop the overwhelming guilt every time I ate.

And there’s been so much anger. Anger that I’m uncomfortable in this body no matter what size I am. Anger that every meal is an internal battle. Anger that has been misdirected at others for noticing or not noticing enough. I don’t want to be a bitter person hurting others and myself.

I, like a lot of people with EDs, struggle with all-or-nothing thinking and perfectionism. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about this quote from *To The Lighthouse*:

>The great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark.

I kind of wish there were some moment of reckoning, some point where I resolved to dedicate myself to being better forever and that being the end of it at last. We all know it doesn't work like that. Truthfully, I’m not sure I’m even ready to choose full recovery today. It’s a terrifying, uncomfortable unknown and and god, do I like the feeling of control (lmao). But I’m twenty-one years old today and I refuse to lose another year to this illness. I don’t need to continue hurting for the pain I’ve already felt to have been real. 

This has been a bit rambly but what I mean to say is that this year, I'm going to believe that time can be a chance for growth rather than a thing to be lost. The little miracles will come. I’m gonna keep going, and I hope you will too :)"
Disordered,"stomach problems in recovery?  so maybe this is tmi idk but im currently at the beginning of recovery and i am having some annoying things occur which i’m not sure if they’re symptoms or not.
1. ik constipation is a symptom as well as bloating (both of which i’m going thru currently) but my stomach makes so many weird sounds now? like i’m not hungry so it’s not hunger grumbling yet my stomach is just making sounds and it’s kinda embarrassing tbh. 
2. my other thing is that whenever i burp (which for some reason is a lot now that i’m in recovery? is that normal too? i feel like i’m full of air or gas for some reason) it’s like burping after drinking carbonation. idk how else to describe it but it’s like got the burn that u get after drinking soda and burping i’m not sure y tho. i don’t rlly like soda or carbonation in my drinks at all so idk what else would cause jt? r these normal recovery symptoms?"
Disordered,"balance is bullshit! i think. right?  *for context: went to residential, significantly beyond weight restored, experienced extreme hunger at start of recovery but have been eating at or beyond recovery minimums for months* 

most of what i eat is processed ""junk"" food or high-fat, high-sugar foods: chips, chocolate, pastries, cookies, fries, you get it. it's just what i like eating. i'll have some fruit or something when i crave something fresh, but most of the time i just like snacky, junky food.  i had some of these foods at residential, but the dietician always told us ""these foods are part of every diet- *in moderation.*"" she also preached ""a balance of protein, fats, and carbs,"" which makes sense- except the foods that i genuinely crave now are mainly carbs, with fats as flavor. in my ED i tracked protein religiously, and i don't want to end up like that again. but is it okay for me to eat like this? even long-term? how long will it last, if other people have experienced this?"
Disordered,"I literally just want to eat cake all the time  All I want to do is eat cake. Like vanilla cake with fake vanilla frosting. That’s all I want to eat and it seems like that’s all I’ll ever want to eat. I bought a lemon cake over the weekend and ate all of it. I want more cake. It seems weird to just stop what I’m doing and get cake, I want to be free from food and it feels like I’m still controlled by it."
Disordered,"how do I return to normal eating?  after 3 years of recovery, even significantly weight restored past my pre-ED weight, at a weight and BMI I thought i’d never get to, I’m eating all the time. most of it processed, high fat and sugar, and definitely not “healthy”. I’m gaining weight at a rate even faster than I was in residential, which honestly doesn’t make me jump for joy. I’m outgrowing my clothes practically faster than I can buy new ones. but even though all of these things are happening that are making me unhappy, I keep eating. why? I don’t know. sometimes I wish it were different, that I ate a strict 3 meals and 3 snacks, that I wasn’t always hanging around the kitchen eating just because I can. am I doing the right thing? my dietician in residential wanted me to eat more mindfully and stop to monitor my hunger, but I’m scared that my ED would just use that as an excuse to mentally restrict. No one’s even forcing me to eat this much; I eat 3 regular sized meals with my family and then go crazy grazing on snacks throughout the day. even when I’m anxious or conscious of my body I still eat like this. it’s not physical hunger, either, it’s almost like a habit that I couldn’t stop unless I really forced myself to. 

I feel slightly guilty, but i don’t know if my eating habits will normalize, and what that will look like"
Disordered,"the new curves dilemma  i know a lot of people here are either actively trying to regain their curves or are just happy with their boobs/butt etc etc but dude for me it is the exact opposite

even at my lowest i still had some curvature and i despised it so much. having gained enough weight to be normal now means i’ve also gained fat in the exact places where i feel people stare at me and it DISGUSTS MEEEEEE

this is gonna sound odd but i used to look borderline like a guy with the right clothes on but now it’s obvious i’m a woman and i hate the attention i get. please. why can’t women ever win."
Disordered,"struggeling while also trying to be a supportive friend  Hi. 

So im struggeling a bit. I have a friend with an eating dissorder. She told me the first time we hung out, and i've been trying to help and support her with her recovery since then. But i've gotten an ed too, and I'm really at my lowest point right now. None of my friends know about this including her.

I especially struggle with telling her since i don't want to trigger or hurt her.

She really wants to hang out with me and eat diner with her at her house, but thats pretty difficult for me because she (unknowingly) triggers me alot. I feel really bad for not texting her first for a while, but she often talks about really heavy stuff, which ofcourse, i want to help her with, but its just really hard for me too.

 This all is obviously  not her fault, and i want to be there for her, but i also need to think about myself. Does anyone know what i can do?"
Disordered,"DAE get winded af and dizzy super easily doing light movement?  It's been since Dec/Jan I've been ""All-In."" I gained \~40 lbs (just recently weighed myself for the first time since starting and omg idk if it was worth it lol). 

Anyway, I've also been depressed so haven't walked more than to the bathroom and kitchen for months (I quit my job and I haven't seen any of my friends or gone out). I used to overexercise a shit ton (walking, weightlifting). 

Anyway, today my dad was helping me move a couple things out of a college house I'm in rn. I got hot, sweaty, dizzy, nauseous, and genuinely felt like I was gonna throw up or pass out. It was brutal, nothing like how I remember moving in (in August 2021). The house actually has two units and I'm in the upper one which means the back door in on the second floor and you have to walk down a flight of stairs to touch cement. So, like it was a few trips from the house down the stairs to the car, but I was dying by the second walk up the stairs. 

I don't get it, shouldn't movement like this be easy? Like, why was it easy for me when I was at my worst?"
Disordered,"social media and ED recovery  Can we please talk about social media and ed recovery? Social media can be so triggering sometimes with its fucked up algorithms.

 For example: i was looking on Tiktok for some motivational edrecovery accounts. Followed some accounts, liked some things etc. Next thing, i go on my fyp and its filled with , weightloss tips, body checks even pro ana videos (with the most triggering things ever like ""portionspo's, thinspo's, unhealthy weightgoals, toxic wieiad, calories etc). The same goes for Instragram!

 I'ts so weird and upsetting. I try to block all those accounts or click ""not interested"", but it is honestly so triggering. So weird how they don't delete those posts"

Disordered,"Relapse while trying to be a supportive partner  I’ve been recovered or recovering from my ed for over 3 years after struggling with it for most of my teens and young adulthood. I thought all my disordered behaviours were a thing of the past. I was finally able to be in a loving relationship which was something my eating disorder was keeping me from for a long time. I’ve talked about my past struggles with my girlfriend and she knows that I use to have an eating disorder but have now built a stronger relationship with food and with my body. I’ve never been this happy and healthy.

But I’ve had a slip up with food restriction and purging while she’s been away. The first one this bad in years.

My girlfriend is going through a tough time because she lost a family member and had to travel to her home country for the funeral. Since we found out, I’ve been trying to be as supportive as I can since I know she has a lot on her plate. She’s been away for a couple of weeks now and it feels like I’ve been hiding things from her, mainly how I feel my ed rearing its ugly head again. I feel like the secrecy is making it worse but I don’t want her to worry about me because she’s already super stressed about everything else.

I’m afraid not telling her about the slip up will endanger our relationship and make me full on relapse. But I’m not sure she can take worrying about another person right now.

Any advice on preventing a relapse or protecting my relationship would be appreciated!"
Disordered,"I hate how normal diet culture is  I know this isn't a super hot take in this sub, but the way people casually perpetuate diet culture blows my mind. 

All the time people at my work just casually say ""I had a cheat day"" or ""I gained 8 pounds during my time off"" or ""I need to detox."" Like??????????

It's so fucked up and especially as someone who struggles with ED behavior, it's so jarring to hear. I've tried my hardest to remove any language like that from my life and hearing it used so casually really sucks."
Recovery,"i’m turning things around  today started off awful. after breakfast, my mum said that we should check my weight and it turned out i’ve reached a new low. that once would have made me happy but now i’m just worried for my health. so i’m committing to recovery.
i went to Bross Bagels with my mum and brother for lunch, i got a sesame seed bagel with a ton of cream cheese and smoked salmon which was a huge fear food (particularly all the cream cheese) but knowing that i needed to gain weight made it a lot less scary. and the bagel was fantastic! and then i got a vegan oat milk chocolate bar! i will recover from this."
Disordered,"Has it ever turned out to be more than just amenorrhea?  Still working through recovery, have gained weight, haven’t gotten my period yet, and it’s been a little over two years since I’ve gotten one. 

I started taking birth control for a hormone boost and have gotten one “fake” period and my doctors & I are hoping that my body will regulate itself over time as I continue to take the hormone supplements. 

I can’t help but start to get paranoid that there’s another underlying cause that has compromised my reproductive system because I now weigh more than I did when I got my last natural period. Has anyone ever experienced a similar thing and gotten diagnosed with a separate condition and/or left infertile? Or do I just need to be more patient with myself and potentially gain more weight?"
Disordered,"Every time I think I’m fully recovered, I realize another toxic behaviour/mindset of mine  Didn’t know what to flair it as, but could be seen as triggering for some so idk.

As the title says, I always think I’m fully recovered until I realize some of my old behaviour or ways of thinking are still there in some degree. Like wanting to be petite or feeling like crap when someone close to me (that’s usually more attractive 😬) becomes more petite than I, I feel kinda shitty.

Then I feel shitty for even having those thoughts.

Then I feel even shittier because I realize I’m not fully recovered."
Disordered,Night Sweats  is this just a general recovery thing or is it specifically a sign i’m not eating enough? it’s not the most unpleasant thing in the world (i find the headaches and getting tired easily much worse - and much more obvious signs of undernourishment) i’m just curious. lately i’ve been waking up every day drenched in sweat lol.
Disordered,is all in worth it?  hey its my second week in recovery and i´m still  in quasi recovery and i kinda want to try all in recovery. i´m scared to eat too much and gain too much and too fast weight so what are your experiences
Recovery,"DAE think about food LESS when hungry?  
My digestion and hunger signals are pretty out of whack and I can go days without feeling anything recognizable as PHYSICAL hunger, but those days are always filled with weird intrusive thoughts about food—“are you hungry now? Are you sure? Does this sound good?” 
But on the days when my physical hunger signals are coming, it’s more like “oh! This is definitely hunger!” And then I eat and the whole thing is more or less over with. 
Does anyone else experience this? How to make it stop?"
Recovery,"What's Your Favorite Food? Why?  Any stories associated with it?

For me it is definitely chicken nuggets. I'm 32 now, but I still find these as the ultimate happy place for me.

What about all of you?

Super"
Recovery,"Not able to restrict in recovery... recovery win?  I've noticed something while in recovery and that it that I find it harder and harder to restrict. Even if i have plans to restrict (like telling myself im only gonna have certain foods this day) later on I just give in and eat what I want to. I know I shouldnt be restricting while recovering but what I've noticed from my previous attempts to recover and now is that I would find it sooo easy to fall back on ed behaviours before and now it's getting much... harder. My ed grieves this and tells me i'll never be able to relapse and i was (still am) scared of it.
But i think this is the reason why. My ed for the most part has been fueled by the intent to harm myself. When I started i knew exactly what i was getting myself into yet willingly went through with it. In every sense, it was like i ""gave myself"" an ed. And the reason i found it so easy to relapse before was because that drive to harm myself never really went away. But now, i find that i hate myself less (lol) and i kinda dont wanna destroy myself anymore, so even if my brain tells me to starve I can never carry through. Which is a good thing. So i guess the point of all this waffling is to share my story and also to point out the importance of the mental aspect of recovery. Because i find that when the mind recovers, the body also follows. I've been able to eat somewhat normally without overthinking too much, follow EH cues etc. since my brain doesnt panic too much anymore and have sort of just given up on the idea of self-destruction if that makes any sense. 

Anyway im still eating my peanut butter and toast, and this week has been the first time ive gained a substantial amount of weight in a year. Good luck to me hop i can keep it up"
Recovery,"Sudden body change causing distress  (For context, I have been in AN recovery for a little over a year and have been weight restored for most of that time.)

On the night of August 12, I got home very late after getting in a very stressful and emotional conversation that lasted about an hour. As I hadn’t eaten in a very long time and was probably mentally fatigued, I helped myself to a LOT of leftover pasta from my family’s dinner, two pieces of garlic bread, and some peanut butter. I then went straight to bed whereas I normally would have done my workout routine because I was so tired.

Since then, my body has felt so different that I am really struggling to feel comfortable in my own skin. >!The scale has been fluctuating wildly: the day after this incident, my weight went up two and a half pounds. It has since bounced around erratically between that higher number and what I usually weigh.!< I will admit that in these past four days I have eaten a lot more than I normally would (mostly in the form of peanut butter, as I seem to be craving it a lot), but those initial emotions of distress aren’t there anymore. In fact, when I’ve eaten these past few days, I genuinely feel fine and never eat to the point of sickness or anything. I’m not bored, either - I just seem to keep feeling hungry no matter what (and for mostly higher calorie foods, too).

More distressing, however, has been how my body actually physically FEELS. My entire abdomen feels not only much bigger than it was, but much squishier. It genuinely feels like I have just a thick pad of water covering my entire stomach that I can’t take off. I have continued to work out but this is not changing anything about how my body feels. I know that I haven’t atrophied because I am still able to exercise without difficulty, but you cannot see my muscle tone AT ALL now. >!I also noticed today with a tape measure that I have gained a full half inch around my waist, which is also visible by the increased number of fat rolls I now have when sitting or laying down.!< I genuinely do not think I have felt this way physically since I first started inpatient treatment and was gaining weight rapidly. I can only really go around in super loose clothes because anything else makes me feel too ashamed.

Is it possible for my entire physique to change THAT FAST? I have read that bloating is common in scenarios like this, and yeah, that would be expected after a high carb and sodium meal like I had on the 15th. But is it normal for those body changes to last this long? Will I ever feel like I did before this again? I am trying to hydrate a lot and am maintaining my workout routine, but the discomfort is not going away which is making it really hard for me to eat without guilt."
Recovery,"Why can’t I accept my current body?  I’ve been in recovery for about a year now, gained a lot of weight from going all-in, but am so much less food-obsessed now, and am very grateful for how far I’ve come. But, I have struggled so hard to let go of the idea that this is my “temporary” body. I just can’t let go of the feeling that I look better at a lower weight, and so the desire to be at a lower weight never goes away. This being said, I never want to be at my lowest weight again, or even close to it. But I just can’t let go of the part of me that wishes to be smaller. I’ve been especially struggling with this lately, as I’ve just ended a relationship, and am more conscious about how my body might be perceived. Accepting my current body feels like lowering my own standards for myself, which I just can’t get past.  Any tips/advice on getting over this would be very much appreciated, as I’ve felt pretty stuck on it for most of recovery."
Recovery,"Eating disorders and acne (possible tw)  Have any of you guys developed acne/skin problems while dealing with an eating disorder?

I dealt with a restrictive ED from the beginning of 2021 to early 2022, and during that time, I had amenorrhea, and I also developed skin problems. I started experiencing hormonal acne for the very first time, and generally developed acne-prone, sensitive skin. Moreover, my face began to scar SO easily and it takes forever for scars to disappear. 

I’m weight restored now, and have been for about two months. I’ve had two periods. I’m still dealing with skin concerns, though. 

My question is whether or not any of you have experienced something like this. After weight restoration, did it take some time for your symptoms (specifically skin problems) to resolve? If so, how long?"
Recovery,"Day 9 of going all in... Struggling  Today hasn't been great. Maybe don't read this if hearing about restrictive thoughts triggers you. Though I don't name any numbers or anything specific.

It started with me eating a protein pudding and cereal for breakfast, then also having the two breadrolls I packed for school. I felt so uncomfortable in my body that I struggled with picking out my outfit. I almost missed my bus because of this. At the bus stop, I accidentally turned of my phone. It's a new one and I hadn't memorized the code, so I wasn't able to use my phone all day.

At school, the hot weather really got to me. I had no energy. I only felt better after drinking coffee. Our school sells baked goods as well, but I bought an apple with my coffee instead. I'm such a coward. My teacher gave out chocolate to us in class and it took me a while to muster up the courage to eat it. But I did it. She looked at me while I was eating it. She knows about my ED, because I broke into tears once when she asked me if I had lost weight a few months ago. She's been very supportive and let me know that she's always there for me when I need help.

After school, I had to wait almost an hour for my bus. I killed some time by visiting the grocery store. I got a salmon wrap to eat while waiting for the bus and some snacks for home, since my snack stash is almost empty. I ate the wrap and was full. But mental hunger was still present. I was craving something sweet. I had packed a protein bar for school. And even though I felt like restricting, I still ate it.

I missed my second bus and ended up having to walk home. In the scorching sun. I have some blisters on my feet now.

I feel like I ate too much already and the will to restrict is so so strong. Today's dinner will be burgers. I usually have two. But I'm so scared. Even just eating one will be a struggle for me.

I hate being like this. My ED is so loud today. And it's impacting evrything else as well. I hate everything today. I just want this day to end already.

I know that I need all the calories I can get. I have to eat more. I need to increase to finally start gaining some more weight. I've been stuck at the same weight for a while now. That's the reason I went all in to begin with. But can I really call this all in? When I'm thinking of restricting? When I still get scared of the calories? Fuck.

Maybe I can't do this on my own. I was doing so well these past few days. Today feels like a huge setback. The thought of fasting even crossed my mind. I know I wouldn't be able to do it. But man, I really scared myself there.

I'll have dinner in maybe an hour from now. I'm so scared. I want to cry. But Ill try to push through.

I might give an update afterwards.

I'm sorry for spreading so much negativity.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

I ended up having one burger for dinner. It was yummy. I don't know how to feel about it. I'm a bit diappointed in myself. I usually would have had two, but I couldn't bring myself to eat another one. I did get an ice cream bar for dessert though! My thoughts are all over the place. Did I restrict? Did I eat too much? Did I eat enough? Why did I almost have a breakdown over a protein bar today, but still eat ice cream after dinner? 

For now, I should distract myself and stop thinking about it. Though I think there's still something holding me back and I can't just ignore it. Obviously, the restrictive thoughts are all too present. And the more I give into small restrictions, the louder the ED voice gets. It starts with the first food decisions I make in a day, like pouring myself a smaller portion of cereal on purpose. Even if I eat more afterwards, I still restricted. This has to stop."
Disordered,"TW: why am I losing weight in ED recovery?  So I've been in recovery for a while now, and initially gained a lot of weight until I was a long long way above my already plus size pre ED body. Took a long time to accept myself but I finally did, stopped gaining weight and maintained for long enough for me to replace my entire wardrobe with clothes for my new body. I accepted I'd never be smaller again without damaging my health. 

For a few months I've stopped eating recovery minimums (a next step my nutritionist helped me take since I'd been in recovery for 2 years by then) and began the process of learning how to eat intuitively.  Nowadays I honour my hunger and don't really think about food much apart from when im hungry which is amazing and so freeing. However recently I had to get weighed at the doctors for some new meds, i asked for it to be blind but it was on the documents so I ended up seeing it after inadvertently, and I've lost significant weight since they last weighed me. 

However my main feeling is disappointment. I feel like a failure for losing weight even though it wasn't intentional. And idk why I feel this way? I keep obsessing over some way I was inadvertently restricting myself and how on earth I managed to rack up a caloric deficit and now every time I want to eat a fruit or something I'm worrying I somehow subconsciously craved a grapefruit because I'm relapsing when I'm not, I just wanted a grapefruit. Idk. Does anyone have any advice? I'm so anti diet culture and the other day my coworker said I look thinner and to keep up the good work (doesn't know about my ed and I pass as fat so... society smh) and it feels like I'm failing."
Disordered,"How do you deal with comments about body  I felt like I wanted to restrict after someone said, ""I look healthier and meatier than before."" I wanted to get better because of my ""near-death experience,"" which made me scared. I almost passed out from headache and palpitations! However, I'm also afraid since I've experienced bullying because of my weight, and others around me frequently make comments about it. I worry about becoming normal weight again because I'm currently in the ""underweight"" zone. How do you handle criticisms about your body? I believe ignoring it won't help. I'm beginning to lose hope."
Disordered,"I think I‘ve had artificial periods for two years and now finally get proper, biological periods again  Warning: very much tmi.

Basically the title. My eating disorder started when I was an early teen and I lost my period for two years, which was the major reason why I eventually recovered.

After I recovered I started taking the pill at age 17. I then relapsed at the beginning of the pandemic, but caught myself quickly after a few months. I thought I was in recovery, retrospectively it was quasi recovery though. I was still at a weight that was unnatural for my body. However, I thought I was in the clear, since I still got my period every month.

I suspect that those were actually artificial periods, created by the pill. I changed the pill I was on when I was at my lowest weight and my periods got increasingly lighter. Not even periods really, more like bloody discharge (I have always been a heavy bleeder naturally). I attributed this to the change of the pill, but now I‘m sure it was because of my low weight.

Well, I started proper recovery three months ago. The best decision I’ve made this year. I just walked to the bus stop and I felt something (of course I was wearing white pants). Well, I ran home and went home, and there it was: proper blood. And lots of it. Even though I‘m in the middle of the sachet and should actually start my period in two weeks time. I haven‘t been this happy about a period in years. This is proof that I am doing what‘s right for my body, and I couldn‘t be more happy and proud of myself. Just wanted to share my small little victory."
Disordered,Is there a difference between intuitive eating and listening to your extreme hunger?  
Disordered,"Does eating mostly sweets cause anyone cold symptoms?  Since I’m really trying to be honest about my hunger, I’m allowing much more sweets every day. But even before I went all in, sweets were biggest calories of my day, for two reasons. One because I really like them, but two because Covid messed with my senses to the point where most savory food either tastes bad, or doesn’t taste like anything. So, I do crave savory foods that I have restricted, but it’s honestly hard for me to eat then because they don’t taste good. I have always loved onions, but now they taste like armpits to me, and onions are in soooo much shit it’s ridiculous. Same with peppers, and even as I try to incorporate more savory foods, I can’t help but notice they all have this similar off taste. So, I don’t want to restrict myself with the sweets, but I am starting to feel like I have a cold all the time, and more headaches, and I don’t know what to do"
Disordered,"Eating in front of otherd  How do you cope with this? I experience so much anxiety surrounding it, that I often feel physically sick and dizzy and then unable to eat. I want to avoid eating in front of others all together but experience a lot of anxiety around that too, because I worry then people are judging me for NOT eating (especially when they know/suspect I have an eating disorder). I have social anxiety disorder, contamination ocd, as well as food allergies which make it even more difficult as I can’t always eat what someone has cooked or eat with others at a restaurant if the place isn’t allergy friendly (and then I don’t want to seem high maintenance for needing to request “special” food or preparation). 

Ughhh, please tell me I’m not the only one who experiences inordinate amounts of anxiety about eating around others? I have avoided so many events and gatherings over the years that I rarely even get invited to eat with others anymore, but sometimes I need to. And sometimes the situation comes up and I get invited to something and I don’t want to miss out anymore"
Disordered,"That weird in between of extreme hunger and going back to your normal eating habits..  Hi everyone!! So I have been in recovery for around 3 full months and had around 2-3 months of extreme hunger! 

However the last couple of weeks my appetite has been very weird and some days I’m starving and others I’m eating a little less. I feel like it’s hard to tell what to do. Part of me is eating whenever hungry but I find I’m eating half of my portions and coming back for more in an hour or two. It’s really uneven and I’m kinda getting scared… I don’t think I’m restricting! But it is confusing when my appetite wants to go down and I eat half my meals and snacks and I’m full.

Disordered,"Suspected food intolerances. Any suggestions to not let this ruin all my progress?  TW for unintentional weight loss
I’ve been in recovery for over a year now and I’m doing great. On my way to getting regular periods (have a bit of problems with it on campus but it’s consistent when I am home on breaks :/ )
For over a year now I’ve had lots of digestive problems. (TMI..) Alternating constipation and loose stools with undigested food occasionally, but everyone always says that’s a part of recovery so I figured it would pass. But I’m still dealing with it now.. and things went even more downhill for me in June. Unrelenting fatigue and constant diarrhea/loose stools for the past 6 weeks. Lost a very very slight amount of weight in these past six weeks too (and I’ve eating more than usual) 
Soo my doctor is suspecting celiac.. and if it’s not that a different food intolerance. I don’t really like the idea of having to cut out any foods in my diet as I’ve worked so hard to get where I am. Has anyone gone through something similar and how did you keep it from putting a damper on recovery?"
Disordered,"Because there just aren’t enough EH posts on here haha  TW: calories and weight mentioned 

Okay. So, now that it’s been explained to me that EH can be triggered by eating, I definitely have it. When I don’t eat, I’m not consumed or preoccupied by food at this point, but as soon as I start, it’s as if I can’t stop and it’s pretty out of control, especially at night.

At this point I’m hovering around 110-112 pounds at 5’6, up from about 102 or so (I’ve never been that caught up in numbers, but that range). I would say I’m eating about 6k calories a day and have been for the past 6 weeks. After two weeks my weight hit where it is now and it’s not budging. I am aware this is still underweight, but not sure how to gain without literally making myself sick eating so much. 

The EH comes in because it’s super sporadic. Some days I have it and some I don’t, I’d say it’s about 50/50, so some days I hit recovery minimums and others Im going nuts with like 10k calories a day. I feel like I should hit about 125 pounds to truly be healthy. Not sure how to do this without counting and feeling like crap stuffing myself…..anyone else been through this? Have you struggled to gain at fort and then suddenly you do? I’m stunned I actually WANT to gain, but I truly do. I feel SO much better at 112 I can only imagine how much better I’d feel fully in the healthy BMI range"
Disordered,"tips for going off to college while recovering?  I'm going to be going off to college soon (hopefully) and living in the dorms. I know because of this, and the ""freshman 15"" things are going to be a lot different. Especially because theres more people, more relationships, more judgement. Does anyone have any tips on how to keep the disorder voice away and to keep up progress? 

I guess I'm just worried im going to relapse because of the stress and the fear of the scenario of my family seeing me after gaining a bunch of weight. I wish I could tell my therapist this but Im afraid of coming off as attention seeking, or like i dont have an ED because im not actively participating in it anymore. anything would help!"
Disordered,"Shopping with my mother is a new level of torture  I love my mother, and probably always will. But like a lot of those in the ED community, my disorder was partly started and promoted by her. She pushes and pushes and pushes until you snap, and once you do she acts like you're the one who started the whole mess. I know I'm certainly flawed, but It pains me to see myself acting like my mother at times. The short temper, the yelling and fighting, the victimizing. 

Last week I went shopping for new clothes with my mom for school. I think she still thinks im as small as I was during the height of my ED. I told her my fears about growing out of the clothes she picked out for me, saying the possibility that I might gain more weight within a few months or something like that. (I've returned to a pretty healthy weight and am eating regularly, pretty much physically recovered but that doesn't mean its not a possibility.) I just really didn't want any clothes that were tight or left marks on my stomach because of their indents. But my mother just said that ""its fine"" and just to ""not gain anymore weight."" For some reason that really ticked me off. 

She's the one who assumed I had an eating disorder, but ever since then shes never talked about it. Shes never said anything about it with me, and has continued to talk about her dieting and her workouts and how ""fat"" she is. Its like my eating disorder and depression dont exist to her, like im just having a phase. 

 It pains me to watch my sister growing into my mother. I hope if she learns anything from me, she learns to not take everything my mother does at face value. Over the years I've seen my mothers flaws and realized why she is the way she is, but it doesnt make it any easier. I just wish I new how to articulate my words, I wish I could figure out how to tell her, ASK HER to stop. To just stop talking about it with me? 

Everyone in my family thinks im too ""sensitive"" because of the things I believe, but its so frustrating to hear them appeal to diet culture and their racism, Im just so sick of being unable to voice my opinions without being twisted out to be the bad guy. Maybe I'm developing a victim complex though now, too."

Disordered,"What to do when you're still living with a family that perpetuates ED triggering ideals?  With ED triggering ideals I mean stuff like commenting on your eating habits, being worried about your ""unhealthy"" nutrition, praising working out or making comments about other people's bodies (or just mentioning their own sports activities and body ideals). A comment from my mum on my eating habits actually triggered my relapse a few weeks ago and she doesn't know yet. I feel very distant from her now and I don't really think about the severity of it all, but sometimes it just hits me and I don't see a way out.

Disordered,"all-in & ""overshoot""/ weight redistribution  hi all!

i just need to put my thoughts out there right now because it's doing me no good holding them in lol.

first of all, i've been all-in since the beginning of june, and i am just starting to feel a bit better! i began nutritional rehabilitation/weight restoration in the beginning of april, and i was ""weight-restored"" when i began all-in (for context, i was never clinically ""underweight"" to begin with), so i guess i've been actively recovering for a little over 4 months now! it feels strange, and a large part of me is questioning the decision to recover... i don't really feel like i want to. this life that i have now is more miserable than the one i had when i was actively restricting. i know semi-starvation affects how we remember things & what we remember, and that i could be blocking out the miserable aspects of life during high restriction, but i just don't know how much longer i can continue on living the life that i am right now. just to clarify, i am not suicidal-- i do not want to end my life, and i am hopeful that it will get better, but i am just feeling so impatient. 

i have relapsed 3 times in the past 8 years, and i am currently in recovery from my third and most painful relapse. i have very, very strong urges to restrict in an effort to lose the ""overshoot"" weight i have put on. i feel very, very uncomfortable in this body. i don't feel strong, healthy, or energized, like some people claim they do with weight gain. i feel lethargic, weighed-down, and constricted. to console myself, i binge. i no longer restrict after binging, as i am all too familiar with that harmful cycle, but the binging has not gone away. instead of being triggered by restriction, my binges are triggered by feelings of shame and helplessness about myself. i am trying to ride the wave of this ""overshoot,"" but i can't help myself from hoping this weight will melt off. i have heard so many mixed stories, where some people lose their ""overshoot"" weight and some don't, and where some people experience weight redistribution and some don't. i understand that we all have different bodies and different recoveries, and that my desire to lose the ""overshoot"" and have my weight redistribute is inherently disordered, but i just can't imagine living like this forever. i don't feel free. i'm tired of seeing influencers claim that they gained weight, but also gained ""happiness, freedom, and their lives back."" i'm happy for them, but this is not realistic. my weight gain has been accompanied by misery and preoccupation with my body. 

i guess this post is just my way of seeking reassurance-- that recovery WILL work out and things will get better. that weight gain ceases to feel like an obstacle. that the desire to lose weight/control my body will subside. i need convincing that losing weight is not the answer."

My boss brought plum cake to work again and I had a slice at lunch break. Then, a few hours later, her mom visited and she brought a freshly baked plum cake. It was still warm, straight out of the oven. I think their family has a thing for plum cake lmao
Everyone gathered to get a slice. And I had one too.
I broke a major ED rule right there. Having two slices of cake, even though I wasn't hungry. And two slices of the same type of cake at that.
But honestly, how can anyone refuse fresh cake out of the oven? It tastes so much better when it's warm. And it was a lot better than the cake my boss brought (which was from a bakery in the city she lives in)

Though, when I cut myself a slice of the mom's cake, she told me to get a bigger slice. I felt a bit weird eating in front of everyone. I usually don't struggle with eating in public, but since all my coworkers know about my ED (my mom told them behind my back... But they don't know that I know) I feel like I'm being watched whenever I'm eating around them or even when food is around. They offer me food all the time. And I used to refuse every time, but I'm getting more comfortable with accepting it. But only if I feel like eating. If I genuinely don't want anything, I won't force myself to eat. It's just hard to differentiate between my ED not wanting me to eat and the real me not wanting to eat/not being hungry.

Tomorrow will be our one year anniversary in our new building and also the last day of work for one of our dentists (I work at a dentist's and ironically, we only ever have sugary food around haha). I've got school tomorrow and usually wouldn't be at work, but I'm thinking about paying them a visit after school. I know there'll be cake etc. And it does make me a bit anxious. Part of me wants to join them. The other part wants to stay at home. I'll decide spontaneously.

If I do decide to go, I'd like to bring something as well. I absolutely love baking and I'd like to bake some cake or cupcakes, but I don't know if I'll even have enough time after school. Hmmm.."

The thing is I promised I was not going to the gym anymore to prove I'm really trying to recover. I was going 4 to 5 days a week, then 3 when startes recovery and now 0 since if I keep loosing weight I will get impatient and I just can't. I'm making short of 3 small meals and snack a day since I almost don't have hunger cues (just safe foods tho) but I still count calories. I try to hit no less than 8000 steps a day and at least do some yoga and pilates in my free time so I don't feel so guilty but it's not enough! I feel the need to go to the gym or skip some meal all the time but like I said I don't wanna get impatient and even less fail all the ppl that love me and trust in my recovery but I feel like my stomach is growing minute by minute and that I'm not that sick anyways and just greedy and lazy and making excuses to not work out, or that I don't need to eat that much since I don't work out, it's really frustrating!"
Recovery,"weird sleeping patterns in recovery  okay, i’m on day 8 of “all in” and you can probably wage from my post history that i’m more doing like “50-75% in” because i’m still probably not eating nearly enough or truly listening to my hunger (don’t have a meal plan am mostly mechanically eating three meals a day and having a snack a couple of times a day if i feel like it) but i notice that ever since i stopped counting calories and started eating a bit less restrictively (not without restrictions, mind you, and most definitely not enough either calorically or in general) my sleep patterns have been getting weirder. i notice that almost every night i wake up at least twice from about 2 to 5 am (i usually get up somewhere in between 7 to 9) and last night i literally woke up like once every hour or so between 2 and 6. 

my first time restricting was when i was a teenager, and weirdly enough i remember a similar thing happening for a couple of months after i stopped, but it was never this extreme (for reference both my first period restricting and my current relapse have both lasted about four months) i’m just wondering if this is a normal recovery experience or if it’s a sign that i’m not eating enough and should try to get more food in."

Recovery,"Menstrual cycle & extreme hunger  After ovulation, before my period, I seriously eat everything. It’s really good at challenging my ED thoughts and restrictions, although I generally eat foods that aren’t as nutrient dense, but that’s ok.

Recovery,"Eating induced (mental) hunger?  Hi everyone! Long time lurker here😊🫶🏻
I have been actively in recovery since the beginning of May after restricting for almost a year and loosing almost half my bodyweight (started out pretty obese). While I am trying to honor all hunger and cravings, I noticed something the last weeks that I don’t quite understand and wanted go get some feedback / insight from this awesome community.

I noticed that I am not really hungry or am experiencing “normal” hunger (so no EH, no bad cravings, “just” hunger) UNTIL I start eating. After I start eating (usually what should be a well balanced and satisfying meal) it seems like there is just a ton of food needed to fulfill this (mostly mental) hunger and it seems like it switches from physical to mental hunger and craving start to kick in.

Recovery,"Back again…  I’m noticing I’m starting to have some warning signs happening that could lead to a relapse. 
I’ve been doing so well for months I wasn’t having any disordered thoughts at all. 
Now I’ve been thinking about planning food, planning weigh ins and comparing my body to how it’s looked in the past. 
I semi know why, I’ve been stressed the last few weeks at work and the workload has been crazy. It started as I thought I might be losing weight accidentally as I thought I was noticing changes in my face and so I starting trying to make sure I’m definitely eating enough during the week while I’m working. Now I’m thinking that I’ve gained weight and have been having thoughts of cutting back on what I eat. 
I feel extremely disappointed that this is happening. I thought I’d finally gotten past eating issues, that I’d recovered. 
Now I feel like I’m back in the cycle. 
Obviously I still don’t want to relapse and I know I don’t actually want to lose weight.
I don’t know what to do, I feel like because it’s been so long since I’ve had these thoughts I don’t know how to control them anymore. 
I know i just have to keep eating and try and get back to how I was and what I was doing before the work stress happened but I don’t know how to get rid of the thoughts. 
My hopeful theory is that if I keep eating and stop planning food that the thoughts will go away again after a few weeks. 

Support and any ideas would be greatly appreciated. 
Ps I’m like 99.95% sure my weight hasn’t changed at all and that everything I’m noticing are just fluctuations from stress and having been sick on and off with colds etc constantly from my job."
Recovery,"Did anyone experience extreme hunger after recovering from anemia?  Two years ago I was diagnosed with severe anemia.

I was confused at first, but I figure this is just how my body wants to be now.
I also am completly unable to skip meals or restricting. I get unwell and angry. 

It was a painfull at first to buy new clothes and getting comments from my parents who are active practioners of diet culture.
But the maintenance phase podcast helped a lot.

 
Did anyone experience something similiar?

By doctor just told me to ""cut some capuccinos from my diet because of full-fad milk"" and go for a run.

Recovery,"recovery comments  I hate seeing people that I last saw while deep in my ED (or anyone who knew me before now that I am in overshoot tbh) because the comments about me 'looking so much better' are so.... hard and awkward to navigate? 

last summer I was horrifically underweight and I saw family friends I haven't seen in a year since before I recovered and was so.. uncomfortable by their comments. One said they hardly recognized me because of 'how much I have changed since last year' and another said 'it is truly amazing how different you look, keep it up' 

I know they mean it in a positive way, but how do I.... respond to this? obviously I can tell I sm bigger now I don't need people to tell me & the weight gain doesn't bother me I just get so uncomfortable with the comments .. how do others deal?"
Recovery,"Fear of food???  Recently I have been honoring my cravings for cookies. However, Even though I honor it. I find that I go to sleep with this extreme fear that I will eat cookies the next day. It makes no sense at all but the cookie gives me fear and I know I’ll still eat it anyways. Recently I have just been eating cookies for breakfast but I find that the fear continues. Is this a part of recovery? I am so confused on this whole fear thing"
Recovery,"Will I recover...?  So recently I have ditched the scale and all rules about food. However, I find myself eating around 1800 calories but that’s on completely just listening to my body. I’m underweight and I’m not sure if I’m doing the right thing. I am eating all meals and honoring my cravings but i am not sure if this is enough. Do people need to eat even when they’re not hungry in recovery?"
Recovery,"When to let go of a meal plan TW numbers  I have been trying to recover from my ed and i have gained weight to a bmi of >!17.5!< and i am still gaining on this meal plan. I want to let go of meal plans and just eat what i want and maintains at my set point but i’m not sure when or how to do that. Should i start now? I am sure i would still gain weight as i am hungry for everything on my meal plan. or should i keep following it till i am a healthy bmi. 
I also feel like it will be very hard to let go of and I will constantly be comparing what i am eating to the meal plan and if it is enough or too little."
Recovery,"hunger question  hello everyone, a little question fo y'all

I've been through anorexia nervosa this year and I'm recovering. I've been through a period of extreme hunger (still here) but I feel it's going a bit down.
My sister (my age) has always been very supportive and a very good example of intuituve eater.


Yesterday, she asked me how did I feel right now and how my relationship with food was going. I told her that I was better but that i still have this impression of being constantly hungry. And she told me ""oh don't worry, same""

I wonder if she said that as a joke/ to comfort me, or if she really meant it.
My question is : is that normal ? Do normal people are hungry all the time ? Do I have to live with hunger ??"
Recovery,"late night hunger  obviously, i get hungry late at night because i don’t eat enough during the day. but the problem is, i just don’t get hungry during the day. basically every meal until dinner i feel like i have to force myself to eat by adding some sort of a sweet as a side. but if i eat too late at night i get even less hungry during the next day and the cycle repeats. also i hate eating late at night because 1. dumb ed rule which i’m inconsistent about breaking 2. i am tired and don’t want to clean up after myself lmfao. hopefully tomorrow i can bring myself to get enough food in during the day so this doesn’t keep happening."
Recovery,"fuck the little voice that guilt trips me  i’ve been eating more lately because i went off my meds for a bit and my appetite came back. been eating and craving like crazy. at least crazy to me.i shouldn’t be feeling bad about it because it’s healthy. it’s what my body needs. it’s what i’ve been wanting, to eat more again. but i feel like fuckin shit because that voice in my head is tellin me im gaining weight. it’s tellin me i look different. i look in the mirror and i feel and look physically bigger. i want to starve again but my hair falls out when i lose weight fast. but i cant continue to eat like this because it’s mentally torturous. it’s like 
if i succumbed to my ed, i’m in physical “pain”
but if i fight my ed i’m in mental pain
id rather have the physical pain tbh"
Disordered,"Why does it make more sense to eat a loaf of bread in one day so “it’s not in the house anymore” instead of just enjoying it over a few days?  I don’t really understand why I do these things? I don’t want to binge, it’s not enjoyable. I’d rather be able to eat a sandwich every day than eat the entire loaf of bread in a few hours.

Recovery,"(TW!) Relapsed momentarily into purging, how do I stop from a full relapse?  Title says it basically. I'm on a cruise and my usual 4 drink limit seems to not apply because of the movement of the ship. I was really nauseous, already *severely* struggling with body image, and trying really hard to not start restricting again and I decided ""oh it's not so bad if it's just once,"" and I purged to ""stop feeling nauseous."" I would be lying if I said I didn't feel a bit happy, albeit guilty. 

Today I found myself choosing the lowest calorie items on the menu, reverting to old habits. 

Has anyone else here relapsed but cut off a full relapse and successfully made it *really* just a one time thing? What did you do that helped you be successful?

Recovery,"I have to host Thanksgiving this year and I’m panicked  My family has a habit of ignoring boundaries, and they’ve pushed me to host Thanksgiving. I tried to protest, but they’ve all already bought plane tickets so it’s happening. 

Thanksgiving is triggering as fuck for me, and I try to avoid *attending* Thanksgiving events, let alone hosting. I’m nowhere NEAR the “home cooked meal” tier of recovery. I’m a vegetarian in a family of meat eaters, and the thought of having to help cook a turkey makes me want to barf. 

I’ve had this ED my whole life, and they’ve known about it for years. I feel like there’s no way to tackle this problem that doesn’t draw attention to the fact that I’m not as recovered as they want me to be. Can I order a Thanksgiving meal from a place?

Disordered,"worried that I might have an eating disorder  Sorry because I kind of wrote a longer post than I intended, but I needed to get some things out..

I've been struggling with being overweight for as long as I can remember (28 now). I've tried some healthy ways to get myself to a healthy spot, but I just lost the weight, gained it back, lost a bit, and gained back more...  Now after the pandemic I'm at my heaviest I've ever been and it really does make me sad. I know that it's unhealthy and I want to get to a good spot again, but it's like I'm unable to.

I don't know if it's a food addiction or some form of BED or what. I often find myself eating more than what is normal (usually not healthy food), even though I have healthy options at home (since my intention was to eat healthy when I was in the supermarket). Or I get these cravings for certain foods and while I'm buying it I'm literally thinking don't do it: it's unhealthy, you'll gain more weight,... And STILL I do it WHILE I'm thinking it :(

It's not like I have these random moments where I suddenly would eat anything within reach, regardless of what it is. It's really craving and ""bingeing"" if you will on the unhealthy foods (either for dinner and/or something like chips or other snacks late at night). Then I get these periods where I try to be more strict because obviously just trying to buy and cook the healthy food isn't working since it's already at home. Then I start to register literally everything and all the calories that I eat and start restricting, which just feels unhealthy and obsessive too... Then after a few days or weeks of being strict with what I eat, I fall right back into the bad eating habits of eating too much and unhealthy... Like there's no in-between.

I've made an appointment with a therapist that I can see later this year because I feel like there is something wrong with me that I can't just eat healthily and normally, even though I know the risks of being overweight and I hate looking like I do as well... At the same time I sometimes think it's just me being lazy with no self-control and discipline and that there is nothing wrong with me except being addicted to junk food or something.  I worry that they won't be able to help me since it's me who needs to be strong enough to say no to myself and the urges....

I constantly get comments from my family as well saying that I need to do something, that it's not healthy,... as if I don't know that already. My grandma even goes as far as comparing me to other overweight people and making comments. It honestly makes me feel more ashamed of myself and my body than I already am and I just want to tell them to mind their own freaking business (as a side note, I have hirsutism which already destroyed my self-esteem).

I don't know, I just feel crappy about my eating behaviors and I don't know why I do it, how to be normal or to get myself healthy again and keep it that way. I'm worried that it's a life-long battle that I'm just gonna give up at some point because I don't want to constantly think about calories and weight day in-day out..."
Disordered,"Just a slight rant  i first discovered this group in height of my ed, went through multiple small relapses, ive never been that serious but i still have to now accept the damage ive down to myself mentally, the crying over cream in a restaurant full of people, the attempted purges, the weighing strawberries, the nights where i spent an hour on thinspo threads then forced myself to sit in a mirror and cry, all the compliments, the looking up calories in menus before going. Its left such a huge.. hole?? I cant forget about what happened i cant pretend it never happened, its just so painful and so,, here?? idk but this is going to have an impact on the rest of my life, and ive never talked to anyone about it exept online, and my mom keeps telling me to not ""slip up"" and how i was ""doing so well"" and how she finds im eating to much now, mostly because she has no clue. And everytime theese emotions just feel so raw so present, it feels even worse than it did when i was going through it. And yet im still grateful i lost weight ? But at the same time i just wish i could go back to before. Anyways i just wish ppl noticed or cared a bit while i was going through it, but it was never serious enough, and now im dealing with it alone, at 14 with no emotional support."
Recovery,"Eating proper meals.  During my eating disorder recovery, or my attempt anyways - I noticed that I was never truly full no matter how much I ate. 

I always had the fear of eating proper meals. I knew I’d give in to extreme hunger so in a sort of desperate attempt to slow down ‘bingeing’ and weight gain I’d only eat snacky foods. For example, I’d eat a sausage roll but wouldn’t have anything with it that would actually fill me up. Id call the sausage roll a meal even though I wasn’t full; which led to me eating so much more because I wasn’f satisfied.

Anyhow, I’m on holiday at the moment. I vowed that I wouldn’t let it be like my last one where I was constantly restricting and missed out on so many good foods - I’ve just been going for it.

For the first time in so long I feel satisfied? I’ve been eating proper meals that fill me up and it’s so freeing. I haven’t eaten in hours but because I’ve properly fed myself I haven’t spent it constantly fixating on food and what my next meal is going to be. 

I still think about it in some regard but I’m actually EXCITED to try all the good foods here. I know when I eventually get to them the fried donuts will be banging. 

It almost makes me sad that when last time I was on holiday I was still restricting heavily. There was so many good foods I wanted to try but didn’t. Here the foods aren’t as good and its such a shame.
 
It doesn’t mean I don’t feel bad about the food I put in my body and it doesn’t mean I don’t have the feeling that I’m going to gain and feel horrible. It doesn’t mean that I don’t try to restrict by feeling like I can’t have two burgers since they’re ‘proper meals’ in a day. I accept those thoughts and eat anyways because that fucking chicken burger was so good. 

I feel okay for now and that’s so much better than how it was before!!"
Disordered,"dreams  tw for exercise i guess?

okay we all know the classic food dreams where you wake up in an absolute state- completely convinced you are a massive chocolate cake.

well 

my dreams recently have been along those lines in a way?? i keep dreaming that i’m running through my town a whole bunch, in a secretive way too so i know it’s in a way that’s driven by my eating disorder. i wake up and i honestly don’t know how i feel- it scares me a lot but also i feel weirdly accomplished? 

i’m not expecting any dream interpreters but was wondering if anyone else had experienced this or even had any words of wisdom"
Recovery,"Day 7 of going all in  It's been a full week of all in recovery for me. And I already feel like I've made lots of progress mentally! I want to keep my journal updated as well, but I haven't found the time or motivation to. So these posts serve as a stand in for my journal in a sense.

Today my family and I went swimming. I had a protein pudding, an apple, a protein bar and a sandwich for breakfast. My family, except for my brother who had a bowl of cereal, didn't eat breakfast. This would have triggered me a few days ago, but now I try to ignore it. It's their choice, their loss. 

I expected us to get something at the pool, but we didn't. We ended up not having lunch and ordered pizza for dinner. It was my suggestion. I was craving pizza so much. And I was so hungry, since I hadn't eaten in for like 10 hours. So I enjoyed my goddamn pizza. My biggest fear food is slowly turning into something I can enjoy again :) I also snacked on some pizza bread afterwards. I am full and satisfied now. Pizza used to give me panic attacks. I felt horrible the first few times I had it in recovery. But now I can recognize that the fullness I get from a pizza is normal. I just wasn't used to it. And that was probably why pizza scared me so much.

And I won't let myself get triggered by my mom only eating a single slice of pizza anymore. Her small portions are very worrying. But I shouldn't let it affect me. I tried talking some sense into her, but she doesn't listen. It's not like I can force her to eat more. Just like she can't force me. 

For now I have to focus on myself. Even if it's hard to do that when you live with someone who shows signs of disordered eating."
Recovery,"Why’s my appetite gone away?  Well I’ve had 0 hunger (mental or physical) and 0 appetite the last 7 days so I made it a whole 1.5 days into “all in”which was more like 25% all in, and then just failed 
You know what I also realized is I’ve relapsed into doing more steps again. I wonder if this moving more has a correlation with why my appetite has gone away again?
I know all in is what will need to be done, as the slow approach failed for me heavily."
Recovery,"Just another EH post I suppose (TW: amounts mentioned)  I just ate a massive pancake and a piece of toast, both covered with peanut butter, a glass of milk, and a (large) cinnamon scroll. For breakfast. It's not even 6am. I'm crying and scared that I've eaten too much, and I can't focus on anything else. Convince me it's gonna be okay, please..."
Disordered,"Low natural set point? Is it a thing?  I know this is a weird question, but how can I ""justify"" that I am underweight and that I need to gain? Today I weighed >!51,5kg!< at a height of >!170cm!<, as a 22 year old man. I have maintained a bit of a lower weight than that for 1+ year that I know of, only recently (past few weeks, month or two) have I gained weight and can actually ""feel"" different (my stomach flaps are objectively thicker than before, and my ribcage is less visible).

My question again is how can I tell myself I actually need to gain weight? In my head, or at least in my ED head, I tell myself that maybe that low weight is my natural set point, since I've maintained said weight for such a long time. I think a lot about food and calories and exercise etc., always planning meals and ""planning"" binges (e.g. I always eat X amounts of candy on Saturday evening), so I obviously have ED behaviors, but can I still be at my ""natural"" weight regardless? I know very few people naturally have a low BMI, so what if I'm one of the few who is supposed to be at >!a BMI of 18!<? I just want to hear your thoughts on this matter; because I feel ""wrong"" in gaining weight in case I'm already at my set point, which is admittedly low."
Disordered,baking  i know this is such a recovery stereotype but i fucking love baking. right before my relapse hit i started to get into baking and now i’ve gotten back into it :) i have a batch of chocolate chip cookies in the oven right now (weirdly enough i wasn’t huge on them pre-relapse but now they’re like one of my favourite cookie types?) that i made with peanut butter (i was following a specific recipe because i’m still trying to get rid of expired ground almond and not have that shit go to waste) and i might make another batch or try another recipe depending on if i have time to. maybe shortbread with sprinkles. or peppermint with chocolate chips. or maybe i’ll wait until we go to the store and get white chocolate chips to give red velvet a go… there are so many options and it’s so exciting!
Disordered,"my mum won't stop talking about how bad sugar is  this is kinda just me screaming into the void. I'm on day 4 or 5 of all-in, and I think I'm doing insanely well and I'm really proud, especially because I'm more-or-less doing it alone.

Anyway, for quick backstory, summer is my biggest trigger and my initial development of Ana (and both subsequent relapses) were all caused by the need of a 'bikini body'. I went through my most severe restriction in may-july recently, but a week-ish ago I decided to recover for real. My mom has been weighing me weekly since late May and constantly telling me i need to gain XYZkg, and controlling my food (just dinner) to make me eat a lot more (spoiler alert she was quite bad at it, obviously.)

I think on the second day of all-in was when she first re-started talking about sugar in a 'stop eating' way. Basically, my stomach was rumbling and I felt really hungry. I knew I would have an ice cream as soon as it stopped raining, and I'd had a big lunch, but I still honoured my hunger (I was so proud, it was my first time in months I'd listened to hunger.) I had a small muffin, but after about 10 minutes I was obviously really hungry again. I had two Oreo's and my mum told me I 'm eating too much sugar and should have fruit. When she turned around, I had a third because I was still hungry.

The next day, we were going to get an ice-cream and I mentioned I wanted two scoops. She proceeded to tell me I'd been eating too much sugar the past few days and I was ' going too far in the other direction.' I asked her WTF that means, and she said that I was just being a different type of unhealthy. i told her thats not a worry, and she said she decideds whags healthy or not.


Yesterday with my lunch I wanted a Nutella muffin, because that's a food I liked pre-ed. She didnt want to, but she let me. her reason was that id already had one of those little chocolates they put next to her coffee earlier.

I compiled a list of articles (divided into categories of A) sugar is necessary in early recovery, b) there's no such thing as a bad food and sugar isn't evil, C) HAES and D) gentle nutrition in late recovery ) and sent them to her. She got mad and told me that she makes the nutrition rules, not me, and if I can't listen to them then she'll call my old dietician to make me a ' healthy' meal plan. To give you an idea of what she thinks of as healthy, this morning she told me I can only have two sweets a day. I don't think she'll hold me to this (I won't let her LMAO ) , but regardless who says that to someone in recovery? In less than a week we went from me being unable to eat a peach for the calories and her getting angry at me for this to me begging her to buy me a small chocolate (which I didn't have at all for those most recent relapse months) and her telling me I'm too unhealthy.


She's holding me back. I had a massive sweet tooth pre-ed, so you can imagine how many sweets I'd eat now that I'm in a recovery period famous for craving '''unhealthy'''' food. Right now a typical sweets in a day looks like:
- cereal and a pastry thing as breakfast
- some snack of my choice after lunch which is usually where i get most of my sugar fix ( usually like a choco crepe or a small/medium muffin or a slice of like, a large biscuit covered in jam that acts like a cake . Google Italian crostata)
- an ice-cream at night if I'm still feeling hungry.


I always want more tho. i think if she restricts me any more than this i'll start eating in secret, which is gonna be really hard, especially with how much work i'm putting in rn (and one of my personal ed rules being that whenever i eat it has to be in front of my parents)

worst comes to worst, when im back at home after the long holiday (bout 3 weeks left) ill have loads more freedom during the day. so i might just have to hold out till then."
Disordered,"Stuck in body avoidance  I've been in recovery for almost 4 years now, and have gotten a lot out of it-- the ability to feel joy, to think about things other than food, and honestly a lot of pride in having hauled myself out of a really deep pit. But I feel that my recovery plateaued at avoidance-- getting rid of mirrors might be a major step in early recovery, but I don't really want to live forever without being able to judge if my shirt matches my shoes. It sounds silly, but it sucks to feel like I have to avoid my recovery body in order not to get sucked into the old pit again.

I'm generally quite good about sticking to recovered behavior and my thought patterns aren't particularly plagued until I try to diverge from avoidant behaviors, and then I feel really awful until I go back to them. Generally speaking, I allow negative thoughts to exist as neutral things-- like bad neighbors, they're there, but it's my house. When I stop avoidance, they start banging on my ceiling, essentially, and it's much harder to cope with them. Avoidance and practiced neutrality has kept me healthy and was very helpful, but I can't help but want to move past it, because it doesn't feel like an end goal. I can't be playing tag with my reflection for the rest of my life!  

I suppose I'm looking for advice on becoming truly body positive, but really it's about how to outgrow survival mindset and move on to something more. Neutrality feels as much like a coping mechanism as anything else.  All the advice I see is for people in the early stages of recovery (and fair enough! That stuff is no joke!) but I'm struggling to feel truly recovered with this mindset. It's not an awful place to be, but I want to move on. Is that realistic?"
Recovery,"Day 6 of going all in  It's already the Morning of Day 7, but I realized that I haven't made a post specifically for Day 6 yet, though I did already post on here yesterday.

So. Yesterday was an amazing day. My ED, though still present, was so quiet. I mainly had healthy thoughts, I think.

I am starting to trust my body. 
I was mentally hungry after a small breakfast, so I had a second one and a morning snack after that. And after dinner, I realized I hadn't eaten a lot and that I definitely needed more if I want to gain weight. So I had more, which gave me a stomach ache. But I didn't feel bad about having a bloated stomach. I rested and let my body do its thing. It knows how to handle on its own.

And then it hit me: I am accepting weight gain.. Finally. Not only am I accepting it, I am actively working towards it. And if that means I can enjoy all the food I want, then hell yeah! Come at me, weight gain! 

I still have body dysmorphia, but it's not as strong as it used to be. I looked at my bloated stomach yesterday and I didn't see myself as huge. I was reminded that this is normal. 
Body dysmorphia is stronger when I look in the mirror. But when I see myself in pictures, I can recognize that I look sick. That must be how everyone else sees me. And no, I don't think it's pretty. It's sad. It's sad that I destroyed my body like this. 

I still have a lot of healing to do. While I am frustrated over how slowly I'm going, I've realized that it's all for a reason. 
When I first entered recovery, I only increased my intake by a bit and didn't tackle the mental side of things. It all felt so pointless. I almost wanted to give up, thinking there's no way I can recover.
I heard somewhere, that you first need to nourish yourself a bit in order to be able to make mental progress and only once you're starting to heal mentally, you can heal physically. It all goes hand in hand.

And honestly, I can see this in my progress.
I started by nourishing myself and by building new habits. Now that my brain has enough energy to function and now that I have a point of reference, I can process everything and think about what my goal is.

So I'd say my Day 6 being so good mentally was only possible because I gave my body and brain the energy to function properly. I noticed that I'm much happier on days I eat enough. ""Binges"" (though they aren't really binges) do set me back a bit, but I still keep going. When I wake up the day after having eaten a lot more than I usually would, I realize that I'm completely fine. And that's quite relieving and freeing.

Anyways, I hope today will be just as nice! My family and I will visit the indoor swimming pool we always used to visit when I was a kid. And I'm already so excited! I hope to eat some food that reminds me of the good old days, as well :)"
Recovery,"problems about recovery that i wasn’t expecting to face, would appreciate advice  so it’s been like 2 full days since i had this doctors visit that jumpstarted me into wanting to recover. i decided immediately after that visit that if i want to eat something, i am going to eat it because i can’t just keep losing weight. however this has proved to be much more difficult/complicated than i expected and i’m not quite sure what the next step should be. the problem is that i am eating more, but i can’t seem to make myself eat many calorically dense foods (i’m eating mostly vegetables, fruit, and some proteins like eggs) so i am afraid that all i am currently doing is at most stopping my weight loss. i tried using different online calculators to find my bmr but since i haven’t been counting calories i can really only guess if im hitting that or not.  also i don’t know if those calculators work for people suffering the effects of an ed. i really need to be actively gaining weight but i don’t really know how to do that in a safe way. plus, i’m a dance minor and school is about to start so as much as i need to rest in order to not raise my energy expenditure, i need to build muscle mass in order to have to the strength i need to do my work. i’ve never tried to intentionally gain weight before. i feel like maybe i would benefit from a meal plan so i have some kind of structure? should i try seeking out a dietitian? i don’t know, i just feel like im taking shots in the dark at the moment."
Recovery,honeymoon phase of recovery?  idk if this is a thing or not but if it is i think i might be entering it? day 6 of all in. evening 7. not even thinking of calories. i made cookies (more like little cookie balls because of how they ended up… i used what i thought was almond flour but is actually ground almond and the fat doesn’t mix with it the same way flour does so they ended up not really… you know that thing cookies do in the oven where they kind of expand? that didn’t happen. but they taste really good) and had a for dinner a mini pizza (they called it a “pizette”) and a cake pop (if i don’t have some sort of little sweet with every meal i will lose my mind) from an italian bakery and i’m still hungry and weirdly enough i don’t mind it? like YAY DESSERT TIME like a kid at a buffet… i did some journaling today and wrote a list of reasons to recover so idk if that’s like keeping me going or something but i feel really good and optimistic about being able to heal my body. and about being able to enjoy baking again 😭 i got really into baking right before this relapse hit and now i’m excited to get back into it.

I'm not sure if I can explain what I do exactly. 

I'm not sure if this has caused damage now or if anyone has experienced. I see my doctor on Monday. but I'm slightly freaking out"
Disordered,"How do I stop comparing myself to others and deal with feelings of not being “underweight enough” to do all in recovery?  I am so close to committing to all in. I’ve been in quasi/ high restricting with more “cheat days” the past 2ish months in an attempt to at least maintain my weight, but I have still been slowly loosing weight. Now I am >!87.3!< lbs at >!5’3!< . I know this is a dangerously low weight. People are concerned for me and I don’t even like how I look anymore. But the ED voice is still telling me that I’m not sick enough to deserve to go all in with recovery because my BMI isn’t as low as other ED sufferers and that I should wait till I loose more weight before going all in when I really don’t want to loose any more weight?? I can’t deal with the cognitive dissonance and I hate this. I really do want to recover, and all in is what makes the most sense to me logically, but my brain is telling me that I’m not thin enough to go that route"
Disordered,How can I find myself  I’m starting an outpatient hospital program after being inpatient for 2 months and each day I find myself feeling depressed. Anorexia gave me something to do and now that I’m in recovery I find myself bored and frustrated. I don’t have many friends or passions. The hobbies I used to enjoy don’t bring me any joy I always find myself sad at the end of the day. I find my mind wandering and sometimes I wish I never admitted myself even though I was close to death. I wish I could feel genuine happiness again I just feel so lonely and sad. Why does everything need to be about food? Why do I always feel fat and depressed..I don’t know how to go on recovery is so difficult and draining. Summers almost over and i just spent the whole summer in the hospital gaining weight while other people at my high school are partying and having fun. I hate my life I hate that I did this to myself I hate how weak I am.
Disordered,"Not Gaining Any Weight in Recovery?  I've been trying to recover for 6 weeks now.  Today I weighed myself for the first time since starting, and I haven't gained anything.  I thought I was doing well, so I was really disappointed, and honestly a little bit scared.

&#x200B;

I don't understand.  I haven't been restricting or exercising.  I've been feeding myself meals, I have snacks every time I get hungry, I've been trying to honour my extreme hunger to the best of my ability.  I feel like I'm eating constantly, but I haven't gained a thing.  The only reason I can think of for it, is that I buy mostly vegan/vegetarian because I have a lactose sensitivity and some meats make me sick.

&#x200B;

I buy $80 worth of groceries every 2 weeks, and I feel like that's enough for a single person.  Is my perception of how much food is normal just messed up?  Is this just normal for early recovery?  I'm really struggling, I want to get better, but this feels a little bit hopeless."

Recovery,"slowly learning to honour my hunger more  day 6 of “all-in” — i’m slowly realizing that i’m probably half assing this and am more doing “about a half of the way in” right about now because i’m still probably not eating enough, am still doing quite a bit of walking, and still consuming a lot of “safe” foods just in higher quantities. even today’s little victory, which was having a second bowl of ice cream because i was still hungry after the one i had with/for lunch (it’s really hot out today, don’t judge me for having ice cream for lunch), is only so big, because the ice cream i had was a “diet” brand with less sugar/more protein and fibre (imagine like a canadian halo top). but i wanted more, so i got it, even though it was only about an hour after lunch. i’m not counting calories - in fact i’ve been scratching out calorie counts and nutrition labels on food around the house - but if i had to ballpark estimate my intake it would probably be at about >!1500-2000!< a day, more some days and less others. my hunger signals are totally broken so it’s hard to truly honour them :( i have cravings but they’re usually not intense and sometimes come and go within seconds and when i do experience physical hunger it’s often paired with this complete mental apathy towards food so i don’t end up wanting anything.

Recovery,"being afraid of feeling full  Hi. I don't know if anyone else has this, but for some reason I'm really scared of feeling full, or eating when i don't feel really hungry. These fears started since i started eating more for recovery. Also when i eat to satisfy my hunger, my food often tends to come up my troat ( i have purged in the past, does that may come from that? ) and when that happens, i think i ate too much and feel quilty again. Also i don't really know when i should feel satisfied after eating. Did anyone else experience this, and how did you come over it?"
Recovery,"i feel like I'm recovering too fast.  Hi. I,m struggeling a bit right now. I am trying to recover from my ed and gain a bit of weight since im underweight rn.

She weight me with clothes on and just after diner, but i can't help but to feel a bit quilty. Am i gaining weight too fast? if this post is triggering to anyone, please tell me so i can delete it."
Recovery,"Ate despite not being hungry, now have a stomach ache  I weighed myself after dinner and saw that the number still hasn't gone up, despite having eaten a lot more over the past week. So I decided to eat a bowl of cereal, a banana and some chocolate after dinner and now I feel really full and bloated. My stomach feels so tight, I haven't felt like this in a long time.

It's so frustrating, because I really am trying my best to gain weight now. But my mom thinks I'm playing tricks on her because the number just isn't going up. 

I hate how my stomach feels right now. I might take a little digestion walk. Nothing too hard on my body, just some movement to help me feel better.

I know it's only been a week of all in. It takes time. But still.

I am, however, proud of myself for trying."

Recovery,"Gastroparesis: Something I realized  Feeling nauseous today and my mind is fighting with my body on this. My mind is saying, ‘Restrict’, but my body is saying to eat. I am going to listen to my body and eat. I had really bad gastroparesis flares for years due to my ED/lax abuse. Looking back on it, whenever I struggled with ED induced GP/delayed stomach emptying, my body would always encourage me to eat a lot of food even on the days I felt the sickest. Like screaming, ‘EAT!’ It always seemed  counterintuitive, but the only thing that actually helped my GP symptoms (not even Zofran/Phenergan would help sometimes) was eating food pretty much constantly (sometimes the worst GP flare would be resolved with giving in to extreme hunger looking back on it and ‘binging’. I guess it explains why GP will eventually resolve with normal eating habits. I don’t know. Just something that occurred to me today."

Why the fuck was I too afraid of talking to ppl, like r y fucking stupid I had a year and a half online in school fuck you. Why the hell didn’t I choose the major that was better financially and also interests me vs the one I chose when I was 17 and just stuck with it because I wanted a year off and couldn’t get it so I just STAYED STUCK because my BRAIN DIDNT WORK. For two years I literally just said “brain no worky ahaha” IT WASNT FUNNY BITCH WHAT THE FUCK IM SO MAD IM SO MAD IM SO

Recovery,"My labs are normal!!  Ok well with the exception of my lipase levels which are still slightly elevated BUT this is so fantastic!! My labs were majorly fucked this time last year, to the point where they were indicating pre-organ failure. Even when I was discharged from treatment back in late December my labs were still very off-kilter. But now, after almost a year in recovery and a good 3 months of truly fueling myself in the healthiest way, the tides are turning. 

My hormone levels are still on the lower end of normal for a person my age (early-mid 20s) but that’s only going to improve with continued work. I gotta say, as shitty as my body image has been, knowing that I’m healing myself is so gratifying. It takes time y’all. A LOT of time. I was “only” restricting for a couple of years, and it took this long to balance my shit out. But our bodies are truly incredible and have an amazing capacity to heal if we give them the chance. This is a total recovery win 🌟"
Recovery,"therapist told me to not listen to extreme hunger ?  i always read that i should listen to mental and physical hunger. i asked my therapist what to do and she told me that when i ate one piece of chocolate and want more i should put it on top of my carbinet so i have to use an chair to get to the chocolate again. isn´t this like retrictive behaviour?  idk what to do now... she also said to my mum that she should stop me when she sees that i eat too much , but i know it would make me feel so bad for eating."
Recovery,"the only way out is through, it gets better but you gotta eat  I had EH for forever...and you know what? I ate. A lot. You can see my post on EH for an example of a day. I spent a week with my sister and she was positively burned out on food at the end of dealing with me (oops).

I am so sick and tired of planing my meal with a decent portion size and calorie amount and as soon as I start eating the eating induced mental hunger kicks in and it is like I am completely zoning out after that. 

I just keep on going back to get food again and again until I reach a calorie and food amount that would satisfy a grown up active man for a whole day (I am a 25f, healthy weight and 10 month in AN recovery). 
No matter how much protein, or fiber or whatever I put into the meal my mental hunger will not stop until everything in sight is devoured and I can no longer get any piece of food in me. It’s like my body switches to an autopilot that is programmed to keep on eating until nothing is left. Sometimes even food that I don’t particularly like.

I don’t want to restrict, but also not compulsively eat and finish every god damn package that I open up.
I honestly am at lost how to get back to normal (- not unhealthy) portion sizes again and not this 2 times a day crazy binge like eating style.
I wish I would know how other people here or on social media or around me can stick to eating „normal“ portions and stop after one. I feel like a complete crazy person (like >!

Recovery,"How to support girlfriend during relapse?  I hope this is the right subreddit for this, so sorry if it's not. 

My girlfriend has had a really bad anorexia relapse (she struggled with eating problems in some way her whole life apparantly, but I don't think it has been that bad before) last autumn, then started recovering in spring. (Though I am aware now it was just Quasi-Recovery, she was eating at exactly maintenance and still obsess over that number instead of the lower one from before.) Now I fear she's back to restricting more. She gained a small amount of weight since recovering, and now believes she has to lose that weight again. She's not back to eating as little as she used to, but her first relapse also started her by losing a bit of weight though light restriction.

I feel completely helpless. We are long distance, so most of our talks are through text, which makes it even more difficult to show up - When we're together in person I just offer her a hug, have meals and snacks with her so she doesn't have to eat lone, or sit with here while she's feeling down, but it's so hard to help through text only. I just don't know what to say when she talks about how fat she is, or that she doesn't deserve to eat, or that shes ""out of control"" (for eating like... a 100cals over maintenance). Rational arguments don't work, obviously, and just saying that I feel sorry or that I'm here for here starts ringing hollow, to the point she sometimes gets upset over me just repeating these things over and over again (even though I mean them). She sometimes says she wants me to to convince her to eat, but when I try I just feel like we're pointlessly arguing, and when I don't have the capacities for it (because it does take a lot out of me, unfortunately) I feel saying no hurts her because she already feels like she's a burden on me. 

I just... Don't know what to do, or what she needs from me during this time. I've asked her, and she doesn't know. I've talked to my friends, I've read through forums online, I've read self-help books for both partners of people with eating disorders and people with eating disorders, and I still just feel like I'm watching helplessly and like there's nothing I can do. I know I can't possibly safe here, but I feel like there's more I can do that just listen to her talk about how disgusting and terrible she is all day? I don't know. Is there anything that someone in this relapse stage needs to hear from a loved one that isn't basically just ""I'm sorry you're going through this"" and ""I'm here to listen to you if you want""? And what does she need to hear when she goes on a long rant about being disgusting or ""eating like a pig"" or needing to lose weight?"
Recovery,"Yo when am I gonna stop throwing up in my mouth 85 times a day?  TW: this is gross. Sorry

I used to purge a lot. For context. Can any ex-purgers tell me what your experience has been?

Deadass every single time I eat ANYTHING, I will regurgitate small amounts of it into my throat/mouth DOZENS of times over the course of several hours after eating. It feels just like a burp but there's no air. Just food that gets progressively more acidic as time passes, and it will become painful. 

Sometimes it happens to me on an empty stomach and I will have straight acid come into my mouth and burn me. It happened when I was laying down once and it got up onto my nose, eyes and ears. I cried because it burned so bad. 

I am not exaggerating when I say this happens DOZENS of times after every single meal or snack I eat. Thankfully at this point, I can anticipate it happening and swallow it before it makes it up into my mouth. And it usually makes no sound either, so people can't tell. But jesus christ. I fucking hate this. It feels disgusting and it hurts sometimes too.

I'm assuming that my gastro-esophogeal sphincter is weakened because of repetitive purging over the course of several months. So it just can't keep the shit inside my stomach anymore, I guess. I don't know :( I had an ulcer from purging and I took medication for 3 months to heal it, so my stomach is really back to normal now. I just throw up in my mouth a million times a day. :/

Did I just ruin my body forever? Also, is this going to erode my esophogus over time and hurt me? Fuck. This is all involuntary and uncontrollable so I really have no idea what to do about it, if it is damaging me. Don't do bulimia kids. I'm serious it will fucking hurt you"
Recovery,"Recently relapsed... do I need to relapse for a set amount of time before seeking treatment?  Sorry for the long post.

I had disordered eating as a teen and got into a sort of semi recovery for the past few years - I had a few small relapses of b/p and restricting, and remained clinically uw the majority of the time, and kept my stupid food rules, but overall I wasn’t too bad. 

About a week ago, though, I relapsed, and this one is looking to be a full on, bad as the first time round relapse. Problem is, I live in a house full of people who have recovered from eating disorders.

Because i recognised that the only time I’d care about their mental health more than my ed would be early on, I told the remaining roommate what is happening (which obviously I now sorely regret lol) and they’re talking about accessing treatment now. But I don’t even know what treatment at this point would look like, or if I’d have to get back down to the dangerous point I was before, or at least have this going on for an extended period of time.

Edit: to make it clear cause I realise this post is a mess, what I mean by recovery is to stop this relapse and also stop the semi recovery, mini relapsed, and become physically and mentally healthy, which I can’t seem to do without any guidance because I don’t know what’s right and what is my ed brain telling me."
Recovery,"Wait. Calories aren't even that scary...  Uhm, major revelation? I have no I idea how this crossed my mind. But I was scrolling through posts about recovery and someone talked about eating over maintenance. Ever since I stopped tracking calories, I've had no reference of what my maintenance would be. I used to calculate it almost daily, but now that number doesn't matter, since I'm not trying to stay in it anyways. 

But from what I remember, that number was ridiculously low. It couldn't have been accurate. 

When I first started recovery, it was semi-recovery. I wasn't trying to get healthy. And I was too scared to go over that ridiculous maintenance number. Looking back at it, I can recognize how incredibly restrictive my diet was. 

Now I'm much more comfortable with a higher calorie intake. My disordered thoughts creep in at weird times, like when I eat more often in the day, when I eat larger amounts of ""unhealthy"" things or when I eat fear foods. But overall, I've come such a long way :)

My memory of the time before my ED is a bit blurry. But what I know for sure, is that I had no clue about my maintenance. I didn't even know what a calorie is. I just ate whatever I wanted, as much as I wanted. Did I gain weight? No. Of course my weight fluctuated, that's normal. I was a bit chubbier at one point and I wouldn't exactly want to go back to that body at the moment. But I felt so carefree. I had lots of issues, but food wasn't one of them. 

It all began when I joined in on lent (even though I'm not Christian, but it was trendy to join in at the time) by cutting out all sweets, snacks and junk food, as well as all drinks other than water. My goal was to get clearer skin. Though I wasn't happy with my body, so the secondary goal of weight loss was added soon after. And it all went downhill from there. I thought I was doing the right thing by restricting. It was how everyone around me and on social media lost weight. I just went down this spiral very quickly, it turned into an addiction.

I wish I never found out about calories. Why couldn't I just have stayed blissfully ignorant?

But I'm determined to get back my freedom. Life is so much more enjoyable when you don't restrict your happiness."

Has anyone struggled with really bad acne during recovery? And how did you manage? Did you do anything to help?
I've suffered with an ed for 5 years, before in my young teens I had acne but it cleared and during my ed I has zero acne. I increase my intake last year a bit and reintroduced sugar and I got some acne. I finally started recovering about 3 months ago and my acne spiraled out of control, never like before. Nd I'm afraid it will leave scarring. At this point im honestly more insecure about my acne than my body. I supposed it had to do with the introduction of sugar but also the hormonal change. I know every body is different but I haven't seen many in recovery who's acne appeared then. Any tips?"

Disordered,"Am I the only person here who thinks BED is an actual eating disorder and isn’t just mental hunger?  DISCLAIMER: There is nothing wrong with eating as a response to emotions. Humans do it all the time. It becomes a problem when the food is no longer helping you (difficult to define, I know. It’s something you define over a long term pattern of behavior, and with the help of a nutritionist. If you suspect you are binging, talk to your treatment team)

And that while EH and MH are real and should be honored, it’s important to be vigilant about binging behaviors even though they are not as harmful as restriction? And when one does notice binging, it is a sign that some sort of restriction is happening somewhere else and that something needs to change?

I’ve been weight restored for 2 years. I eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and 2 snacks. Once or twice a week I make my way down to the kitchen and consume half a container of Parmesan, half a thing of PB, leftovers scooped out of containers with my hand while standing in front of the fridge, and various baking ingredients like a bowl of brown sugar and chocolate chips. To me, this is both physically and emotionally unpleasant but is also a pleasure seeking behavior. And there is a clear pattern to it; I do it at night and especially if I’ve been socializing or drinking. THIS IS BINGING. It is not driven by hunger, mental or otherwise. I have intense social anxiety, and I eat to calm myself. Or if I have even one drink (I’m a lightweight) I am consumed by a desire to make my life fun and entertaining in that moment, and I do it with food.

I ordered what I wanted rather than what was ‘healthy’ or likely to be lower in calories (the calories weren’t actually on the menu which was delightful). Well, what I **really** wanted was steak but I’m not made of money 😅 so I ordered what looked next best, and it had an ingredient I didn’t even know in it!

Recovery,"Day 5 of going all in  Are you guys sick of me yet? lol

So, I'm feeling really good today. Honestly, I think I feel better on days I don't give in to any restrictions and just have what I want. Today was one of those days.

Breakfast was my usual: cereal with a sandwich, this time with sourdough bread. It was quite filling and satisfying. At work, I had my coffee with a biscoff biscuit. I drink my coffee black, because I've learned to love the pure coffee flavor. Even if I wasn't scared of liquid calories, I'd still have it black. I do try to have cookies with my coffee though and it's amazing everytime.

Today I only had to work until 2:30, so I had lunch at home. And guess what? I FINALLY HAD A PAIN AU CHOCOLAT. I ended up not having one yesterday. But my mom brought fresh ones today and I had one, along with an apple. Sadly, it wasn't nearly as good as I remember, but I'm still glad I had it. Now I satisfied that craving. I had a slight stomach ache afterwards, though I'm not sure why. Maybe I'm not used to having pastry? Dunno..

Dinner was fish sticks with potatoes, cooked veggies and a little side salad. My mom gave me shit for not adding any dressing, but I genuinely don't really like salad dressing. Leave me be lmao

And for dessert, I had [this coconut-almond ice cream](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LN0R8EXxL._SL1476_.jpg) which I've been wanting to try for months now, but I've been too scared to challenge it. Until today. The white chocolate had coconut flakes and it was the best part. The ice cream itself wasn't that special, just vanilla ice cream with a slight touch of coconut. Still, I'm glad I had it. I could have had a lower calorie one, but i decided to listen to what I truly wanted. (The ice cream was okay, but [the chocolate bar](https://www.worldofsweets.de/out/pictures/master/product/2/raffaello-tafel-90g-no2-1027.jpg) and the original [praline](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tCwhvPbTL._SL1000_.jpg) are a 10/10. A must try for anyone who loves coconut)

Tomorrow I'm in charge of dinner and I plan on making ramen. It'll be simple, just a spiced up version of instant ramen by adding fresh veggies and maybe marinated eggs. I haven't eaten ramen in so long. It used to be my ultimate comfort food, but my ED turned it into one of my biggest fear foods for no reason. I kinda want to slap my ED in the face by adding chili oil or something, but that might be too big of a challenge for now.

And Sunday my family and I will go swimming at the pool we used to visit all the time when we were younger. And a part of every visit was to eat the trashy yet somehow comforting fast food they offered. That, or McDonalds. Fast food hits different when you go swimming and smell like chlorine lol

We haven't gone swimming in years. And I'm already so excited for it. It'll be a huge nostalgia kick. And to make the experience as nostalgic as possible, I want to have the trashy fast food. It's just part of the experience. I won't let my ED take that from me, nuh uh.

This is your sign to eat something that reminds you of your childhood or of a happy memory. Food can make an already enjoyable experience even more memorable. I hope to create many more happy memories for myself :)"
Recovery,"Am I allowed to eat something if I am not hungry and do not crave it?  I want to recover but I also do not want to fall into the spiral of eating something every second of the day just because I have nothing better to do (that is what got me to gain and that’s how my ED era started).

I noticed that normal people usually just eat on their meal time and I don’t know if it would be healthy to eat without a reason."
Recovery,"The pain of having an eating disorder  Having an eating disorder is being in constant mental agony, day and night. there's hardly any room for real joy or connection with people around you when you are sick with an eating disorder. you are starving yourself, so your body can only focus on the food you are eating, when you will get it and how much. Yet, you are afraid of eating and afraid of gaining weight at the same time. to suffer from anorexia nervosa feels like you are being tortured. and like you can't escape it. your thoughts become gray and you feel so alone. If you suffer from the illness long enough, you will get used to being in pain. when people try to step in and tell you have a serious illness and you need help, it feels threatening to you. this illness is all that you know and you are so used to it by now, some days you feel like you would rather die than give it up. that's the tragedy of life with an eating disorder. you know what's happening to you is unhealthy and you know you need help, yet you keep going. then you develop medical complications, end up in the hospital and realize how sick you actually are. I think the hardest thing about having anorexia is the effect it has on your mind. because you feel like your own mind is against you. yet there's a comfort in the illness, and that's why it's so deadly and hard to recover from. an eating disorder isn't fun or cute. it's painful for the individual and heartbreaking for everyone who loves the person. I wish that I did not suffer from one and that I was healthy"
Recovery,"Are therapists obliged to call the police or admit you to a clinic when they find out you're anorexic?  I just haven't told her yet and I'm worried she might get others involved if I she knew since anorexia technically risks your life. For now, I just want to talk to her bc that's already a big step."
Recovery,"feeling guilty for not feeling guilty  i think everyone in recovery know this: sometimes you have very good days and sometimes bad days. for me today is a good day ( or was ) . i ate and didnt even feel guilty but NOW i feel guilty bc i didnt feel guilty of eating you know what i mean ? i have the feeling that i´m getting healthy too fast and that an ""normal anorexic "" in recovery always feels guilty abt eating. god am i the only one who feels like this ?"
Recovery,"I added up the calories  Why did I do that. Why the fuck did I do that. That was really fucking dumb. And I’m still fucking hungry, why am I still hungry??? And it’s so fucking hot so and I can’t wear anything but revealing clothes and I can just see my body. And I’ve done nothing all fucking day because you can’t go outside without melting. 

Aughhh why is this so hard?????"
Recovery,I had the most vivid dream about purging last night and I’ve only gone and relapsed today what the hell is wrong with me I’m never gonna escape this cycle  
Recovery,"New Job Advice  Hey guys! I’m in recovery from R-AN, at a healthy BMI, and I’m starting a new job on Monday. It’s a busy hospital post. 

Wondering if anyone has any advice for me? Im still needing a lot of calories per day, particularly if I’m moving about a lot or I get low BP/blood sugar. It has been discussed I can take snack breaks and keep a snack/glucose tabs on me, but I’m not used to eating in front of new people or in busy rooms, and I’m still very self conscious of eating more and energy dense foods than others. It’s also a much earlier start and I struggle to eat a lot in the mornings!

Hey y’all 👋🏻 I just joined but I have a lot going on. I’m 31 & a mother of two autistic girls & I’ve been with my husband (their dad), who is also autistic, for 12 years now & life is great. But it’s not. I have bipolar disorder & GAD & panic disorder & I’m medicated for all the above. Sometimes I feel lonely, like the outsider in my household. I lost a bulk (no numbers!) of weight last year by restrictive eating & it was a trauma response. Here I am a year later & I *think* I may have an ED? But then again, I feel like there’s no way, I’m too *insert any derogatory body image adjective* to have an ED. If I did, I’d be UNDERweight & not a “healthy” weight, which my BMI (I know, I know) says I am “healthy/normal.” There’s so many things I admittedly don’t know about ED. As a matter of fact, I thought there was only two until earlier today 🤯 I just don’t know what to do. As if maybe I’m teetering on something, or I’m already deep in the hole, or I’m overly dramatic as usual. 

This is a text I sent to my husband:

“I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, about myself & my problems & my own self loathing & hatred & I think I’ve come to terms with with something, a sort of revelation that I’ve actually suspected for awhile but imagined it couldn’t be possible because of how I look. 

I don’t even know how to come out & say it? But I’m almost positive that I have an eating disorder? 

I’ve thought this for awhile, but I also thought, “I can’t be f*t & have an eating disorder.” But all I do is stress & panic about food. Eating or not eating. Restricting my food & calories for days, then eating copious amounts, sometimes even in secret, then barely eating the next day to compensate for what I did to myself the day before. Weighing myself constantly. Multiple times a day & feeling so much self hatred whenever I’ve gained anything at all. But feeling empowered & proud if I’ve lost anything. I’ve never told you this, but I’m going to, I’ll even use suppositories to make myself go to the bathroom before I weigh myself just so I can see a lower number on the scale.

When I was the biggest I ever was, & you weren’t able to have sex with me, I figured it was because you weren’t attracted to me, because of my body. So, I started to lose weight & then we were intimate again. But then I started (still do) having this all consuming fear of getting that size again. But then I didn’t wanna be the size I was…& that’s never stopped. It’s all I think about. & I do “good,” by restricting my calories & food for a few days & then I binge like crazy. I’ll eat two sandwiches & three bags of chips & a cookie & a bowl of cereal, all within in ten minutes, not even taking a moment to fucking breathe. Then I’ll feel suicidal like I’m so fucking gross. 

& this is why I have such a poor self image. This is why I absolutely hate myself & hate what I see & why I feel like you hate what you see. I think I have an eating disorder & I need help because it’s spiraling”

I just don’t know. I’m so uneducated. Also, the intimacy with my husband that was mentioned was never because of my weight. *I* felt that way for years, so it caused me a lot of sexual trauma & PTSD regarding sexual intimacy with him & a ton of body image issues for myself. After years of that, it ended up being a physical thing for him in his neck, that has since been corrected by spine surgery. & yet, my BRAIN won’t accept that reality. There’s years of trauma to undo & it doesn’t happen over night. I just wanna mention that 🥲"
Recovery,dumb triggers  i really wanted to have greek yogurt with breakfast but we’re out so i went to the store and bought the cheapest thing of greek yogurt but it’s the kind with added sugar and it’s also the kind that’s in individual containers so i know exactly how many portions i would be having and i would know exactly how many calories and sugar i would be consuming even after covering it up with sharpie and i lost my appetite 😐🔫 like i literally will have this thing where if i know the calories in something or if i know how “unhealthy” it is i’ll just lose my whole fucking appetite. at least it was only $3 so i didn’t waste that much money.
Recovery,"What's the difference between binging and extreme hunger? And how long does the latter last after starting recovery?  edit: Idk how to add ""ED Question"" to the post, could somebody please tell me how to do that?
edit: ok, now I know!"
Recovery,"recovery dilemma  so i know the negative effects of exercise during recovery. however, my minor at school is dance and as such i have a couple of dance classes and related things i am supposed to do in this upcoming semester. i lost a lot, probably pretty much all my muscle mass this summer as such i need to build up my strength again in order to dance, but i don’t want to do anything that puts me in danger. any ideas on what the best course of action would be?"
Recovery,"Can't get past this mental struggle  I am an avid planner; I always decide what I'll eat, approximately when (whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner or evening snack, times vary slightly), and most importantly HOW much I'll eat.

Take today as an example; for breakfast I have my normal bowl of granola with a banana. Lunch is two slices of toast with some sour cream, around 150 grams of salmon, veggies and a glass of milk. Dinner is going to be half a pizza, and evening snack is a bowl of granola with two small cups of yoghurt.

I feel like this is ""maximum"" of what I'm allowed, and even this is me eating beyond fullness, physically speaking. But what if I want a cup of hot chocolate? What if I want some scoops of ice cream, or a couple rows of toblerone or other candy? I ""can't"" fit it into my day of eating, and if I did I would substitute it with something else, but I already WANT all the things I'd planned to eat.

I know the answer to this struggle is probably ""just eat all you planned AND chocholate, ice cream, hot chocolate etc.""; but it's so much easier said than done."
Recovery,So what’s the difference between a binge and extreme hunger?  
Disordered,"struggling with recovery  just as a disclaimer ig i don't think i have an ed and i've never been diagnosed with one. i'm in recovery from severe malnutrition and one of the other subs i posted in said that y'all might have some good advice

i'm now just over a month out from a doctors visit where i was nearly hospitalized (they ended up agreeing to outpatient treatment as long as i follow the treatment plan which was 3 meals a day plus snacks supplements). both my parents were there at the appointment with me and heard this stuff. physically, it's been going well so far i do still struggle obviously but generally i feel a lot better overall (more energy, less nausea, less depression, etc)

but my main issue is that my mom has these really bad body image issues i guess and she keeps projecting them onto me. like she won't shut up. it's only been a few weeks and i still get bouts of dizziness and she's already telling me i'm getting too fat and i need to start exercising to ""make up for everything i'm eating"" and i need a flat stomach and on and on and on nitpicking everything. i'm still literally underweight because it's only been a few weeks and i'm struggling to figure out what amount of food i should be eating (because my idea of that was so skewed earlier) and i really don't know how to deal with this. she's kind of always been critical like this but she's just now started becoming this vocal about it. i could be peacefully eating lunch and she comes up to me and tells me to make sure i don't put on too much weight and that i shouldn't get fat.

i guess how do i deal with this? i genuinely want to recover but i feel like my mom is trying to give me an eating disorder and i've never been one of those people who could just do the ""in one ear out the other"" thing that everyone keeps telling me to do. moving out is also not an option at least for a few months. i've found myself internalizing some of what she's saying already and i really don't want to go there"
Disordered,"im tired.  Last year was the first time I ever was able to lose weight and look the best and healthiest I’ve ever looked/felt. I’ve been diagnosed with BED for about a year, but have struggled with a constant binge/restrict battle for the past decade. February of this year I reached my healthiest self at my lowest weight - I felt amazing, my confidence was up, I was dating, I actually went out on the weekends, and life was fun. I was restricting heavily, doing OMAD, but it was easy. Ever since reaching my lowest weight, I’ve been gaining back all the pounds I lost. I’ve tried countless times to get back into the “honeymoon phase” although I know it probably won’t ever come back. I can’t restrict at all like I used to, and can only last one or two days if I can, before I binge. I can’t even get myself to workout - even though I enjoy exercising, it’s like my mind throws a tantrum when I think about hitting my daily movement goals (nothing crazy either). Unlike last year when I lived alone and had more control over my environment, I’m living with my family who prioritizes cooking. Most of the time the meals aren’t “safe” or healthy enough for me, and being home with them has made it harder to stay distracted from tempting snacks and treats. This also means I’m not able to count calories anymore. 
Theres nothing I want more than to be back in restriction, exercising, and making progress. The only time motivation hits is when I’m sick of binging and begin daydreaming about getting back on track by restricting and losing weight. 
There are time where I think I want to focus on recovery and eating an adequate amount to keep me full while also losing weight in a healthy way. But this makes me feel even more like a failure. It’s like I won’t allow myself to lose weight unless I do it through starving :( I am just a little tired."
Recovery,"I discovered my ED exactly one year ago.  One year ago today, I made this account because I felt like there's something wrong with my relationship with food. Damn. It's been lots of ups and downs. But I'm so glad I started recovery when I did. I might not have been dealing with my ED as long as others, but it still was hell. And I still have a long way to go ."
Recovery,"Chosing to end my pro-ed friendship.  *Choosing

Hi everyone! I would love to hear about similar experiences to this and could really use some support. 

A little backstory: I've had an eating disorder for several years. I developed it at 19. At some point I gave recovery a shot and it didn't last long and I relapsed. For the next few years I'd go months or years deep in my ed but then interspersed by small bouts of trying to recover. 

Well, since 2020 I have been able to make my small recovery bouts longer and longer. Things were going very well in 2021 and I was in recovery for almost the entire year until winter. I relapsed in winter up until now. During this time I made friends with someone on Edtwt and we would write everyday about our eds. Not just the struggles but our current goals and things like that. Now we are friends on our personal Instagrams and other platforms.  

Fast forward to now: next month I am moving and between wanting to start my new life on the right foot and also feeling soo soooo incredibly drained by my Ed I really want to try my best to try to recover again. 

Here's my problem; I do feel triggered by my pro-ed friend. I really like her and am feeling guilty about wanting to end the friendship. 

""Why cut it off instead of just create boundaries over ed stuff and just be normal friends?"" you may ask. Well, she's really struggling with her Ed too and it's a big part of her life right now. It is always something we talk about even when we try not to.

We've also tried recovering together before and I do feel like right now I'd be very triggered if we did this again and she relapsed. It would trigger me to relapse I feel. She's not trying to recover now either. 

I think this is a journey I need to take on my own but I feel super guilty. I also feel like the friendship inherently reminds me of Ed topics a lot even when we do discuss other stuff. This is a big part of it actually - there's just a part of me that doesn't feel able to recover when we are friends. 

Has anyone else been in this position before? Please don't judge me for this. I feel really bad about it but I think it's what might be best for me."
Recovery,"Finally gave in  I have been avoiding the foods I crave. Especially throughout the day. Yes, I know it's restriction. I know I have been. Tonight though, after my planned 8:30 snack, I realized I was still unsatisfied. I kept thinking about the granola and almonds in the cabinet. 

So I got up, and served myself. I even added a frozen gogurt because, damn, they are good. 

Is the eating disorder mad, ofc. 

Am I happy? heck yeah. I'm satisfied for once. 

I don't want to be scared of weight restoration. I can't be scared of food anymore. 

I just want a job. I just want to be free to walk as much as I want. I need me back."
Recovery,"Eating feels urgent  Even though I am allowing all foods in any quantity, it feels absolutely urgent that I cram as many calories in my body as I can RIGHT NOW. I’m not underweight in the slightest. I recently had a mini relapse but I don’t understand how it warrants all this food. It seriously feels like I’m being timed and I have to eat X amount of calories in like an hour. Does anyone else have this extreme urgency to eat?"
Recovery,late night sweet snacks are the best  just broke my no eating after 9pm food rule and had melon bread :)
Disordered,Honestly couldn’t restrict now if I tried  It’s been a little over two months of recovery for me and I feel like if I even attempted to restrict my body legit would not allow it. Like all that self control that became a complete lifestyle for 7 years has been erased in two months of eating well. I’m not sure if I should feel happy or scared or what? Has anyone else experienced this?
Disordered,"support  im 15, 6 months jn recovery and desperately needing support - on the verge of relapse idk what to do"
Recovery,"day 4, evening 5 of all in recovery  anyone else hit a point of apathy towards food? like i get super duper hungry and than i prepare a decent meal (by that i mean throwing tofu into some leftover ramen and a half of a melon bun - one of my favourite snacks that i almost never have because it’s so hard to find) and i just feel… nothing? i ate more or less mechanically because i stopped being hungry after the first few bites and it was a small enough portion to not be worth bothering throwing it back in the fridge (plus i’m leaving tomorrow anyways and i don’t want to leave food behind) and now i’m kind of unsure if i’m full or hungry. it’s weird, i was so excited when i found the melon bun at the bakery yesterday (i can remember the last time i had one - it was in february of 2020, i was on a trip to seattle, and that was a time in my life where my ED was basically nonexistent) and than i actually had half of it with dinner (i like to pair something sweet with all of my meals) and it was… fine, i guess. maybe i’m just in a general low mood because i haven’t ate much today or just because i’m bummed out about leaving my mom’s place tomorrow or something. 

i will say that this food apathy kind of goes both ways. i had lunch with a friend today and it was a decent meal - i had something called a “bilbao wrap” (idk if this is specific to the place i went to or if it’s a common term sorry) an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, and a chai tea latte (which even a week ago the idea of unknown liquid calories would have been daunting to me - so that’s a fear food challenged) at a mexican cafe and i wasn’t even thinking of the calories. i was thinking wow, this wrap is tasty, i like the pear and the cheese, i like this cookie, this latte is hot, etc. there was no sense of guilt about eating, i was enjoying my meal, chatting with my friend and her friend who works at the restaurant, and in general i had a really great time catching up with her. 

i just have such weird hunger signals. like i’ll be hungry as hell and than i won’t even be halfway to the kitchen before it dissipates. but i know i have a lot of mental hunger, but usually that just results in me thinking about food as like, a concept, as opposed to having a specific craving. or like, i’ll crave something, but it’ll be unattainable (like i’ll be hit with a craving for peanut butter when i’m out of the house and can’t have any, and than by the time i get home the craving is just gone) so i can’t really honour it. it would be nice just once to have a craving that i can honour on the spot. maybe i’m out and about too much for somebody who’s recovering (it probably wouldn’t kill me to do a bit less walking) but i just get bored being cooped up inside all the time, i like to get out and take photographs, and just explore the neighbourhood.

tomorrow i’m heading back to my dad’s and i’m looking forward to the road trip. i might get some snacks i’ve been really craving for the ride back or i might just find some interesting places on the way there. i can’t handle chain restaurants because of calorie counts on menus (the law here is that any restaurant with more than 10 locations has to list calories) but honestly that just means i get to have more exciting food."
Recovery,I’m scared I might be binging  I’m in recovery and I just can’t stop eating. I don’t even restrict anymore but at night the urges to just eat entire boxes of cereal and cookies are there. Literally minutes ago I’ve had lunch and then went to the kitchen to eat bowls of cereal and plain cold bagels. My stomach is hurting bad and I feel awfully guilty. Is this binging?
Recovery,"making progress  this recovery thing actually works????
the last two days have been amazing: ive been eating with close to zero guilt despite eating a lot, i tried so many of my childhood favorite snacks & meals, and my thoughts werent entirely absorbed in food??? like what?? as soon as i thought of a certain food item, i ate it and moved on with doing what im doing? i mean, i had good days in recovery before but never rlly experienced anything like it. it felt so freeing - both days my brain didnt even add up the calories. though i noticed a pattern of a few good days -> a few bad days and so on… im aware that recovery isnt linear and that if i keep sticking to it, soon enough the bad ones will decrease whereas the good ones will *increase*. im just so happy seeing that all my hard work isnt for nothing <3"
Recovery,"Really need some support right now (extreme hunger, again) TW: calories and weight  Hello! Sorry for the grammar errors, i'm french. It's my second month of recovery and i'm still experiencing extreme hunger (I don't know how to mask it, but I ate between 6,000-10,000cal a day). I've gain a lot of weight already and I can't fit in my clothes anymore. I was anorexic as a way to cope with dark thought and s/h. Now that I eat more regularly, those thought are coming back and it's worst with the weight gain. I feel like that extreme hunger will never end and I'll become obese again (before anorexia, my BMI was really high and i've lost over 110 pounds). I'm trying my best to accept the weight gain and telling myself that it's okay if I become overweight, but it's really hard right now. Does anybody have any tips ? I'm really in a dark place right now and some support will be appreciated 🥲"
Recovery,"going back to treatment  i started my first round of treatment about a year ago and was doing really well for a long time. i recently relapsed and have an evaluation with a treatment center back home (different from the first treatment center) in a few weeks. 

my weight is better than it was before my first round of treatment but overall i have recently lost a significant amount of weight according to my dietician. i’m hoping the new center will take me but of course i’m stressing about whether i’m “sick enough” to get a spot there. i’m trying to eat as much as i can to prepare but it’s a constant battle in my head. does anyone have advice for this stage of recovery?"
Recovery,"Day 4 of going all in  Guys, I finally had cake! Yay :) It was a piece of the plum cake my boss brought to work yesterday. Honestly, it was very underwhelming, but I wanted to try it. That, along with two cookies I had with my coffee, was my lunch. Breakfast was two sandwiches (one with honey, banana and cinnamon, the other with chicken cold cuts, cream cheese and lettuce).

And just now for dinner I had three pancakes with honey, cinnamon and blueberries. I'm very full right now, actually. My mom brought a pain au chocolat for me from the bakery she works at. It'll be stale tomorrow. I'm not hungry, nor am I really craving anything right now. But maybe I'll still eat it later? I'm not sure. After dinner, I thought I ate a lot today.

But, like yesterday, writing down everything I ate today makes me realize that it wasn't that much. It was all very calorie dense though. Which makes me feel like I've made some great process :) Instead of having lots of low calorie things today, I ate in a smaller volume, just with more calories. And it was a very sweet day lol the only savory thing I had was that second sandwich for my breakfast. I'm learning to embrace my sweet tooth again <3

You know what? Now I do want to eat the pain au chocolat. I'm scared I'll regret it though. Hmm

&#x200B;

Edit: Okay. I'm not sure how to feel about it, but I counted everything together. And I really didn't have a lot today. I'm still thinking about that pain au chocolat. And I'm still physically very full. I hate that I counted calories to figure out whether I can/should have more to eat. I'll go to bed soon anyways, so I'm questioning if it's really worth it to eat more now. I am satisfied. Or maybe not? I mean, I wouldn't be calculating if I wasn't mentally hungry for that pain au chocolat. But at the same time, the thought of eating makes me a bit nauseous right now. It's though."
Recovery,"got reality checked hard by the doctors, need to start recovery now  (TW: weight, bmi, numbers) so idk if anyone saw my post from earlier today but i went to the doctors office today by request of my parents and i was very very scared. however, now i feel like it probably was for the best. i learned today that at 5 ft 5 in, i am >!91 lbs!< and my bmi is >!15.4!<. this is fucking terrifying to me i don’t want to die and i don’t want to lose any more weight. i can not live like this anymore, and i need to change my behavior NOW. should i just start eating more food or should i try to structure my recovery. i am already planning on finding a therapist and possibly a treatment center."
Recovery,"Somebody please scare me  So I've purged again, and it's frustrating me. I'm also starting to think that its okay for me to purge once or twice a week, instead of multiple times per week like I used to. Because hey, at least its a lot less now right?? I have this stupid idea that maybe because I'm purging a lot less now there's also less negative effects/consequences. Sort of like tricking myself into a so-called ""happy balance"". I know that's not obviously good to think in anyway whatsoever. Can somebody please scare me about this? Like tell me the risks, harm, or anything at all please? I figured scaring myself is kind of effective. I just hope I can finally stop purging in my trying to recover, but now I'm just feeling so lost, hopeless and I don't know what to do. Thank you all for the support :("
Recovery,"I'm burntout and touch-starved  I've had anorexia + bulimia all my life and always had periods of exceptionally long dry spells - like 3 years now. But since I'm getting used to feeding my body more to provide for my family, I'm slowly sinking into the giant abyss that is my non-existent romantic life. I feel like crying all the time and have to hide my chronic fatigue to seem ""normal"" and not a liability"
Disordered,"TW My friend confiding in me that she regrets recovery  Please delete if this isn't allowed but I needed to talk about this somewhere... also please don't read this unless you're firmly in recovery or recovered already because I don't want anyone to use it as an excuse. She's just one person and the only person I've spoken to who feels this way so please don't take it to heart 

Anyway I have this friend, let's call her T... we both met in an ED support group thing like 7 years ago now, and she had already been committed to recovering for 5 years prior to that. All of those years ago T had been my number one recovery idol, and I realise that it's important to focus on yourself but she was really inspirational to me. T had struggled with what wasn't yet called orthorexia for about 2 years in her late teens and although she wasn't physically ill and everyone was praising her for how healthy she was, the obsessions and compulsions were ruling her life. She got therapy and ditched all her food rules and seemed so happy and positive when I met her. 

Well recently, we met up for the first time since I started to take my own recovery seriously about a year ago. I'd gained a lot of weight but I thought out of everyone in the world she wouldn't judge me for it... she told me that when she first started recovery she was really really hungry and ate tonnes and tonnes every day (same as my experience rn) and was encouraged to keep eating and eating by everyone around her trusting that eventually it would stop if she didn't go back to restricting. She doubled her body weight over the course of a year and a half but even now 13 years later she says she's still constantly eating and is experiencing a bunch of health issues due to her weight. She then warned me to not go down the same route and that obesity is no better than starving yourself.... all to me, someone currently in the obese bmi range in active recovery. She said she regrets her recovery and wishes she had taken a slower path where she didn't ""become addicted to hyper palatable foods""

Needless to say I feel devastated. I told a friend about this to check if I'm the crazy one for being upset and she said she didn't know how to tell me but she's also getting worried by the fact I don't seem to be stopping my weight gain.. I cried for an hour in the bathroom after that. I feel so hurt."
Disordered,"Struggling in recovery vs relapse  I’ve been in recovery for just over two and a half years and noticed that recently I’ve been having more disordered thoughts and a harder time with food. I’ve seen my doctor and I was really taken by surprise that they’ve decided to refer me to secondary care services on an outpatient basis rather than a primary care setting. 

I feel like a fraud or that I’ve failed my recovery attempt. It feels important to me to not break my streak as I was really proud of myself for being in recovery for 2 years after being unwell for 10 years. 

Guess I was just wondering how people define relapses since ✨recovery isn’t linear✨?"
Disordered,"about to go to the doctor and scared as hell  i’ve had a pretty bad relapse this summer being home from school and my parents decided to make themselves feel better about not doing anything earlier have decided that one week before i move back in i have to visit the pediatrician that i used to go to when i was a kid. i do not want to do this at all, but they say it’s the only way i will be “allowed” to move back to school. i just don’t see the point in seeing this doctor who isn’t going to tell me anything i don’t already know. i have plans to see the doctor and therapist at school, which i will be around for the rest of the semester. im also scared the doctor will be like “they are doing too bad can’t go back to school sorry!” and my parents will
listen and keep me here. i can’t get better here i just feel so stressed out all the time and my parents don’t understand what it’s like to have anorexia they can’t even say the words anorexia or eating disorder out loud. anyway this is pretty much just a rant birthed from my current overwhelming fears, if anyone has any reassurance or advice they could give about anything here i would appreciate it."
Disordered,not sick enough for treatment TW  yup i got my lab results and bc they are just at the edge of the deadly state i´m not allowed to go to treatment. i cant eat enough at home and i dont get a psychologist until november so yeah i think that means relapse
Disordered,I want to eat and gain weight but I can't eat.  
Recovery,"bread  i love bread so much 😭 idk why i let diet culture or my ed or anybody else tell me bread isn’t good for you. or that it’s “Empty Calories” (your body NEEDS calories PERIOD especially in recovery, we don’t call fuel that comes from a shitty gas station “empty gas” because it’s not premium or ideal) or not filling i had two slices while cutting up bread for french toast and honestly that feels like a decent breakfast for now. and this is unrelated but im also proud of myself because i broke TWO food rules at once (no meal can be just carbs + no eating less than twelve hours after last eating)"
Recovery,"screwed up by going back and forth in recovery. trying to get back on track  so my dumbass started faltering as early as 1.5 months into recovery. i had extreme mental hunger and gained weight very quickly (yes some of it was water but a lot was real weight) and it did slow down as i got closer to my set weight range. but i was appalled at how much i was eating and how much that i gained in a short amount of time that i really thought i screwed up recovery and just had bed. the fact that my eh was entirely mental did not help. my physical hunger cues were barely present until i was almost weight restored. it did and still makes me feel invalid. anyways looking back i was definitely still malnourished bc every time i tried to restrict i would immediately get so hungry i would be in physical pain and have low blood sugar. but i thought eating so much just screwed my body up or something idk. i got caught in a bad cycle of restricting, then realizing anorexia isn’t worth it, then when i decided to eat again it would be a relatively normal amount for a day or two, but then i’d have an inevitable binge that would scare me off into restriction again. there was a brief period where i was eating pretty normally and maintaining my pre ed weight for a couple weeks, but then i had a crazy “binge” week out of nowhere (this was when i got my period back) and i overshot as a result and i felt horrible about myself and went back to restricting and the cycle continued. if i could just accept the extra weight on my body and not freak out and immediately go back to restricting i could actually make progress. but i had preconceived ideas in my head that if i overshot then i failed recovery (which i now know is not true at all) but at this point i do not care about my weight. i just want be well. i would rather have overshoot weight than be trapped in the never ending binge/purge/restrict cycle. i never used to make myself throw up, but this week i’ve b/ped 3 times and i know it can’t go on any longer. as much as my brain tells me going back to anorexia will fix things i know it won’t, it’s literally what started all of these problems in the first place. i kept trying to rush recovery bc i wanted to be in a good place when i went back to school in the fall but now i’m gonna have to take the semester off to sort myself out. i feel like such a failure but having any responsibilities on me right now stresses me out and makes me want to rush recovery which just ends up making things worse. i would keep trying to go back to restriction bc it feels like a quick solution in the moment but ik long term it’s not sustainable. ik people are quick to say recovery binges are just extreme hunger but i really do think going back and forth in recovery has made me develop bed/bulimia tendencies. bc sometimes i will eat until satisfaction but i’ll be bloated and feel so guilty that i’ll purge and then it turns into a b/p session when i could’ve just sat with the discomfort of an extra few hundred calories and moved on with my life instead of binging on thousands upon thousands. i think at this point i need to get rid of all responsibilities and be 100% focused on my recovery. but i feel like such a clown. other people can recover while working and doing college and i can’t. it stresses me out too much. it’s only been 4 months but it feels like it’s been ages somehow and like i’ve tried every approach in the book and come up unsuccessful every time. i can’t believe it’s taken me this long to realize that i let my unrealistic expectations completely fuck up my recovery and i’m upset with myself. i’m struggling to figure out how to move on from here. i’m thinking of doing outpatient treatment but my brain loves to gaslight me into thinking that i don’t need it bc i am unable to restrict successfully even though restriction isn’t the only ed behavior and i’m clearly a mess right now. my dabble into bulimic behaviors has further screwed up my fullness cues and i just want normal hunger signals. i’m just mad at myself for being so stupid and trying to cope with the discomfort of recovery through unsustainable behaviors."
Disordered,Back home  So I’m back in my parents house for the next two weeks and they are unaware of my eating disorder since I’ve been in college. I really don’t want to b/p while I’m here but I already feel so guilty about the snacks I’ve eaten 😞
Disordered,"how do i stop feeling guilty every time i eat?  hello

i am trying to eat more than one meal a day but i've been failing -- every time i eat a small snack (such as a slice of cold cut chicken or whatever) i obsess over it and think about it all night (as i seem to be anxious about eating when the sun is up).

i have been to outpatient and had clinically diagnosed anorexia nervosa + body dysmorphic disorder + OCD so i begin to think i've suddenly gained a lot of weight within seconds and i fixate on my appearance. i don't know what my torso is meant to look like, and i will be honest, i didn't get a lot of help from that when i was with my psych as we were trying to break my compulsive body checking

anyways, how do i stop feeling guilty? i'm fatigued from not eating, broke from spending all my money on diet products, but eating something 'full cal' makes me feel awful. thanks!"
Disordered,"every nb person i know looks underweight  how do i recover when the stereotype for non-binary people is literally anorexic?? i’m on this non-binary subreddit and like every other person who posts there looks clinically underweight. how can i completely give into recovery when it would make me an outsider in my own community and feel like giving up a big part of my gender expression???? any other nb/genderqueer folks have experience with this?

EDIT: definitely don’t want this to come across as invalidating to the all the nb and trans people of all shapes and sizes! this is mostly referring to my own admittedly skewed and disordered perceptions, as well as to stereotypes centered in media/internet/pop culture spaces. at the same time, rates of restrictive EDs genuinely are ridiculously high among NB people and the stereotype is there for a reason, however damaging it is to be exposed to."
Disordered,"Restrict as a way of desexualizing myself  Something bad happened to me when I was younger and now whenever I am sexualized I feel unsafe. Part of how I deal with this is through making myself smaller and more “childlike” through food restriction. I didn’t know I had this trauma for a long time until recently and realizing that this is a major factor in my eating disorder was like a revelation. I still don’t know how to cope in a healthier way but I’m glad I finally understand the reason why I’m doing this. At least that’s something, but I also feel so alone and damaged. Does anyone else experience something similar?"
Disordered,Physically full but still want to eat  Does this happen to anyone else ? This mostly happens after I’ve had my dinner. I’m full but the urge to eat is still there. What should I do when this happens ?
Disordered,"Hypocritical BF  Long story short.. my (32f) boyfriend (39m) of 12 years constantly says he loves my body.. that I’m not fat. Then today he comes home from dinner with a friend he hasn’t seen in while and the only way he can describe him is that he’s “gotten chunky” “he’s a fat boy”. 

So why does he think he can call other people fat but expect me to believe him when he says I’m not. This kills the progress I’ve made in therapy and recovery."
Disordered,"relapse and high cholesterol  so i kinda sorta relapsed because recovery was making me suicidal since my ed is a coping mechanism. anyways, i just got my blood test results back from the doctor, and my cholesterol levels are super high? even though i avoid dietary fats like the plague? my doctor told me to “stop eating fatty foods and eat more veggies fruits and lean meats” i was like girl…all i eat is tht. i never had an issue with high cholesterol before restriction, so i know it’s not genetic. literally what is wrong with my body"
Disordered,How do I ask the boy I’m talking to if he just likes me bc I’m skinny or what  So me n this dude have been talking for acouple months and he says he likes me we go to the same school and stuff and he saw me when I was in my Ed but now that I’m recovering I’m scared to go back to school and he sees me and doesn’t like me anymore Yk
Disordered,"Triggered at the mall  Today I decided to go to the mall and that was a bad idea. The feeling of trying on clothes and seeing sizes triggered me. I couldn’t help but compare myself to other girls that were walking around the mall. I felt fat and disgusting today, I had an anxiety attack and just felt like shit the whole day. How can I stop comparing myself to other teenage girls? How can I accept and love my body? I’m being discharged from the hospital this Friday and all I can notice is the gained weight…I feel hopeless.."
Disordered,"meal planner apps?  has anyone used a meal planner app before, does anyone have any recommendations? i want one with no calorie or nutrition information (this is vital) and no ads (this isn’t as big of a deal but would be more convenient) or in app purchases. i know i could use the notes app in my phone but i feel like having an actual separate app would be more convenient and i would actually use it more instead of forgetting about it like every other thing in my notes app…

obviously, i’m gonna have some flexibility and the meal plans i make are less “strictly follow these” and more of a “here’s what you can do if you’re stumped for ideas” type of thing. mostly for breakfasts cos i wake up not super hungry and don’t have a clue what 2 eat if i don’t plan ahead."
Recovery,"Day 3 of going all in  Today started of well, but in went downhill a bit in the evening. 
Had my usual breakfast of cereal and a sandwich. I'm still not pouring myself a big bowl of cereal though. I keep sticking to a small bowl that I don't even fill up all the way.. But I'll get there!

Then, at work, my boss brought some cake to thank us for managing things while she was on vacation for three weeks. I wanted some, I was so busy that I couldn't take a break. And when I had to leave for school, I was in a hurry to catch the bus. But maybe I'll get to have some tomorrow, they probably didn't finish all of it.

Before school, I bought a protein pudding (I was very close to buying a regular one, but I chickened out ;-;) and a salad. And I used all of the dressing :) big moment for me. I had to eat both of it quickly before class. And a classmate commented on me eating by asking ""are you hungry?"" and I'm not sure how she meant it, but it made me feel bad... Still, I was doing fine. I wasn't bloated all day, which made me feel a lot more comfortable in my body.

Today I got to cook dinner since my mom had to work late. I threw together a pasta dish from leftovers, like mushrooms, beans and green peppers from our garden, garlic and some meat. It was good, but not very filling. 
I had a banana immediately afterwards and my physical hunger was satisfied. But then mental hunger kicked in. I was craving something sweet. 
I waited two hours, still craving something sweet. So I made myself another (small) bowl of cereal. Still craving something sweet. I had these taiyaki waffles with custard filling lying around. I decided to eat one. But it didn't satisfy me, so without giving myself any time to think about it, I ate the other two I had left as well. 

And then the guilt came creeping in. I feel like I lost control, like I binged. I tried exercising for a bit but quickly realized that I'm too tired. So I took a shower and now I'm in bed, trying to make myself feel better by writing about it. I'll go to bed after this. 

I'm trying to reason with myself. My other meals weren't that big, the snacks I had after dinner made up for it, right? All in all, it was a normal amount, right? Not too much, not too little... I know there is no ""too much"" in all in recovery. I should be eating more. After all, I haven't made much progress by sticking to the same things for months. I had to change something. And I'll just have to keep going. 

Today didn't end the way I wanted it to. But that's okay. There's always tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it. I'm glad to still be here to see tomorrow. There will be no tomorrow if I go back to restricting. So I'll fight. For more tomorrow's to come."
Recovery,"struggling in recovery  ok to start off- i’m 22, non-binary, and i’ve been in treatment since mid-April of this year (withdrew from college , shit was pretty bad). started off in residential, and i have been in IOP for almost three weeks now but i’m being stepped up to PHP again tomorrow. i have been doing really poorly ever since i left PHP in the first place, so i can’t say i wasn’t anticipating the step up, but i still hate it.

here’s where i’m struggling a lot though. so i haven’t known my weight since the day i went to residential, and it’s definitely best this way. i think most of my weight restoration happened during the 7 weeks i was in res, but definitely not fully. then it slowed down a lot, and the last i heard from my dietitian (last week) i was “very close” to being fully weight restored. i suspect now that if anything, i’m a bit further away if not exactly where i was last week because i have been finding it SO DIFFICULT to meet my meal plan, especially without the accountability of being in PHP. however being in IOP for the last few weeks, i have definitely allowed my ED brain to occupy a lot more of my thoughts, and i am also REALLY struggling with hunger cues. there is also just something about being “fully weight restored” that makes my ED scream at me and frankly just makes me want to jump off a cliff. so i am falling back into old habits to avoid that. and i am scared that even with the extra support of PHP and the extra supplementation i will just fail to complete and then i really don’t know what they’re gonna do with me (put me back in res? pls no)

anyways yeah i am really struggling with the thought of no longer “deserving” to eat my meal plan bc if i am so close to being weight restored i’m obviously at a healthy weight already. i wish i could just tell my ED to shut the fuck up. this is really hard and idk what to do"
Recovery,"Challenged myself and had takeout for lunch!  Sorry to post twice in one day but I ordered Indian takeout (butter chicken, rice(!), naan, and a samosa) for lunch today because I couldn't stop thinking about it for literal days, and I was ready to pull the trigger on actually starting recovery, so I did it and I ate the whole thing and I can't believe I did!! It was delicious, Indian food is one of my favorite cuisines.

I thought I would feel terrible afterwards but honestly I just feel shocked. Feeling full for once is weird and a little uncomfortable. I feel like today will be a rollercoaster of emotions but the fact that I'm not hysterical and panicking right now is a win, and the fact that I was brave enough to order the takeout I was craving and eat the whole thing is HUGE for me, even if I feel guilty and terrible I know deep down it was the right thing to do. I'm proud of myself for finally challenging my ED, I just hope I can try to be consistent going forward and not stay stuck in quasi/relapse."
Recovery,"Do your curves come back in recovery?  Before my Ed I had curves and a big butt, my mum and sister do aswell. However bc of my Ed I basically lost it and it’s pretty much flat now..can it come back?"
Disordered,"Digestion/discomfort tips?  TW for bowel movement talk

I am very early in to recovery and the pain and constipation is real lol, sorry for the TMI but I think we are all familiar with poop issues here. Anyone have anything they do to soothe these feelings so they can continue to honor their hunger without feeling quite sick? I don’t mean to ask for any harmful tips so if this comes across that way I apologize, I’m just trying to stop the spiraling thoughts that I have destroyed my body and I will never poo again"
Disordered,"struggling in “recovery”  third full day of all in and i skipped breakfast 🫤 i thought that deleting my calorie counting app would make it easier to not restrict but i’m still doing it. i wake up and am “just not hungry” and than by the time i do get hungry it’s “too close to lunch” so i don’t even bother. spending a good half hour mindlessly scrolling through edtwt definitely didn’t help. 

i want the rest of today to be better, though. we’re going to one of my favourite restaurants to get ramen for lunch (sidebar but it’s so weird how few ramen restaurants do a vegetarian ramen that actually uses tofu as a meat substitute instead of just having a bunch of vegetables in a bowl with soup) and maybe i’ll get a nice dessert in chinatown as well, or bubble tea if it gets hot out. and maybe go to a farmer’s market this evening - hopefully there’s at least one bakery booth that does pizza buns because i could really go for one. and i suddenly want something orange flavoured as well - not sure what tho!

if you read all of this than thank you, have a nice day, go ahead and get that snack you want that your ed is telling you that you can’t have."
Disordered,"What was your first day in recovery like?  I'm at the point physically where I have to gain weight to avoid being hospitalized and tubed lol, and I think I'm (finally) at the point mentally where I can power through some of the difficult emotions of starting recovery... but I literally don't know how to start. I mean I know I need to eat more and gain weight, I'm working on getting a treatment team/support system in place, all of that. I'm talking like, I have no idea what to do in this moment to start recovery. 

It's been SO long since I've had a ""normal"" meal and I'm not really craving anything so I literally... don't know... what to eat. I don't have a meal plan or someone deciding for me. 

What did you do on your first day in recovery? How did you start the process, what foods did you start with? Did you go out and have a meal at a restaurant? Did you cook something at home? How much should I eat? How do you decide what to eat when you're not hungry? FYI my weight and how quickly I lost weight also puts me at risk for refeeding syndrome so I need to take that into account too. I really just don't know what to do, my ED habits have made it impossible to know how to eat any other way and I would love to hear what everyone's first day in recovery was like."
Disordered,"I don’t want to relapse but it almost feels inevitable at this point ..  I don’t know what’s gotten into me. I’ve been doing so well for the first two months but now I feel like giving up. I still think? I might have extreme hunger and was honoring all of it until as of very recently ( like three days ago ). I just quite literally cannot get myself to eat even when I’m starting to get physically hungry. I’ve been having multiple breakdowns a day crying at least three to five times. I just don’t know what to do. I feel more isolated than ever now in recovery than before. The physical symptoms are killing me and then not to mention the terrible body image just adding to it. I can’t even stand around or talk to my family without feeling uncomfortable I hate it. I feel like I’ve made too much progress to just give up now, and it’s my second real try at recovering and I honestly just feel completely hopeless.

Recovery,"2 Months Since My Last Purge  Feeling proud today of my progress. It has been frustrating and hard, but I’m learning how to respect and listen to my body and it’s boundaries with food.

Recovery,"how do you navigate through being in a relationship during recovery/ED struggles?  I’ve found myself having the lowest of lows ever since starting ED recovery (amongst few proud moments of course too) and wanting to isolate myself. 

My boyfriend knows that I’m pursuing recovery and is really supportive. He knows a bit about what’s going in for me and I feel the need to share with him the full extent as to what I’m going through but I think it’s just my ED brain feeling the need to explain myself because on the outside it’s telling me “I’m not sick enough” despite being underweight and even though I know how much of an emotional toll this is taking on me. 

I feel kind of insecure being in a relationship knowing that the other person knows very been diagnosed with AN because that voice in my head keeps telling me “you don’t look sick” which I know is fucked but something that plays in my mind. 

Anyway. I guess I’m just looking to hear some experiences for navigating through/talking to your partner (or other relationships) about your ED."
Recovery,what were some things that really helped you in recovery?  
Recovery,"I feel like I’m in hell  I’m at my lowest weight yet. I keep lying to my therapist about my weight, and keep throwing away the lunches my parents make for me. Today I wanted to challenge myself for lunch and I literally went to seven (7!!) restaurants before I felt safe enough to buy anything. I keep overthinking every choice I make, everything I eat. My mind is completely shattered and I’m just so exhausted. I’m too tired to even get up and clean the kitchen. It’s like I’m in some kind of hellish nightmare. I hate how I look but I just can’t eat and gain weight. Why is this happening to me?? Why can’t I just eat like a normal person? I’m 20 years old and it feels like I’m dying. Yesterday I woke up at 4 in the morning because it felt like someone was stabbing me with needles in my arms and legs, I don’t even know what that was about. The worst part is that I love food. I love sweets and pasta and bread and cream. I just hate myself. Sorry for ranting."
Recovery,"I don't believe in being fully recovered... thoughts?  Imo EDs are a lot like being an alcoholic or drug user. You're always ""in recovery"" even if you haven't had a drink in 30+ years because there are inherent differences between yourself and a non-sufferer which you will always have to guard yourself against.

 For example an alcoholic will never be able to just binge drink on a random Saturday one time like maybe a normie can and continue with their lives without it impacting them whatsoever and having no ramifications. So someone in ED recovery, even if they've been recovered for decades will never be able to go on a normie crazy crash diet (which again isn't healthy for anyone, like binge drinking isn't, but the normie can bounce back and eat a bacon sandwich the day after and not care) they will never be able to engage in those behaviours without risking a relapse.

I have always found the standard of ""fully recovered"" to be REALLY discouraging and just another thing that would drive my perfectionism nuts. I see it all the time in this sub... People who still struggle with certain thoughts or behaviours despite trying really hard to recover, sometimes for years, coming for advice,  and simply being told along the lines of ""you aren't fully recovered. Try harder."" Which isn't helpful and makes even less sense under the view that recovery is a lifelong process. In my case during the most recovered period of my life, still having thoughts just made me relapse in the end because I'd done so much work and I still wasn't the mystical ""fully recovered"" everyone preaches about so what was the point?"

Disordered,"Need help w how to deal with lack of appetite from sickness  
I’ve been trying recovery for a while (many months, am weight restored). This week I have had digestive issues (gas, gas pains and severe. diarrhea), depression, and a cold that’s dulled my sense of smell—pretty much the perfect storm for having LITERALLY ZERO appetite. Also my period if that’s relevant. 

However, I had a driving lesson and a job interview today (one in morning one in afternoon) and thought I should fuel before each of them for my mind’s sake. Then I started to get worried about how completely joyless the food was and hoped to spark my appetite later with some of my favorite foods (sushi and peanut butter chocolate ice cream). The sushi tasted like CARDBOARD. Out of the three meals and ice cream I ate today, only the ice cream tasted remotely good. 

Now ED brain is kicking myself for not “taking advantage” of a day when it would be so easy to eat nothing and hoping that I have no appetite tomorrow either so I can eat nothing. I’m also paranoid that I’m training myself to ignore my hunger signals by eating when not hungry and will build a habit of it and gain weight and just eat when it doesn’t even feel good. How do I stop fixating on this?"
Disordered,"Feel secure in recovery but intrusive thoughts r still there  The thoughts being About how I should exercise or be smaller. It’s frustrating and it rlly lowers my mood and makes me feel depressed. I’m going to talk to my psychiatrist about this tmrw. 

My dietician told me I need to just let those thoughts exist and not act on them or anything. I of course know these thoughts r irrational and I don’t want to go back to restriction because I don’t want to put my body through that anymore I really don’t. And I’ve realized how natural and normal eating is that I can’t imagine not eating regularly. Idk what the point of this is. I guess I’m just tired of my body image depressing me ?"
Disordered,"recommendation for lovers of salty food: savory dessert!  I think now that I've reached my set point, I'm less interested in sweets. Don't get me wrong, I still eat them! Slushies, cake, pie, ice cream, peanut butter cups, whatever. But overall, I've always preferred savory. 

If I'm craving a savory snack after dinner (like chips) instead of sweets, that can be my dessert. Obviously if i was on a meal plan or needing to face sweet fear foods, that would be one thing. But at this stage (a couple years into recovery, at a healthy weight, with only a handful of minor lapses), I realize it's okay to just eat what I prefer. I like salty snacks and I don't need to eat sweets just because that's typically what people eat after dinner. And I consider it an accomplishment that my body isn't desperately craving sugar like it did when I was starving myself."
Disordered,"Any other ED providers that also struggle?  I feel like a fraud sometimes because I know that I struggle when I’m not at work. Meanwhile I’m telling clients to be neutral with their bodies and try eating a fear food, yet here I am… Maybe I should change my profession.

I'm thinking of (deleted name) and similar tik tokers. The portions they show on their plate aren't small and it's stuff like pasta, bread, rice etc."
Disordered,"how do i do this  the fucking mood swings are the worst part of recovery, one second i’m proud of myself for taking things into my own hand and the next second i’m crying because i had a small slice of cake because i already had five pieces of bread with dinner and just overthinking it like i could have waited i could have drank water and stopped to see if i was really hungry etc. the thought of calories is barely at the back of my mind but i just can’t take the physical sensation of being THIS full, like i feel actually nauseous over what is probably not that large of a quantity of food."
Disordered,"scare me into recovery?  TW: talk about weight   what are things that can happen to me during my ed. basically just asking so that maybe it’ll scare me into recovery. 

 i’m 14 years old boy, >!weight 120!< and 5’4 and if i can remember i’ve been having an ed for 6 months (developed it this year). i honestly sometimes deny i have an ed and was once told i don’t have a restrictive ed because i only have a BMI of >!22.5!<  

i have notice a bit of my hair is falling off (maybe a few pieces every time i shower) it kinda scares me since i love my middle part and my hair is my absolute life.   

what specifically can happen to me during my ed other then my ed killing me and ruining my health  as a teenage boy (which is kinda sad that it isn’t enough to scare me. )"
Recovery,"all in day 2 evening 3  every day of all in i have at least one meal where i don’t even THINK about how many calories it is. the thought doesn’t even cross my mind. today that was lunch. my mom took me to this really good buffet-style vegetarian place that i hadn’t been to in ages (i don’t live in the same city as her but i’m visiting) and i had some veggies and tofu and i filled the plate as much as i wanted, which was huge for me! i went for a walk to the store to get some leeks for my mom because she’s making potato leek soup for dinner (which was one of my favourite things that she cooked for me as a child) and three separate people told me i looked good, and idk if it’s specifically related to me not counting calories for the second day in a row but it still feels super encouraging :) 

the soup is on the stove now, and i can’t wait to eat it. we have a loaf of sourdough bread that we got at the farmer’s market and bread is something i’ve been mostly avoiding unless i can ~balance out~ the carbs with something else but tonight i might just dip it straight into the soup like i did when i was a kid… and we still have left over cake from last night in case i want to get dessert after but it’s also nice enough to walk to a bakery if i feel like something different 😁"
Recovery,how did you stop weighing yourself and counting calories?  i’m currently at mexico and not being able to weight myself is the worst thing and bothering me. i just now realized how my ed will always try and ruin anything i get to experience. i saw this scale at the bus station and tried using it and it ended up just stealing my 5 pesos. i saw this as a sign from god to just enjoy the donut and just try and take a day off from trying to count calories. it was also a sign to just give into my extreme hunger for the day without needing to loose a certain weight first.  anyways dominos or subway or both and if so what should i get.
Recovery,"My eating disorder ruined „my“ whole life (body, family, friends, apprenticeship, salary, school, myself) and people are letting me know that  I feel like a narcissist because everything turns around me since a year (not since my Ed started). My father yelled at me today and got aggressive as he was to my mother when I was a little child and said “you you you always you”. I feel like I shouldn’t be overacting like that and just accept the edema and everything. My swelling is not valid. It is okay to say my legs are fat. It is okay to say that I am walking like I shitted in my pants. But it is not okay to do something against the edema. My father will send me to psych ward on Thursday but he said it like I would go into a childrens home. He wants to send the problems away but when I will come back all the edema will be worse and everything will be worse. No one understands it and I am overacting. My eating disorder is valid but my edema and pain and stiffness is not. I wish I was just anorexic and scared of weight gain and food. But instead I developed the most embarrassing consequences (extreme ass swelling, only gaining fluid, tree trunk legs, stiffness, fibrosis, burning, arguing with doctors, showing pictures of my naked ass to doctors to get taken seriously-> wasn’t taken seriously , and so one, not being able to breath at night due to anasarca in hot Italy)
What the hell can eds do? I wish I had the standard Ed with arguing about food with my father. But instead I have the ed with arguing with my doctor if I have edema or not and not believing me and getting called fat. I once argued with a doctor because no one did stemmers sign even though it is positive and it is the only way for me to prove it. I would be able to gain weight on my own because I did it so many times but since a year I can only gain painful fluid and the body fat never came back. I am waiting for the body fat to come back like a child waiting for Christmas but it never came back not even after gaining 15kg and months of waiting with pain and accepting the swelling. Sorry that this post turned around me again."
Recovery,"almost 2 yrs recovered with no appetite = triggering?? (F27)  i hope someone can relate to this and maybe have advice for me without judgement 💜

i started recovering from my ED (AN w/ purging) in November of 2020. I had been maintaining a low weight for my height for about 2 years after losing 80 lbs in less than a year (started keto, got addicted to exercise, started purging bc the anxiety of feeling pressured to break ketosis, morphed into extended fasting and low restriction up until almost a year after I graduated college). I haven’t purged since January of 2021 OR intentionally restricted. I’m overweight now and I’m okay with it, I would rather be OW than UW with health problems. I gained weight SO FAST at the beginning but the extreme hunger went away after about 6 months. 

the past year I’ve lost my appetite almost completely - I don’t crave anything anymore, I have a hard time enjoying food unless I’m with my fiancé. It feels like such a chore and I feel guilty as fuck for only eating once or twice a day if I’m not with my partner. I know doing OMAD can be healthy if you’re overweight, but mentally I feel like I’m flirting with a relapse. My ED behavior landed me it’s severe GERD after recovering and I can’t eat unless I take my meds an hour before. so many times I forget to take my meds and just say fuck it and give up on food because I don’t wanna risk having stomach pain and acid reflux. Without weed, eating feels impossible some days. 

here’s where it gets fun lol 😭 I actually prefer the way I look as a plus sized person and as a sex worker, my looks directly affect my income. A big draw for my subscribers is that I’m “bbw” (big beautiful woman lmaooo) but I’m having such a hard time keeping weight on. My fiancé is super into the way I look right now, and I’ve gained about 100 pounds since we first started dating. They reassured me that they are hella attracted to a wide range of bodies and that they’ll always be attracted to me even if I lose all the weight I gained. 

I’m scared if I start losing again I could relapse - I recovered before I met my fiancé and I don’t want them to ever see me sick like i was before. I do eventually wanna lose weight to have a healthy pregnancy after we get married  (maybe get down to high end of normal) but I have no idea how to go about it. I feel triggered whenever I see I’m losing weight and it makes me worry for when it’s time for me to slim down on purpose."
Recovery,"I can’t deal with the weight gain  I know I know I know gaining weight is a part of recovery but oh my gosh today I had an appointment and they told me I had a weigh in day soon. The clinic is kinda far so they said how about you start weighing yourself at home from now on, but my mum said the one we have at home might not be accurate so we went to use a scale at a gym. That scale told me my weight height BMI AND body fat percentage - all the gorey details, and my mum let me see it. I wanted to break down so so bad right then right there at how much weight I've gained and I'm trying so hard to fight a relapse rn but I just can't do this. And she wants to take me school clothes shopping soon I'm so terrified to not fit in the clothes by the time school starts again because of the rate at which I’m gaining weight. I wondered if I could just lose the extra little bit of weight I gained before it got too much by restricting just for a couple of weeks but obviously that’s not possible. I can't stop crying right now and my body image has been awful lately on top of that. Nothing looks good on me anymore. I can't even talk to my mum about this because she gets all worried and worked up instead of trying to help or offering advice. Help:/"
Recovery,"Some questions about all in recovery ?  Hi, I have been attempting all in recovery-for real this time- for about 5 days now. So the first time I tried recovering, I had more extreme hunger and cravings, and was actually enjoying some of the foods I ate. I got to a place where I wasn’t afraid of a lot of things, I had a variety of foods and could eat out, but never stopped movement fully. I started exercise too soon and it progressed into heavier restriction to the point where movement was even difficult. I am really trying to commit fully this time, but am so confused because my hunger feels much less, like I am truly force feeding myself, yet Im being told my mental hunger needs to be honored. I keep thinking it must be because i have let myself have these foods before, and my heavier restriction didn’t last that long, so extreme hunger just isn’t necessary for my body to feel? I am really sorry if this is a tiresome post but it is extremely difficult for me to understand the necessity of eating more when my ED seems to be so different from others; sorry again"
Recovery,"Hot cocoa and progress  I'm the kind of guy who eats ""healthy"" during the week, and in the weekends I eat stuff like chocolate, candy, ice cream etc. simply because I prefer this eating-pattern, ED or not.

However; I've started to allow myself to drink hot cocoa during weekdays as a little snack, and it is really good to be honest! It's not something ""big"" like a whole bar of chocolate or pint of ice cream, but it's still some good old fashioned sugar (which is a step up from when my ED was at its worst, because then I couldn't even enjoy added sugar during weekends!).

It's funny how a single cup of cocoa can remind me how far I've come. I'm still terrified each and every day, but at least now I'm terrified with a warm, sweet beverage in my hands."
Recovery,"Making others aware of what is helpful or harmful to say to someone with an ED  Hello there, so I’ve recently opened up to a couple of friends and my mum about my relapse and they’ve all been great at listening and being supportive. 

One thing though is that sometimes people will say things, and while I know that they mean no harm my ED brain will run with it and skew it. 

I am pretty aware of fatphobia, my own internalised weight bias and how diet culture, the thin ideal and orthorexic tendancies are just “normal” for a lot of people, so maybe I’m overly sensitive. But I’ve been thinking about putting a little list together for my mum and maybe 1-2 friends of how seemingly innocent comments can just stick in my brain. 

Some examples: 
Being invited to dinner/ a party: Don’t worry, you don’t have to eat anything —> others expect me not to eat 

Don’t worry you won’t become fat/overweight—> If I do gain and become overweight, that would be bad 

Or (when I told my mum that I was so hungry today and bought a cheese croissant on the go for which I felt massively guilty) Why did you get that crap when you could have gotten two bananas? —> I’m only allowed “healthy” food. 

Do you guys think that’s a good idea?"
Recovery,"Day 2 of going all in  Someone left a comment saying they're interested in my journey, so i might make this a daily thing :) It helps me sort out my thoughts as well.

&#x200B;

So, today I woke up extremely bloated and hungry again. I had a huge bowl of cereal for breakfast, as well as some blueberries and a banana. But I was still hungry, at least mentally. So I ended up having my lunch, which consisted of a sandwich with cucumber, cream cheese and tomato + some cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers on the side, as well. Now here is where I made some progress:

Before going all in, I would have thought ""well, I already ate the lunch I made for work, so i won't poack anything else."" but today I stopped by a nearby bakery to get a bread roll before I got to work. I ate at lunch. And here comes another win: I had two cookies with my coffee at lunch. My coworkers keep bringing food to work (I know they're doing it for me) and I'm always tempted to have some, but never accept it. But I mustered up the courage to have those cookies :) After what ended up being an 11 hour shift, I got home and had dinner, which was BBQ again. I had chicken breast with cucumber salad and some baguette. It was a prepackaged cucumber salad and those kinds of salads used to be a big fear, but I'm slowly getting comfortable with them. We still have lots of baguette left, so I snacked on some while preparing my lunch for tomorrow. And I was craving ice cream, so i had some as well. Another win :) It was one of those ice cream sandwiches that are half waffle, half covered in chocolate. It used to be my favorite, but I started to fear it because of the calories. Today was my second time challenging it. I had been making compromises by having lower calorie ice creams, but not anymore. 

My bloating is still very intense and today I'm having a negative body image. I'm trying to figure out whether I had enough today or if I should eat something else. I'm satisfied for now. When I got something extra for lunch, I was fighting with myself. Thinking that I'm eating too much today. But having written all of it down, it doesn't sound like a lot. Hmm...

&#x200B;

Tomorrow I'll have work, then a break and then school (I'm a dentist's assistant in training and here in Germany you get training by work place experience and by going to a school specifically accustomed to your field of work). I have a long break to have enough time to get to school. I'm thinking about stopping by at a cafe to get some pastry or cake. To celebrate going all in. I hope I can muster up the courage. It'll be the first day after summer break and I'm starting my second year now. I'm a bit disappointed that I haven't made much progress over the past 6 weeks... But it can only go up from here!

That's it for today :)"
Recovery,"How to stop the constant body checking/weighing  Literally driving myself insane. I have been body checking for copious years. Many, many times throughout the day. I didn’t even know what it was until about a year or so ago. I just thought I was insane, lol. Wrapping my fingers around my wrist, touching my collarbone, sternum, spine, arms, etc. I even body check while conversing with people/out in public. I am autistic, so I think it has become a sort of stimming behavior for me. Even when I avoid mirrors, I do this. Constantly. And if my upper arm feels even slightly bigger than it did the day before, it’s enough to ruin my whole ass day and I’m so tired of it. I feel like winter is easier because I can just hide in big cozy sweaters. But I can’t seem to stop with the body checking or constantly weighing myself. It makes recovery progress so much harder because feeling things get even a tiny bit bigger is enough to trigger me back into restriction and compensatory habits."
Recovery,"I have apparently never honored purely mental hunger and I don't know how to do it.  My hunger cues went away a little over a month ago when I got Covid. Y'all had [helpful advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/w8uapy/struggling_to_get_back_on_track_after_covid/) about that which aligned with my RD's recommendation to go back to doing mechanical eating for a while until I'm used to eating throughout the day again. 

I met with my RD again to talk through this more, because I'm really struggling with feeling like I have permission to eat when I don't feel physical hunger in my stomach. When I was experiencing extreme hunger, I basically treated that as my permission to eat, and then when I got sick and my hunger cues faded, so did my permission. 

And as we talked about other ways your body sends hunger signals besides your stomach rumbling, it kind of forced me to realize and admit that I have completely refused to honor mental hunger throughout my entire recovery process. If I have a thought about food or a craving to taste something, I have thus far been ignoring it unless/until it lined up with feeling hunger in my stomach. 

I just don't understand how to go about this. I've always interpreted thoughts about food or taste cravings to be an emotional trigger, like that it's what you experience if you use food to cope with your feelings. But my RD says that's not true, and that those are signals that I need to eat. 

I just don't know how to feel okay with honoring cravings for something calorie-dense like a milkshake when I'm not feeling physically hungry. Last night I made one to try to honor it but I stopped after 2-3 sips because it just felt wrong to have it when I didn't feel like I was starving. It probably doesn't help that after wanting so many milkshakes throughout my extreme hunger period that I basically interpret a craving for them as ""your body is telling you to gain weight"" which is really upsetting. 

I was back at my pre-ED weight right before I got Covid, and then between that and the relapsing I've been struggling with ever since, my weight's been going back down and I've been interpreting it as my body telling me I could be done now and didn't need to weigh so much anymore. My RD says that's probably not true, but that I don't necessarily have to weight restore again if I can get back on track with eating enough and my weight stays the same.

I realize I'm doing a combination of overthinking, self-shaming, restricting, and using the size of my body to determine the valid criteria I have to meet in order to eat. I just don't know how to overcome this, or to believe even that it's something I do need to overcome."
Recovery,"Knowing my weight  Kind of a follow on from my last post, but I spoke to my therapist about the anxiety of getting weighed, and she told me it’s better that I know my weight so I can ‘challenge the thoughts that I’ve gained loads of weight’. I genuinely don’t know what to think of this, part of me just doesn’t want to know my weight because it just takes away the whole stress of it, but also seeing that my weight hadn’t gone up by a huge amount today kind of reassured me to carry on in recovery, even though the relapse thoughts were really strong."
Recovery,"i think we can eat a lot more at our setpoint than we think ngl  TW- UNCENSORED CALORIE NUMBERS (i literally dont know how to censor them someone help 😭) 

okay so anyway this is just sm j was thinking about so I played around with a few numbers bc this is an unstructured rant but anywy i feel like humans can eat a lot more than we think while we're at our setpoint. 

it's just something that pops up in my mind whenever i hear someone say ""oh yeah, my maintenance is 2300! anything more and i'll gain."" it always seems so impossible to me that its that low? One day I calculated the calories of an average day pre-ed, and it was definitely at LEAST 3500 - 4000 a day. And guess what? My weight was stable (aka, stable for a growing child. ) even though I was growing,i am a girl and only lightly active, meaning I should've likely been eating less than that. using a couple TDEE calculators (which i wont even get started on which circle of inaccuracy hell they crawled out of,) my range shouldve been 1500 - 1650 per day based on a lightly active girl of 11yr old me's height and weight. at the 'professional athlete' exercise level they still said i shouldve been eating 2100-2400. if we take my 'lightly active' TDEE calculator average, i would need 1600 a day. even adding one THOUSAND calories to that bc the calculators are shit and never to be trusted, i was still overeating by 1000-1500 EVERY DAY. As someone who had (and still has) a massive sweet tooth, to anybody who this matters to (even during my Ana, macros never particularly bothered me) those were calories quite largely dedicated to carbs and fats. 
And guess what! I was at my set point range, so my body could handle perfectly well what I ate. My set point is considered healthy on the BMI scale, so to anyone who that matters to, I was exactly at the recommended weight for my height and age. However, my weight happening to naturally fall into a ""healthy"" BMI (which disclaimer should not be used as an accurate measurement, it is a dated system used by doctors because it is cheap and effortless, regardless of the fact it does mot provide an accurate reflection of health) range is almost entirely due to genetics, and im only mentioning it before someone comes along like nyeh i wont listen to you bc youre ""obese"" and you eat too much!! 

this isnt just me though. what sparked this post is seeing my favourite ed recovery tiktoker (@_thewellnessdiaries, i love her sm) make a video about how now that shes fully weight restored, shes noticed she can eat loads, and her body knows how to deal with it. she mentioned how the last few days she'd had a couple meals, that thanks to menu calories she knows were over 2000 calories. On top of her regular 3 meals 3 snacks. And her weight hadn't changed! 


anyway forgive typing errors bc i gtg and dont have time to edit, tldr i think you can eat a lot more at your setpoint weight than you think."

Something I have always REALLY struggled with is allowing myself to buy the foods my EH is asking for. Those fear foods - ones I’ve been restricting for years. I can’t fathom the thought of actually buying like a box of my favourite cereal for myself. I could spend money on others, but not myself.

i’ve struggled with an eating disorder for over a year now, and I was diagnosed with anorexia 5 months ago. I was recently in Paris, where for a month I guess I just let myself go and ate what I wanted. I told myself that I wouldn’t restrict myself and that all the walking would make it okay. I gained around 10 lbs. I got home, feeling fine, and excited for the rest of the summer. I spent a weekend with family where I ate A LOT. I feel very guilty about it. I weighed myself today and I am 4 lbs heavier. So here I am, so anxious and scared over the possibility that I got that much heavier in one weekend. I feel scared and unsafe. I feel like i’m in some sort of danger. I don’t fit into some of my clothes anymore, and it’s making me want to relapse. my thoughts won’t stop and it is genuinely torturous. I don’t want to ruin august for myself by worrying about food and I also don’t want to hate the way I look and feel awful. but at this point it’s too late. I wish I could be happy again. I got myself into such a mess developing this disorder that im so afraid i’ll never see the light at the end of the tunnel. I want to be comfortable with myself but the little girl who didn’t care about her large thighs is long gone. i’ve been overeating these past few days and I just feel like i’ve gained more weight than I should’ve.

It seem like the bloating will never stop and I can't fit in my pants anymore because of weight gain and it's worst because my belly is hudge from the bloat 🥲. I was wondering for those who have recovered, how long did it take for the bloating to stop?"
Recovery,"Something that bothers me  Hi so I am in recovery and obviously we all know the importance of fueling your body making sure you eat your breakfast lunch dinner and snacks as well. My boyfriend knows im in recovery and knows my struggles what really bothers me is that he often skips breakfast or any other meals, and says ''i wasnt hungry''. its just so unhealthy and its bothering me what should I do?"
Recovery,"Weight comments  Oh my God I feel like I'm losing my mind. I really need some advice on how to deal with this

Basically right now people commenting on my weight is one of my biggest fears, I literally get anxious thinking about meeting people I know because I am so scared they will tell me I have gained weight. My grandma always comments on my weight and it makes me SO angry because every time I tell her to stop, she does it so casually and out of NOWHERE, and I react in an unnaturally angry way. And she acts like she did nothing wrong, just an ""oops we are human we all slip sometimes"" and it makes me even more angry. I honestly just want to either last out on whoever comments on my weight or hurt myself in a violent way. I know this is not normal in any shape or form but there isn't really anything I can do about it. I just get angry at the idea of being perceived with weight, I don't know how to explain it. Please help because I know the weight comments will not stop as I recover further."
Recovery,"New orthorexia fears  Recently I've been doing a harmful amount of reading about PFAs and heavy metals being present in our food and water, and it's kind of destroyed me. I feel like absolutely no food is safe at all. Everything is highly processed and filled with chemicals, microplastics, dyes, or contaminated with pesticides and herbicides, or even if it's organic produce, it still contains PFAs which are apparently present in all rainwater around the globe. Rice sucks arsenic up out of soil. My local tapwater also contains high levels of arsenic. 

I have this horrible anxiety and nausea constantly. I've convinced myself that I can *feel* the carcinogens and poisons building up in my body no matter what I do. They're fucking up my cellular processes and making me sick over time. I'm probably going to die of cancer in my 40s or 50s and I don't think there's anything at all that I can do to avoid it.

So yeah. I'm obviously still eating so I don't die. but I fucking hate what we've done to ourselves and the planet and I want to cry constantly."
Recovery,"How to deal with not feeling valid/sick enough? TW  I’m supposed to be getting better but I feel like I need to get smaller for it to have counted. My therapist has diagnosed me with anorexia, but my PCP has me as having EDNOS (or the new term for it). I feel like that means I’m not thin enough to *need* to stop yet, or to be able to stop. I feel like if I stop now it was all for nothing and wasn’t actually anorexia at all and was just a failed diet. TW talk of bmi and weight- >!I’ve lost literally half of my body weight and I’m now at a BMI of 18.5 and I feel like I need to lose a bit more and get *officially* underweight because clearly my PCP doesn’t think I’m sick enough!< I know this is probably not the most logical thought I’ve ever had but I’ve felt extremely invalidated and triggered ever since I read the dr’s summary where it says “eating disorder, unspecified” and I don’t know how to move on. I’m supposed to start PHP at the end of this week but I feel like such a fraud now."
Recovery,"Dealing w/shaming  I moved from the west coast to the middle of the country, and the amount of appearance related bullying I've been dealing with went up by a LOT. Smaller bodies are very uncommon here, but they were very common in my home state. Nutrition knowledge and wellness culture is also less popular, and I think that is strongly related. 

I am recovered. I am. I don't relate much to the younger me who would starve, count every single calorie, compare my body to everyone else's, etc. I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum kinda now-- I'm trying to gain muscle mass and increase endurance so I can be a hiking, sparring, rock-climbing MACHINE. I truly believe I'm doing okay with food, and no doctors have been upset with my weight in a few years. 

BUT...The bullying is getting to me and making me feel like I need to relapse to be liked. I started at a new job and was so excited about my coworkers and jazzed to make some new friends. But they kept asking ""What size do you wear? Like, what size pants? Really?!Oh....No reason . :)"" and ""Do you even put sugar in your coffee? Oh, you like caramel? lol its probably the sugar free"" and ""I could throw you across the room. "" and I tried to address it with my manager, but she was the main commenter and she just said ""Pfft. Well, you ARE skinny."" I opened up to her about having an ED and that the comments make it harder, and she just went ""Ok, so? So do I. A lot of people do. "" I explained that I understand that and that's why I don't comment on food people eat or their bodies ever, and I would really like if I could get the same...especially at work. It never stopped and eventually I was fired for repeatedly pulling my manager to the back to tell her ""No, you can't talk to me like this"". 

I am so confused. I don't understand why they were so mean to me and insisted to me that I'm a skeleton. I have body dysmorphia, so I can't just look in a mirror and know they're wrong. I've had to check myself with 3 doctors, every friend I have, a few internet strangers, and I'm still paranoid that I secretly look like a paperclip and nobody will tell me. My sources suggested my presence exacerbates an insecurity that they have, and that's where the cruelty is coming from. Or it's that they're so unused to seeing athletic bodies that their perception is skewed. But that's hard to believe. Is anyone else experiencing this or have any perspective to share?"
Recovery,"Day 1 of going all in  I woke up really bloated. Had a huge breakfast, was even more bloated. But being at work for 10 hours distracted me. Work makes me happy. I fueled myself properly for lunch. And damn, it feels amazing to be full and satisfied. Not the ""I'm so stuffed"" kind of full. But the fullness you get after eating properly.
I had dinner right after I got home from work. It was a BBQ, which we've been having at least once a week. I'm very bloated again. And I looked into the mirror and felt curvier (my clothes also played a huge part).. and I liked it? I felt womanly. If recovery turns me into a woman, then I'm looking forward to it. I'm turning 21 this year. And I feel like I regressed due to my ED.

But not anymore. Now I'll progress. I'm weirdly happy today. Might be the workaholic in me. Or me properly fueling myself.

I'm craving ice cream right now, but we don't have any. There's an amazing ice café about a 20min bike drive away and they close in 45 minutes... I'm thinking about going there to get some ice cream 👉👈 

Anyways, this is your sign to get a snack. The one you're craving at the moment. Even if your ED is telling you no. Especially then. Because fuck EDs."
Recovery,"Eating the whole pack of cookies ant still restricting  I realize I was doing a micro-restricton. I'm ALL IN, and that means giving me the freedom to eat a packet of cookies, or chocolate, of chips if I want to. But still eating a packet of something and knowing its grams makes me feel safe, or rather, it makes my ED feel safe. "" OH yeah, i am eating 100 grams of this, or 90 grams of x""
I want to remind you that there may also be restrictions, even if you feel like you eat a lot.

What I did to get out of this restriction was to put all the cookies in the same box and throw away the packaging. That way, I can eat as much as I want, and with more variety! For me its a win or win situation"
Recovery,"Conflicted  Yesterday I saw a picture of myself and for the first time thought that I looked too thin. I didn’t realize that I looked like that because I don’t see myself that way when I look down at my body or look in the mirror. I realize now that I need to gain weight, I don’t like how I look, but I’m very afraid of doing so. I am sick of living this way and I want to recover, but recovery scares the shit out of me. I’ve been in quasi for the past two-ish months, having much more “cheat days” and mostly doing high restriction but I’ve still been loosing slowly because I “save up” calories if I know I’m going to have a non calorie counting/binge day. To make things more complicated, two days ago I overate and binge drank so right now I’m in the mode of needing to “fix it”, while also dealing with the realization that I need to gain weight. I start therapy next week, and right now I really don’t know what to do or how much I should eat and I feel guilty, ashamed, stressed out and embarrassed. My great grandmother cried and said a prayer over me when she saw me for fucks sake. I can’t believe I let this get so out of hand when all I wanted to do was loose a little bit of weight a year ago. Now my life revolves around food, everyone is worried about me, and I feel constantly miserable, mentally hungry, and uncomfortable in my body. I just want this to stop, I want my life back, I want to be normal, but the thought of giving up control scares me so much."

Ofc after the festival we were bloody tired and hungry so i let my self to eat freely, without checking cals or Search for ""healthy"" options. But i ate a ton of foods like french fries, biscuits and so on. Now I'm here scared of possible nonsense weight gain -really nonsense-. Past week I increase my intake bc of this festival due my past with passing out. I really didn't want to embarrass my self with such thing so i ate. 
Now I'm feeling so disgusting and uncomfortable. Go back restricting isn't an option anymore, I'm more scared of going on a b/r cycle than gain weight. But i really don't know how to cope now"
Recovery,"how to cope with feeling like everyday has to be consistent  idk if this makes sense or if any ody else feels this but I don't know how to deal with the fact that everyday won't be the same and I don't I have to live up to it I guess

I mean this in both ways basically let's say I have a low appetite one day and don't eat that much I feel like the next day has to be the same and for the rest of my life otherwise I am a failure

it also works the other way around basically if I ate more than usual because maybe I was more active or just hungrier or the food was just good I feel like suddenly everyday I'm going to eat like that

I also feel like this is inducing my night eating (where I just wake up in the middle of the night and eat like a whole meal but it is getting better)

ive been in recovery for like a year now and I'm weight restored and stuff but this stuff is still really challenging, it feels like constant compensation which is a whole nother problem

Recovery,"How to cope with cellulite/rolls?  I’ve been trying to wear comfortable clothes, but literally none of my shorts fit, even the ones that did last week. I’ve been wearing the same pair with a stretchy waistband for a few days and it’s been digging into my stomach, too. When I sit down, I’m painfully aware of my rolls protruding over the top, and I can see the cellulite that I’ve never had before in my life even pre-ED. I can’t wear clothes that hide my body because it’s too hot and the AC is broken. I’m continuing to honor my hunger at all times and abstain from all movement, but I’m feeling really uncomfy with the changes in my body. What’s the best way to cope that’s not an avoidance tactic?"
Recovery,"I’m hungry and it’s making me soo anxious  I’ve been “high restricting” again for a few months now with only 2-3 days not in line with my calorie limit so I know it makes sense that I’m hungry but I’m so scared of this feeling. I’ve eaten something (mor than I usually do up to lunch time) and it’s still here and I’m at work and anxious and just want to throw a tantrum. 

I’ve been toying with the idea of having a “refeeding” day just to calm my body and nerves. But it feels wrong doing so without anyone else with me to justify it. On the other hand all the past days I’ve spent with others I’ve been able to stay under my limit. 

When my ED first came around (disguised as fit and healthy lifestyle ofc) I used to have these “diet breaks” every two weeks or so relatively guilt free. But now it’s so daunting :( but I feel like maybe it’s a step I should take as in harm reduction?! 

It’s driving me insane today I feel like a black hole"

Recovery,"Comments from other people  I don't like just ranting about this sort of thing, however, it's really been bugging me and I need to get it off my chest. It's funny how for years I loved if people were to comment on my thinness and such, however, now it couldn't be further from true. I got lucky in some regard that my major weight loss occurred during the colder months so it was easy enough to go unnoticed. Yet now as its heating up ever so slightly people are noticing and commenting on my low weight and as somebody trying to recover it just really irks me. I understand that in a diet obsessed world it's intended as a compliment, and I know that it's true as well but god damn does it just get to me."

Disordered,"Those with SE-AN  At what point did you realise, no matter what treatment, you'll always be plagued by this disorder and decided to work on harm reduction (or the other courses of action)?
Todays my (8th?) year of AN. Previous to this was BED for 10+ years. Learning I will always hold onto one. I'm 28 now, and so far no treatments done true benefit. I don't think 8 years classes as SE-AN, but I went too long untreated (never for BED) and 7 years with AN. And I feel like at this point, I have to either accept I'll always be stuck with AN, and to work on just trying to live a functional life the best I can rather then recover, or to give in to it fully."
Disordered,"Cant continue all-in, but I don’t want to relapse  Today is the worst EH day i’ve had in months and i’m sorry but i can’t just keep eating, I just can’t. I don’t want to relapse but going all-in had had the worst affect on me mentally this past year and I’m just stuck and don’t really know what to do. I’ve been in and out of the emergency room like 5 times, had to stay a week at the psych ward, and this past week I’ve been having hour long panic attacks every single day (like sitting on the floor not being able to breathe, chest pain, the whole 9 yards). I can’t keep doing this because I will end up doing something to myself, or fall into a full forced relapse.

I try to eat, but every time I do, no matter what I eat, I feel like shit. My stomach hurts, I get acid reflux, I’m nauseous (and I already deal with functional nausea and emetophobia so that’s cool). I know it’s gonna take baby steps and recovery takes forever but I just don’t see a point. I’m so miserable now, no matter what I do, that I’m just at my breaking point.

Anyone else go through this in recovery? Any tips or tricks?"
Disordered,"My 67-year-old mother has untreated disordered eating and it is really fucking with our relationship  I was diagnosed with having disordered eating issues and body dysmorphia in the process of going back to therapy a couple years ago. It's so obvious now looking back, but I never realized that my sisters' severe anorexia and my seriously disordered eating habits stemmed so greatly from my mothers' own issues. 

This is a tale as old as time for mothers and daughters, I'm sure. 

At this point, I'd say I'm in a state of recovery. My relationship with my self-image is becoming more positive and I'm far less distressed and preoccupied by weight and food. 

My mother came to visit me a month ago and her disordered eating issues were extremely distressing to me. To some degree I have heightened awareness about her issues now, but I also believe they have worsened and I don't know how to deal with it. She's lost probably 30 pounds since I saw her for Christmas. 

Every moment of her five days with me revolved around food: if we weren't talking about near-future eating, we were talking about what she does or doesn't eat, the weight she's losing (""I lost two pounds after we came back from our vacation""), and how proud she is of the little she eats (""I realized I can eat half as many of the olives I like on my salad every day, I really don't need the calories""). 

It got so under my skin and was so triggering for me. It brought back so many feelings of resentment I experienced early in therapy when I was processing all the hurtful things my mom said to me growing up about my body, the fact that my disordered eating and self-harm cries for help went unnoticed by my parents because my sister had full-blown anorexia, how my binge eating in secret habit probably developed from being judged and shamed by my mom for eating, and how my obsession with diets is because of their presence on a pedestal in my home. 

I'm 28 and my parents aren't young. Our relationship was strained growing up and I want to improve my relationship with my parents so they don't die completely estranged from me. 

I know I can't be my mom's therapist but I don't know how I can tolerate being in a relationship with her because of how harmful and triggering her own issues are to me."

Recovery,"Said fuck off to the voices  Tw because some things are explained in detail

I've been having a really dark time recently, very depressed and stopped confiding in others, and the guilt has come back. I feel guilty for every bite I eat. Yesterday night I had a big breakdown and planned a relapse for today. Woke up late, ate a big pasta lunch (which I will talk about later lol it was so good), spent the afternoon with a small snack and had a croissant later in the day, and the calories total came around... Very little, which is ironic considering how high cal the foods I ate was. I wanted to be done with that because I also had an argument with my mom today and was in a very sour mood. But idk for what reason it felt like a switch was pressed in my brain and I got like, really angry at my brain, I got up and made a pb&j sandwich, texted my dad to get me some oats, yogurt and banana (comfort meal). Prior to that my mom asked what I'll eat for dinner, I lied and said I would decide even tho I didn't want to, but after my dad was back I made some yogurt-oat thing and ate it, later I got hungry again and ate more pb&j and a lot of watermelon afterwards. 

I honestly didn't mean for this to become like a food log journal but I don't know how else to explain it, I weirdly didn't feel guilty for anything I ate after the croissant (even tho my stomach wasn't happy with all that watermelon.. but I was!) So I guess I am happy for that. I am flying to Korea in a few days and I cannot afford to relapse, who will eat all the instant noodle flavors and tteokbokki there if I relapse :((

ETA I forgot to add the biggest win, I usually feel horrible for reaching for another store bought snack during the day if I already had one but like an hour ago I felt so hungry that I got a cake snack and ate it without feeling bad!"

Recovery,"Is this going to become an issue?  So I've basically been on the verge of developing anorexia for a good year and a half now, maybe more. I've tried talking to my psychiatrist about it, but she kind of won't listen. I've recently started making excuses for meals, almost as if it were habit but I've never really done this before. Like I started making excuses to eat less, or not eat at all, and sometimes I blurt it out before my brain even gets the time to process what I want to answer. And I get really near panic attacks when I feel full sometimes but not always. Sometimes I also kind of want to do some uhhh- not PG s/h stuff, so... I don't know how bad this could become because it's not like- bad rn, I just- I don't know. My mental health is actually crumbling and I need this to not become an issue..."

Disordered,"Worried that my sis may have an ED  I (25 F) have been noticing that my little sister (17 F) has been treating food... a little differently than usual, the past few months.

We usually eat three portions of food for lunch and dinner. However of late she's been eating only 2 half-sized portions. We usually eat together as a family, but she has been taking her food to her room/in front of the TV/eating after everyone's done or before we start our meals.

She doesn't avoid junk food, and has never mentioned calories. However whenever she does eat a snack she usually skips the next meal saying she's too full.

She never used to talk much about fatness or fat people, but lately she has been going on massive rants about them and how lazy and greedy they are. Like she genuinely feels SO ANGRY about them. She often also calls herself fat and makes a lot of self deprecating jokes about her weight even though she's very underweight.

She also started drinking a lot of coffee everyday. Its non-negotiable for her. And she told me enthusiastically that it helps with pooping better.

Disordered,"Weight restoration (TW: exercise mentioned)  I've been reading about the weight restoration process and I understand that to reach your set point weight, the body needs to restore its fat free mass.

Disordered,"are there physical consequences of quasi recovery?  so when i initially developed my ed i dieted down to about 15-20 pounds below my set point and by then i realized my mind was completely fucked up and i had no idea what to do so i sort of entered quasi recovery where i ate 1800-2200 cals bc that seemed to be what every girl on tiktok ate to maintain. but i was so anxious of going over that amount and basically never allowed myself to and constantly watched what i ate and it sucked. now that i’m at my set point i eat more like 3000 but it seems like most people eat around 2000 cals if not less anyways. so in terms of physical health i don’t really see what was wrong with me staying in quasi bc i ate “enough”. basically my ed has been giving me a hard time for not staying in quasi recovery. mentally it was hell bc i wasn’t making much progress with tackling the ed thoughts and i eventually relapsed harder into restriction as a result but what are the physical repercussions of staying in a slightly suppressed body weight? i wasn’t drastically below my set point, i was getting my period for a couple months, the only things that were really compromised were my digestion and heart rate and even then they weren’t terribly slow. i’m just wondering if it would actually be physically harmful for me to be slightly under my set point. i’m not defending quasi by any means bc i was miserable but i have a hard time taking myself seriously if i wasn’t actually harming my physical health. when i was in that stage i wanted for gain the weight back so i could have food freedom and stop being obsessed with food but it feels like a sad excuse to gain weight.."

I have such a thing about how my legs look as well so I compared photos of them today to pictures from before I started recovery and cried even more. 
I don't want to upset my mum and see her the way she was when I was sick. She cares so much and I feel horrible for what I put her through with this illness but I just can't. if this little weight gain can regress me so badly I'm clearly just not ready to recover. If I keep eating and shovelling food in my mouth regardless of the thoughts I know it's just gonna give them more volume and eventually fuel a relapse.
I just need support, I just want someone to tell me why it’s even worth it to recover. I cant believe my self hatred runs so deep that I put myself through this"
Disordered,"To eat or not to eat  I live alone currently and yesterday I said fuck it and drank way too much and didn’t count calories (stupid), but it also means that today I want to eat everythingggg. And now I’m just sitting here going “I’m gonna order food” “I’m not gonna order food” over and over and over because I know that I shouldn’t, but I want sushi soooo bad. I hate this internal argument so damn much 😫 

I guess I might be looking for permission? I really have no idea. Being alone and like… allowing myself to eat is so hard 🙃"
Disordered,"Having a life with EH  How do you guys can have a normal life with EH? Like I didn't do much those past 2 weeks. I had summer break and could focus completely on eating and healing. But now I have to start learning for my exams and I don't know how to handle studying and EH at once. I try not to stress myself but somehow my extreme hunger got huge in the past days so all I can focus on while studying is food even when I have just eaten or have food constantly right next to me while learning. It feels like there isn't any space in my head except for sleeping and food. But it's just like that when I'm learning. Practicing hobbies or short social events are fine.
Did you experience it as well?
How do you cope with that?"
Recovery,"Already excited for holidays, huge win in my recovery?  I feel a bit stupid for being so excited for the holidays, since we're still in the middle of summer, but I see this as good progress in my recovery :)

Like, I'm looking forward to Halloween and autumn, I want to bake pumpkin pie and throw a Halloween sleepover with my friends. Then, for christmas season, I want to bake cookies once a week, I want to be excited every time I open another door of my advent calender. Then comes my birthday, on the 21st. My 21st birthday. It's my lucky birthday, right? I haven't properly celebrated my birthday in forever. And my 20th birthday was one of the most depressing days in my life. I didn't let myself enjoy it at all. So this year, I want to spoil myself. I'll bake a huge cake for myself and I will have a huge slice of it :) It'll be the cake younger me dreamed of. 

Christmas celebrations will follow soon after and I won't skim out on Christmas dinner with my family. 

And for New Year's Eve, I'll celebrate my choice to go into recovery. My choice to keep living.

&#x200B;

What does scare me a bit is that I might have unrealistic expectations. What if it won't be as nice as I'm imagining? No one else around me makes a big deal out of holidays. And for my last birthday, it felt like everyone forgot. No one cared. Is it too selfish of me to expect a big celebration? I felt so insignificant that day. And I'm scared that this year won't be any different. But if i told my family and friends what I expect from my birthday celebrations, it would come off as demanding.

All those recovery influencers have amazing birthday celebrations. I guess I'm jealous... I want to have something nice for once. A day dedicated to myself. I'm starting to think, that maybe I too am deserving of having a nice day. First step to self love maybe?

I've been dropping some hints on what kind of presents I'd want to receive. Nothing specific. I just want to feel like someone thought of me for once. Last year, my friends gifted me a gift card and a huge bar of chocolate that I was too scared to eat because of my ED. It felt like they didn't even try. And then I felt horrible about myself for thinking that way. What if this year won't be any different?

It'll be a huge setback for me. It'll just reinforce the idea that I'm not important, that I'm not special and that everyone would be better off without me. But I don't want to think of that right now. I'll make the best of it."
Recovery,Timbits Birthday Cake Cereal  Is really fucking good.
Recovery,"Thoughts on having protein in every meal...  What are y’all’s thoughts on “having protein in every meal”. This is an Ed thought for me Bc it’s funny that I needed some sort of protein or else I freak out while I was deep in my Ed. Makes me feel so invalid when ppl comment on things like wow you eat so balance. Like no ma’am, it’s a rule for me and it’s a form of restriction. 
Also cue abbey sharps hunger crushing combo it’s seriously so annoying"
Recovery,are my period cravings normal ?????  i just got my period back for the first time in 6 months but these past 3 days i’ve been giving into my uterus’ cravings & eating lots of desserts/junk food which are high in sugar and i’m starting to feel bad about it. Is it okay to eat high amounts of sweets during this time of the month?? will it effect my health??? Usually i tend to avoid sugar bc of the fear of getting health problems later on. I feel like i’m overreacting a bit;; but i just wanted to know if anyone else is having these intense cravings and can’t control it-?? it’s so annoying lol
Recovery,"finally in control of my thoughts again (BED)  i got back on my anti-depressants after avoiding them bc of feared weight gain (which is bullshit) and I feel *so* much better. 

my hunger cues have been increasingly clearer and outside of being super hungry, the desire to binge eat has vanished. im so, so relieved. things are finally starting to look okay again. I had a pack of crackers with dinner tonight and i literally ate half of it and put it away. if i had even OPENED a pack of crackers two months ago it would send me into a horrible binge. better yet yall? i finished the pack like an hour later when I got hungry again. ik it’s small but I am so fucking happy over it."
Recovery,"Feeling free from my ed  I reached weight restoration and have been holding steady for a while. One of the first posts on the subreddit, I was still in the early stages of recovery and scared. I remembered when I made that post that I was sobbing about my extreme hunger and absolutely fucking terrified of gaining. Yet I wanted to get better and damn, I got a lot better.  


I never thought I'd get this far in recovery. I went out and had bread, fries, and pie in one day and didn't panic or cry about it. I thought I'd be stuck in this bullshit til I dropped dead and I'm absolutely proud. Even when I had to man up and ditch my sick clothes, or when I dealt with extreme hunger four days straight and eating exclusively peanut butter, yogurt, bagels, and pizza. I didn't realize how far I came til now and how I was able to enjoy eating out. 

Honestly, I have been dealing with disordered eating, before anorexia got my ass. I wanted to lose weight at 15, so I started, you know, up chucking spiraled into exclusive restriction. By 18, I was sick, underweight, and controlled by anorexia. I almost died last year. Became so underweight, with an irregular heartbeat, I could barely walk. I tried to eat, experienced extreme hunger, and then developed anorexia, b/p edition. Ruined my life to the point that I had to move back with parents and again, ceased nutritional intake. At that point, I was told I either needed to go all in, or I was going to get hospitalized and tubed.   


No one ever tells you that recovery is hard. They always make it look easy. The media is bullshit, is the first thing I learned. ED recovery ""influencers"" tend to be liars, probably also restrict, and I advise all new recoverers to avoid social media entirely during their recovery. I relapsed a few times, but never long term and while I still have bad days, I'm doing better. I think about the life I missed out on. I didn't get to spend my last thanksgiving with my parents or my older brother before he moved because I was hyperfocused on the food. I stopped drawing for so long because of my shitty ed, that nearly killed me, and made me hate myself for years on end.  


Three years ago, if you would've told me that I would be able to eat pie, make smoothies whenever I felt like it, and eat peanut butter out of the jar (yes, I now love peanut butter. I've changed my mind. It's good shit.) I'd cry or think you're full of it. I feel so proud of myself. My anorexia likes to chime in and tell me that I was better off with it, that I'm awful, etc. but I know that it was never worth dying. To cry over going out. Life is too fucking short to measure your coffee creamer, or to not eat bread when out with your dad on his 68th birthday, to not have that pizza with your friends. 

You will be happier. I promise. I have never felt so free and happy about life."
Recovery,"Seriously wtf I hate being constantly hungry.  This is a rant. I just started recovery about 1-2 weeks ago after having a seizure, and I’m sick and tired of fucking constantly being hungry. Like literally im never full, I get bloated and my stomach makes weird noises but I’ll still be hungry. Doesn’t matter how much food or water I drink I’ll still be hungry. I eat my three meals a day, drink, take my medication (which is just one potassium pill), I just don’t understand why I’m still hungry after eating. Just STOP IT."
Recovery,"recently spent a couple hundred dollars on apple watch (to toxically track my calories) and then decided to fully recover right after  It took 4 months of me being stuck in the worst quasi recovery to *finally* be able to shift my mindset and learn to lean into my recovery 110%. I was struggling with the extreme hunger and weight gain so much so I kept trying to relapse and restrict, but a couple days ago I had a life saving epiphany and told myself I wasn’t going to continue to starve and live like this anymore. Yeah, I could’ve definitely put that apple watch money towards something else (like food lol) so that sucks, but I am really proud of myself and am really really really grateful that I’m finally allowing myself to eat with zero restrictions. I’m letting go of my fear of the unknown and letting go of my fear of weight gain and I’m learning to respect my body and provide it with everything it needs to feel good again"
Recovery,"Truly Fuck eating disorders...Can I not just have fun and enjoy myself without having to constantly fret and have calories and weight on my mind?  I’m getting ready to go out to meet friends for dinner and drinks at a pub/pizzeria that has delicious food and tons of awesome beer. After that we are going to a concert that I’ve been looking forward to for several months.

And all I can think about is the number on the scale. And The number of calories in the food and drinks I might eat. I keep plugging into MyFitnessPal different combinations of what I might have for dinner and what I might drink and what I might be craving *after* the show (those pesky drunk cravings!…)

And I’m just miserable. Fuck this. Fuck MyFitnessPal. Fuck the fact that I ran 9 miles today, and walked my dog 3 miles and burned a ton of calories and *still* can’t shake the feeling of my eating disorder controlling my life. Fuck the fact that I ordered Indian takeout last night after a long, difficult day and I ate the whole order and my brain is telling me that I can’t have food and fun and drinks today because of that. 

Fuck all of this."
Recovery,"Feel like I have to “earn” my food  Exercise was never an issue for me when I was actually active in an eating disorder I didn’t exercise and honestly I quite readily acknowledged the fact I simply didn’t have energy to. However now that my intake has been multiplied by 10 (from a ridiculous amount ) I'm finding myself having thoughts of ""earning"" my food before I eat it or ""working it off"", and feeling a compulsive need to walk or exercise constantly. I'm not allowed to do any kind of exercise per advice from my team and I listened to them but lately the feeling is just getting really strong and I almost can’t bear the feeling of sitting or laying or resting. I’m just finding it odd because compulsive exercise wasn't really something I dealt with. Is this feeling really just a manifestation of the guilt I'm feeling towards what I eat ? Has anyone else experienced something similar and has advice? Thankyou <3"
Recovery,"Tips on avoiding relapse  Ive been doing super food for a month or so, littrealy recovered and then today i keep seeing ed vids and thinspo on tiktok and i think i am going to relapse if i see anaymore, idk but i already looked through an account and coudnt stop and tiktok keeps showing me vids"
Recovery,"this sub made me realise i was in quasi-recovery for YEARS  i was on a cycle of heavily restricting and working out, deciding to stop, and going back to eating what i thought was a normal amount - i only realise now that i was still eating way too little. i was still smoking and chewing gum constantly as an appetite suppressant. i had no energy, very irregular periods, brain fog, lots of other symptoms but never connected the dots. i thought i couldn’t possibly still have an eating disorder, because i eat cookies sometimes! 

when i started lifting earlier this year i figured i had to eat more to keep up with the extra calories i was burning, ended up just giving in and eating whatever i wanted. i felt so guilty at first but it was so … freeing. not living under constant fear and guilt takes so much weight off your shoulders (lol). i weighed myself for the first time in months today, and i’m finally no longer considered underweight for my age/height. it’s scary but i know i’m on the right path. feeling proud of myself today <3"
Recovery,"It ain’t much but it’s a start  Fuck me I did it; instead of waiting till night time I just got the box of cereal and started eating, then I had some granola cuz I wanted it. After that I had pretzels  and cashews I did this at like 4:30 and it felt so good to eat that food it tasted so good and yea I ate a shit  ton of the cereal but I didn’t not stop eating at all like I eventually stopped so that fear of never stopping eating is irrational
I know it’s not a whole lot but it’s progress. This is the start of my recovery I am stating that to be held accountable"
Recovery,"Curious about how many recovered people do naturally maintain a low BMI  I posted in another ED sub how it’s really triggering and makes recovery really difficult for me to hear from ED dietitians and therapists how full recovery is possible when they themselves are evidently somehow maintaining a low BMI and wearing fitness trackers, etc. When I did PHP years ago, the group leaders were allowed to eat salads at meal time while some of us (myself included) were crying over bread (I know it’s not logical but non low cal bread is a fear food for me). I know BMI is super flawed and basically bull, and really don’t think it’s natural to maintain a low end of healthy BMI effortlessly. Many disagree. And like I have previously said, I’m trying to challenge my own internalized fatphobia. 

I know that it is a shit ton of work for me to maintain a BMI of >!18-19!< and I haven’t actually been able to go lower because my body simply will not allow it. I naturally have a lot of muscle and I’m basically built like a Quarter Horse so my body absolutely hangs onto that muscle even when I am underweight from a clinical standpoint. Looking back on my medical chart, my weight was stable at BMI of >!21.5-22.5!< pre-ED. 

And I am sure there may be some people out there who do just happen to maintain a low weight without even trying. But in an ED recovery space? How realistic is that? I don’t want reassurance that should I decide to make a full recovery that my BMI will just magically stay on low end of healthy because like I said, my body will not allow it and myself and my sisters and my mother are all built the same. I’m just curious to know everyone’s thoughts on this because this is a primarily recovery oriented sub. But it makes it hard to trust therapists and dietitians who clearly still seem to be disordered."
Disordered,"Just had the worst therapy intake of my life  The therapist asked me to show her my collarbone on video (she could only see my face initially) and said that it didn't look that bad, so I can't have a real ED and my weight was was fine.

Disordered,"Knowing risks but not taking action  I’ve read so much on the effects and health risks of anorexia, knowing it can cause death. I’ve always hated medical stuff and had fears of death, yet with all this knowledge somehow it still isn’t enough for me to recover. I know I’m not unique and that me feeling energized and compulsive to constantly move and walk, and an underweight *bmi* (fuck bmi tho) thinning hair and dry skin on my head and legs means I’m in deep but I don’t get why I can’t just recovery even with all this knowledge.

It's the first time in over 5 years I have eaten that bun, and I just spontaneously decided I wanted it.

Heck I'll go for some hot cocoa and chocolate next with surprisingly little guilt and regret :-)"
Recovery,"Looking healthy?  So I guess I've been trying to recover for like 2 months(ish?). A few days ago, family member commented (I know they only meant well though) that they're glad that I'm looking very healthy now, compared back then (they were referring to the time that I was way thinner and was not in recovery yet. They also don't know that I'm struggling with disordered eating). I feel so bad because I know they only meant well and its not like they knew, but it still affected me all the same. If this is looking healthy, then I guess I don't want to look healthy anymore. I miss my smaller body."
Recovery,"Advice for maintaining recovery after treatment  So I just returned a little over a week ago from residential ED treatment, and I’m working really hard to maintain a regular eating schedule with meals and snacks. It’s going well for the most part (especially considering I’m out of the house most of the day), but I’m wondering if anyone has any advice to make this a little easier to manage. Do y’all like meal prepping the night before?

On Wednesday the 3rd, I met my nutritionist for the first time. I had my session and during it, she told me the reason I could not be weight restoring, is that I'm vaping so much. 

to be honest, I'm really bummed out I have to stop. I stared vaping since November 2021, but I've used it to cope with all my anxiety. and now I feel like I have nothing to rely on. Ofc, I don't have to and I could choose to continue, but some part of me knows it's better for the long run.

Like I’ve wanted to dye my hair since I was a kid and I’ve still yet to dye it because I’m too scared of how I’ll handle it. I refuse to cut my hair ever because they always take too much and I freak out, and of course with having an Ed my hair takes YEARS to grow back.

Recovery,"The paradox of lanugo  Just a post to get out a thought I’ve never been able to share with anyone, but that screws with me regularly.

Since my most recent relapse that came to a head about a year ago (still trying to climb out of that), I realized I have such paradoxical feelings about lanugo. 

First, ever since I was a teenager, nearly 2 decades ago when all this started, I saw it as a badge of honor, because it was a physical sign that I was “succeeding” in my eating disorder. 

I also didn’t really have any interest in having a relationship at that point in time, so I wasn’t worried about how, quite frankly, disgusting it can be to other people. To me, it was just a disordered badge of honor.

Now, nearly 2 decades later, going through this as someone who has been married for over a decade, I look in the mirror and I see lanugo all over both sides of my face, neck, and throat area, and I am first and foremost disgusted. 

I can’t believe that my husband has to see me looking like this every day, and has for a year now. I can’t imagine having to pretend that you’re attracted to someone who literally has an extra coat of hair growing on their face, not to mention elsewhere on my body. 

I focus mainly on my face because that’s where I always see it when I look in the mirror, because I’m usually covering up the rest of my body. 

On the flipside, I’m really struggling with weight restoration and handling a changing body, or even accepting that weight gain is actually necessary. I know all the logical reasons it is necessary, and I’m not asking anyone here to convince me, because if I were able to be logical, I could tell you the same things that you would be able to tell me about exactly what it is, in fact, needed. 

Unfortunately, my brain doesn’t currently care, and my hatred of the lanugo on my face still isn’t enough for me to throw myself into embracing weight gain, which is the only way it will ever actually go away. 

There’s still a small sense of disordered accomplishment when I see it now, like there was nearly 2 decades ago, but by and large, the overwhelming feeling is shame, embarrassment, and disgust that even this is not enough to give me a kick in the ass hard enough to throw my all into this, because the fear is so fucking terrifying. 

Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get it out."
Recovery,"EH after weight restoration and residential?  I'm fully weight restored and more- I actually overshot my pre-ED weight by a good amount. I just got home from residential treatment where I was eating 6 times a day on the highest meal plan, but now that I'm home, my appetite is randomly ravenous. I was eating according to my meal plan, but I randomly ate a cup of granola, 2 Nature Valley bars, 5 Chips Ahoy soft baked cookies, a few squares of Milka chocolate, a couple Thin Mints, and a few gingersnaps in the span of like 10 minutes. When will my EH go away? I don't think I'm restricting, and my body seems to certainly be restored to its original fat and fat free mass amounts."

Recovery,"I have pretty much no enamel in the aftermath of my ED. Can't easily go to the dentist. Is there anything I can do so my teeth are at least presentable?  They're all stained yellow, all the time, no matter how much I brush. I want to yank them out of my fucking head, to be completely frank. I feel like they're going to rot and there's nothing I can do.

I still wear a mask at work, partially because of this insecurity. Does anyone have any ways of whitening or at least making your teeth look better when they've suffered damage from purging (or, in this case, rumination syndrome - involuntary/food not digested)?"
Disordered,"desserts similar in texture/taste to protein bars?  i know i'm probably in the minority here (my tastebuds have always been a bit \~interesting\~, even pre-ED), but i genuinely like the taste and texture of protein bars. even after a full day of completely honouring my hunger for any type of food group, i don't feel truly happy and satisfied until i've had a protein bar (or two...or three). 

but this habit isn't too kind to my wallet, or to my gut (especially because my favorites happen to be the super dense, chewy types with a ton of added fiber), and i'd also like to break away from it because  protein bars have long been a safe food of mine. however, nothing else feels quite as satisfying -- brownies and cheesecake come close but aren't quite chewy enough; mochi isn't quite dense enough; and so on.

does anyone have any suggestions for alternate snacks/desserts to try, or am i just questing (ha) for a non-existent unicorn? do i just need to retrain my tastebuds to prefer ""normal"" desserts more?"
Recovery,IM DOING IT  as I went to go have a really bad relapse today and take diet pills I was able to stop myself after consuming diet pills. I’m giving my scale in my book and everything related to anorexia to my sister so she can throw it away did you do whatever my hair because I’m done I download it all my apps again and I am realizing I’m making such a huge mistake. I even got off this community for a little less than 24 hours and I’m realizing I’m making a big mistake. I’m gonna go eat a snack no matter how hard it is and I am going to recover! Also if anything is spelled wrong or doesn’t look right it’s because I’m using voice to speech because I physically cannot type right now.
Recovery,I am having a hard day because I wasn’t able to do my “normal” workout routine…struggling to eat toady…  
Recovery,"I don’t understand why people post restrictive wieiads on TikTok??  how selfish and careless do you have to be to knowingly influence possibly thousands of people into eds? Let alone trigger many people who already struggle? Literally mind boggling 

theres a runner on TikTok who has posted pro-Ed content FOREVER. Many recovery accounts have recently told her to stop posting— Of course she continues tho ;) i can’t imagine all of the runners and children she has pushed eds on."
Recovery,"Fighting your ED is fighting your need to have control over everything  A lot of people, me included, use ED behaviors as a means of taking control of certain aspect of our lives. We enjoy and find comfort in the feeling of ""control"". If you choose to let go of that control in order to recover from an ED, would that not also result in ""fighting"" the urge to have control in life in general?

What I'm trying to say is, if your ED stems from needing control, wouldn't that mean fighting it is actually you fighting TWO of your fears; both the ED and control (or lack thereof) in life? I know I worded this badly, but I feel like if I can overcome an ED, I can also overcome the anxiety and loss of control I had before my ED. Two birds with one stone, in a sense."
Recovery,"Edtwt is the most toxic hellhole there is  Seriously. I've silenced every word that has anything to do with edtwt and still the pro-ana sh*t manages to get on my feed.

I know these people are sick, sad, and need help but i can't feel anything but hate towards them. They're killing themselves while encouraging other people to do the same. I know they need compassion and love. But I sure as hell can't give it to them. Eating disorders ruin people.

Recovery,"How do you approach going ""all in""?  I told myself I'm ""all in"" about two months ago. However, I don't think I'm all in at all.

I suppose going all in is just as the name suggests:
Honoring every hunger, both physically and mentally, without any restrictions. And without counting calories or having to save or earn calories.

It's just so hard to do. I'm trying to make myself feel better right now, as I ate a lot more than I usually do. With the state my body is in right now, I know that eating more will only help instead of hurting. I need to heal and gain weight. But that's the thing, I haven't accepted weight gain yet. I keep gaining and losing the same amount. 

I'm too scared to let go. I feel like I need to be in control at all times.

Do you guys have any tips or coping mechanisms that helped you?"
Recovery,"i think i'm fully recovered  i think i'm completely recovered! i did the all-in for about a week but i didn't feel like it was the method for me. i followed a plan that had around >!2500 - 3000!< cals on it and i've been following it for around 10 months, 3 meals a day plus snacks. my hunger  cues are  based around the usual meal times now and everything seems to be perfect! i think i eat a  completely balanced diet now, like i have cake and pastries as well as salads and fruits. everything in moderation they say. 

i haven't had any constant food thoughts for months and i'm really happy about it! i was just reminded because my phone showed me a photo of me this time  last year and i can say honestly i have made so much progress! i'm really happy, i can eat in public with friends and make memories with food too. i can't believe i was so scared of being a normal weight before, now i hardly even think about my body. i'm happy i can do sports and all the things my ed stopped me from doing!

Actually Doing A Recovery? 

another note but pre ed i was an Extreme picky eater - i had about three meals i liked and none were stereotypically “”””””””unhealthy “””””” - ive never liked fast food, calorie dense spreads like pb/nutella, the only cereal i liked was bran flakes😭😭 im finding that that on Top of everything is gonna make recovery even harder:( i also dont want to end up stuck with such a limited menu either because that would likely just remind me of ed times😭 any tips would be appreciated://"
Recovery,"Can't sleep in recovery!  Today I was awake all day and then fell asleep at a reasonable bedtime...but woke up 2 hours later and now I'm wide awake at 3am.

Recovery,"I think i’m starting to recover  Today I went to the hospital for a checkup and i had gained weight, but i surprisingly didnt mind that much. i’ve also gotten a bit taller so thats nice. I’m starting to care less about what i eat and how much i exercise :)"
Recovery,"Not gaining weight when honouring extreme hunger…  Is this possible? I know it’s a disordered thought. I know I need to accept weight gain is necessary. But my gosh it would be so reassuring to know that it *might* not result in weight gain aha 😅 I’m thinking like as a result of hyper metabolism maybe?

Secondly, a thought from today because it’s something I’m really working on. For those of you wondering if exercise during recovery is okay…I genuinely believe that for a period of time you *have* to refrain from it completely. Like plop your butt down on the couch and enjoy existence kind of refrain haha. The reason I think this is that the pint of recovery (at least true all in recovery) is to have unconditional permission to eat. For someone with a disordered brain, exercise is automatically a compensatory behaviour…whether you want it to be or not. It automatically makes your eating permission unconditional. I would love to hear your thoughts on this."
Recovery,"stop restricting because it's not worth it  seriously. I tried and my body is now fighting back tooth and nail. my head hurts, I've eaten XXX calories today, and everything is unpleasant all around. I'm still hungry, too and can't sleep"
Disordered,"triggering/mean treatment staff?  Hi!! I am back yet again to ask you kind people for advice to get through treatment and hopefully heal up :') 

&#x200B;

I moved up from IOP to a HLOC a couple weeks ago, and for the most part, I have found it helpful. The other patients have all been amazing and so, so supportive. Unfortunately, some of the staff I've encountered have done and said things that range from humiliating to massively triggering to beyond condescending, all centered around body types/shaming. There have been two incidents that have really stuck with me. I think I'm pretty assertive in my communication (in a healthy way), and I've talked directly with staff each time a comment comes up that is hurtful or triggering for me. Once this resulted in a satisfying resolution...the other time, not so much. I feel like these triggering/mean encounters are having a negative impact on my recovery - does anyone have advice for ways to navigate this? Ideally, I'd like to be able to have some amount of tunnel vision to take what's useful from treatment and leave the rest behind, but I'm currently spending a lot of time feeling hurt as I reflect on the most recent experience, which is also the one that hasn't had a good resolution. I'm trying to ""feel all my feels"" and not suppress the pain of this experience, but it's made meal completion feel so hard!! words of advice very appreciated <3"
Disordered,"family comments make me realize the impact my ed had on them  I entered all in recovery in September after realizing this disorder was going to kill me. I never relapsed, and am now heavier than I was before my ED but could not care less. I eat whatever I want, do not restrict, etc. My family still makes comments that really make me realize how deeply intertwined my existence is with my previous ED even if I was only 'bad' for max 5 months. 

I ask what restaurant we are going to and get the response of ' oh they have salads and stuff too' ... I just wanted to know what restaurant it was 

I say I don't like a certain restaurant (because I don't, not because I'm restricting) and say I will order something else and get the response 'are you sure I can just order you steamed veggies' 

&#x200B;

Recovery,"I HAD A BLIZZARD!!!  I have had blizzards other times, but all of them were followed by behaviours. I have been trying recovery after many attempts and relapses, but I am doing the best I can. I REALLY wanted a blizzard, I was sad to see my dad get one and when I wanted ice cream just get a small sundae. I ASKED my mum to get ice cream today last night, and I even reminded her this morning! I got the flavour I REALLY wanted: strawberry cheesecake! 
When I chevked the nutrition it was higher than what I thought and I hesitated but I just went for it and had the flavour and size I wanted!! It was a larger snack than what I usually have but I wanted one so?????? I told my mum ""is this okay?"" And she told me ""of course! It is delicious isnt it?"". She is so supportive, and I just thought about the flavour and enjoyed every bite, I didn't even eat it extremely fast as I usually do, I just eate it and enjoyed it and now I am just watching a show with my family  no purging, just being happy with the feeling in my stomach and proud of myself 🥰 It gets better, I am SO FAR from being recovered but challenging myself is helping a lot 💜 I want to send everyone strenght today!

Recovery,"I started laughing again  Hey reddit, long time no see (for good reason) 
I guess I'm about 6 months into recovery? I can't put into words the way my overall mood has changed in recovery. I am not obsessed with food all the time. I started drawing again. I can think. I'm making plans for the future. I do things that don't revolve around food. I eat what I want when I want, no rules. The night binges are rare. I make food that actually tastes good. It's still a journey. I still have fear foods (way less!!), I still have weight to gain and a period to get back. But my brain is coming back. I have the capacity to stress about work and moving and my future instead of just hrrrrrrrrrr food. I started laughing again. Over a year ago I noticed that I couldn't remember the last time I really, genuinely laughed at something. But last week, my bf and I bought a huge bag of cereal, poured ourselves each a huge bowl, climbed into bed and turned on a show. I don't remember if he said something or if it was just something in the show, but I laughed. Out loud. And couldn't stop. Covered my mouth to try and hold it in and I couldn't. I can laugh again. I had years of numbness from ED followed by months of what felt like I was clawing myself out and getting nowhere in recovery. But now I'm here, so much further than I thought I could ever come. And it's so worth it."
Recovery,"did your nails grew stronger during/after recovery?  i used to bite my nails hard since early childhood and for the first time i got rid of that ugly habit and managed to grow them out pretty long! that being said, they easily break -in the fucking middle- and it makes me so frustrated since it often forces me to cut one of them really short and start it back. did recovery greatly improved the health of your nails?"
Recovery,I cannot emphasize enough how AMAZING my brain feels when I eat  the way restricting would impact my brain was *insane.* my mind would literally not function and my mood would get so wonky.

Why the fuck did I ever think I’d regret choosing to recover?"
Recovery,"Not sure if this is considered recovery  I have been eating more and having more cravings than I did last year. Whenever my body would give me physical signs of needing to be fed(bc I didn’t know it), I saw it as inconvenience. Now Im on top of knowing what times to eat and what foods to eat. Im even eating the foods I had on a “bad food” list like croissants and muffins for example."

Today he cooked dinner for me and also surprised me with desert and it really made me panic. I ate it but probably looked uncomfortable, and he must have though that I didn’t like it. We’re still pretty early in this relationship and I don’t want to ruin things by burdening him with this so soon. But I also kinda feel like I can’t handle going on more dates involving food with him. What should I do? How should I approach this?"

I feel crazy for being able to eat this much so far into recovery and anyone know why I specifically crave so much fat and salt?"
Recovery,"Spontaneous trip  So I went on a spontaneous road trip with my parents and got to see a lot of beautiful Norwegian landscape. The trip also contained a lot of extra food; despite me for the umpteenth time ""planning"" to restrict my intake after weeks of being gluttonous. Well I ate my normal breakfast and lunch, but we visited a store. So I bought and drank 0,5 liters of chocolate milk and a very large cinnamon bun with tons of frosting. Then I thought I would order a smaller dinner on the trip, and lo-and-behold I ate an entire pizza that would feed 2-3 people, just because it tasted good. I'll still order a pizza tomorrow despite eating it today because it's Friday tradition.

Man going back to restriction is nigh impossible when I could instead eat large quantities of delicious food. I might take a run tonight, but I will make sure to eat a proper meal afterwards despite already eating more than double my planned intake.

Recovery,"The amount of ‘I’m no longer attracted to my spouse/partner because of her/his weight gain’ posts is triggering and infuriating AF  Tw: talk of fatphobia and should mention I am not yet in recovery. This is a vent.

I see copious posts like this in the Marriage and RelationshipAdvice subreddits. The OP *always* mentions loss of attraction and not even being able to look at their own fucking spouse and always asks ‘how to point out that their spouse has gained weight.’ They always make sure to include that their wife/sometimes husband looked “amazing and fit/like a supermodel” and was really into going to the gym/eating healthy until it suddenly all goes to shit. But how should you point it out? Literally fucking don’t. 

I’m sure the person you are with is well aware of their weight gain and having to deal with the crippling realization that their spouse is no longer attracted to them would probably be enough to lead to a full blown eating disorder, if they didn’t already have one. 

My abusive ex constantly made comments about my weight (I was always at a very healthy BMI) and compared my body to the bodies of other women. But he would constantly tell me how “perfect” I would be if I just lost ten pounds, putting me in the closer to UW category. Looking back on it now, he was without question fetishizing anorexic body types. He is precisely what led me to developing a full blown eating disorder that I can’t shake a decade later. 

And the comments in these posts are LOADED with fatphobia and toxic diet culture, like ‘suggest meal planning healthier meals, exercising together/getting a gym membership.’ ‘Maybe it’s a mental health issue/binge eating.’ And there are always even worse comments like, ‘you’re still young and haven’t been married long. You should get out while you can.’ ‘Your spouse let themselves go and you deserve to be with someone who will take care of themselves and their ✨helth✨.’ Fuck that.

People would literally suggest to leave the person someone vowed to spend the rest of their life with over FUCKING WEIGHT GAIN. Like, are you serious? I have a feeling these subreddits are full of awful cis white heterosexual males who think women NATURALLY look like supermodels. It is a full fucking time JOB to look anything remotely close to that. It is an illness. It is exhausting. 

And bodies are SUPPOSED to change. But how can I ever recover when this is how people view weight gain? I am incredibly fortunate to have found my husband who has never made me feel like these men. In fact, he always finds me most attractive when I feel like I look like a hot mess (sweatpants, hair in utter disarray, no makeup, etc.). He has never expected me to look a certain way/pressured me to be thin. But it’s terrifying. I am doing my best to challenge my own internalized fatphobia which I do still struggle with. And these posts get me so HEATED."

Recovery,"OH MY GOD IT REALLY IS POSSIBLE  hi all, woke up this morning and realised I hit 1 year in recovery!

recovery has been weird, it’s like learning how to live life normally again. after 10 (!) years of being trapped in the eating disorder cycle, coming out of it feels like being reborn. been discovering some new interests — learnt that when my brain isn’t fried and malnourished, I actually really love doing word puzzles and sudoku. started reading books, doing pottery, and folding origami too! nowadays my drawings are happy and colourful again. 

started going out with friends and saying yes to things, even when there’s food involved. started trying new restaurants and dishes with ingredients i don’t even know the nutritional values for.  butter isn't scary anymore and neither is oil. nowadays i start to feel excited eating food again, which is something I would've never imagined saying. and MY GOD! the ENERGY I have! no more daily naps, no more fainting...I even feel like a nicer person. maybe it was just from being hangry.  

for the longest time I've only had my ed onto cling to for comfort. I was totally convinced I'd live and die anorexic, the disorder just swallowed me whole. nothing really changed until I accepted the fact that I deserved better than that. everything feels desolate and miserable when you live that way. even on your 'good days' you never really feel satisfied. it’s so unfulfilling and boring. I don't deserve to starve or be in pain - nobody does. 

I’m not going to sugarcoat how recovery is. when you’ve had extensive damage to your body, it will be gross. when you start to eat properly again, expect digestive problems. **it is all temporary and necessary.** if your organs must relearn how to digest food, it is not going to be a seamless process. but near the end of it, when you just stick to it, you will be able to curl up in bed at the end of the day satisfied. not hungry, dizzy, headachey, cold, or feeling your heart palpitate. to feel content and sleep well... recovering from AN has been a LOT physically and mentally, but the level of peace you feel is insane. 

no more obsession, no more brain fog, you can afford to worry about work and school and relationships and petty issues again. when you redevelop your life and personality outside your ed, you will feel fulfilled. you can and you will find passion and satisfaction in something other than losing weight. full recovery has been done by many and it will be done again.

from someone who’s been in the gutter for a decade, this is your gentle reminder to keep going! recovering is a really difficult experience, so remember to stay kind to yourself in the process. wishing you all peace and love!"

Recovery,"Turns out, I've been eating cereal wrong lol  I'm home alone right now. When I woke up, I made my usual bowl of cereal. I don't weigh it out anymore, I just do a free pour. But it never fills me up for too long.

Well, when I'm home alone, I have the tendency to look through the cupboards or cook something for myself, since I don't want to disturb anyone by being in the kitchen. And I love cooking.

Out of curiosity, I decided to replicate the bowl of cereal I had this morning and weigh it out. Turns out, I usually eat half the recommended serving size. And I've gotten so used to it, that it's enough for me, at least in the moment. But now I want to change that. The recommended serving size for cereal is already very small, but half of that? No wonder it doesn't fill me up.

So I decided, you know what, I'm gonna make myself another bowl of cereal. I emptied my favorite coffee granola without weighing it. It definitely was less than the recommended serving size. But since I already had half a serving an hour ago, it adds up to a normal portion.

Now that I know what an actual serving looks like, I'm gonna try to increase my portion. First step :)

Next step would be to increase my lunch from one bread roll to two. Depending on how many my mom brings from work, I might be able to challenge it today. But maybe I shouldn't get ahead of myself. One challenge a day is already great progress.

Also, I'm a bit curious. What's your guy's go-to breakfast? I used to fear cereal, but it's become my favorite way to start the day, especially since I'm a huge sweet tooth. In winter, I'd swap it out for porridge instead. I used to eat skyr and fruit for breakfast, and while I do still like it, it reminds me of my worst times.. I'm glad to have the freedom to eat cereal now :) One day, I want to do one of those ""eating like my childhood self"" challenges, but that would include A LOT of Nutella. And I'm not sure if I'm ready for it. I haven't challenged Nutella yet. But we have a glass that expires in November and it's barely been touched. I hope I can have some before it expires."
Recovery,"How do I stop listening to the thoughts in my head telling to me relapse?  I recovered a year ago. I was loving it and I wasnt thinking about my ed, but now I just miss it. I think a big part in my sudden desire to relapse is my best friend. Shes not eating much lately and shes lost some weight. I miss using my ed as a coping mechanism, I miss the comments Id get from friends and family telling me I was losing a lot and a lot more. The only thing thats making me stop is remembering how miserable my life was and how hard itd be to keep up with my ed considering the fact that I have a job now."
Recovery,"Finally spoke to a nutritionist  I’ve been in recovery for a while and am eating normal amounts again. My thoughts around food haven’t become less obsessive, however, so I finally decided to talk to a nutritionist after debating it with my doctor. I am so ready to forget how many calories a slice of bread has or automatically calculate how much I’ve eaten. I feel like I’ll never reach the end stages if recovery if I don’t take full control of this and I’m hoping this will help me free up the space in my brain that was never meant to be consumed by food."
Recovery,"why am I losing more weight when eating a larger amount of food  Decided to get my shit together since I don't want to end up on bed rest again and I need to work and I have school, I mostly recovered on my own last year around this time and I'm trying to again, but as I eat more I lose more weight? This isn't the first time either, I'd say this happens 80% of the time that I've tried eating more and I really don't know why, besides if maybe i just have a mega fucked metabolism. At one point somehow I was able to maintain a similar weight to what I'm at now (which is very underweight) for about 4 months eating a normal amount of calories for my age and size.

I'm definitely eating more than my BMR, I'm still not eating enough though. But why am I losing faster? I was within a 4lb range for most of July and not really losing or gaining, and then within the past week and a half I've lost another 8 or so? It makes no sense lol"
Recovery,"How do you continue eating without counting or restricting?  Lately I have been having thoughts of counting calories again or restricting which is scaring me honestly as I don’t want to relapse. How do you motivate yourself to keep eating without restriction? I feel like I eat a lot now but I can tell that I am doing so much better with food than I was before as I no longer feel like I need to finish a whole container of something when I open it, such as cookies, chips, etc but if I’m generally hungry or craving it, I can have the whole container. I just don’t want to go back to bad habits but it’s so hard."
Recovery,"Feeling AWFUL after starting eating again yesterday  I don't mind the extreme hunger (and im not eating to point of refeeding syndrome) but I am exhausted and feel ill, huge fibromyalgia flare.

Recovery,Extreme hunger question  So literally hours ago I’ve had some rice dish made by my mom for lunch instead of my safe pizza that I eat everyday and I kept thinking about food after having like 2 bowls of it so I hade cookies with a loaded peanut butter bagel. I am currently in extreme pain. Is this what extreme hunger is like ? My Ed brain is telling me that I binged because I was already full physically
Recovery,"Eating out of control since catching COVID-19  I recently got back from a two-week long work trip to Spain. I'll admit that I was very worried about my eating habits and my weight while I was there: as you can imagine, my schedule was different and the foods that I typically eat were not always available. However, I went through the entire trip with my body remaining exactly the same (which I confirmed via measurements and the scale). This lack of change made me feel relieved as it pointed towards consistency, which is naturally comforting as opposed to any sort of rapid change in appearance. 

However, I noticed that the day leading up to my flight (and on the flight itself) I did not feel very well. On top of being exhausted (which I attributed to the current heat wave in Spain alongside jetlag), it seemed like I was beginning to develop the beginning symptoms of a cold. Besides that, I found myself ravenously hungry. As scary as it was, I just kept eating every time that hunger cropped up (which was about every hour or so) - even if it was foods that did not feel ""safe"" to me. I tried to justify this hunger by the changing time zones and my moving around the airports, but I still felt guilty, comparing what I ate on the flight to that of the people next to me.

I got tested upon arriving in the US (about two days ago) and it turns out that I have COVID-19, which I have never had before. Thankfully, my viral symptoms are fairly mild: I just have a very slight cough and some head congestion. However, my appetite has been absolutely horrifying. I always heard stories about people with COVID-19 losing their appetites, but it seems like all my body wants to do is eat from the crack of dawn to the very end of the evening - and not just eat, but eat the most caloric things that we have in the house. Yesterday I ate nearly an entire pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream in addition to foods like peanut butter, fried eggplant, and other snacks of that nature. Today I was hoping I would be able to get back on track and get some control over things, but I found myself making some edible cookie dough for myself (as I've been craving it for a while) in addition to things like scrambled egg on toast and some cheesecake. I'm still eating things like fruit, but that obviously doesn't counteract all of the other food. I am trying to set meal times for myself, but I just keep feeling hungry outside of them, too. 

My period also started yesterday and my body image is in shambles. I don't know how to describe it, but it looks and feels as if my entire body has been blown up with an air pump. My lower stomach in particular is protruding an absurd amount. I took my measurements and they are more or less the same, but >!the scale read a whole two pounds heavier in only a day (ONE DAY!) of being home.!< I am unfortunately expecting the same result for tomorrow. I just feel so guilty and stressed over this because I don't want to be eating this much food. I do not know why I am feeling THIS HUNGRY when I am barely being active at all. I am still trying to take one solitary walk a day and then do my regular workouts to get some movement in, but I'm of course not going about town like I would if I weren't quarantining. If I try not to eat, the hunger just gets worse and worse and I just wind up eating even MORE. I don't know if it counts as binging; I don't think so because I AM feeling hunger and stop once that hunger goes away, but it just keeps coming back more often than it usually does throughout the day. I just want it to stop and to get back to my regular eating habits that feel way less excessive. >!I'm really scared about how much weight I'll keep putting on during this time.!< I feel so abnormal, out of control, and just downright gross."
Recovery,"what made you go from quasi/semi recovery to actually recovering?  i just feel so stuck. whenever i try to eat however much i want i panic because of the guilt and go back to eating maintenance, enough but not too much. and even when i’m eating adequately i can’t let go of other habits that provide a safety net but actually suffocate me, such as calorie counting (i still count mentally despite deleting apps). i know that what i’m doing right now is better than actively engaging in my ed but it still doesn’t allow me to feel free and i’m so sick of it. yet, full commitment to recovery seems impossible, i have no idea how to get there and actually not go back after a while. is there anything that helped you progress from this stage? if yes, what was it?"
Recovery,"society  ever since i developed my eating disorder (and especially when i started to recover, specifically in the process of unlearning diet culture’s stereotypes and fatphobia) i had started noticing how normalized certain things are nowadays, despite being disordered or morally wrong. 

first off, fatphobia: the way people in larger bodies are shamed and deemed as inferior to those who are thinner, the way the word fat and being fat is seen as something bad (despite it being just a description word for the size of an individual’s body), and insult even, the amount of fatphobic jokes, and the crippling fear of gaining weight that many express. that’s not even half the list, but all of these things are incredibly common and all over the place. 

then we have diet culture: encouragement to under-eat and straight up restrict yourself to amounts that wouldn’t even be sustainable for children, demonization of carbohydrates, classification of food into categories such as “healthy” and “unhealthy”, promoting the idea that you need to justify and/or compensate for food, etc. 

what i’m trying to say is: first of all, the way all these things are ingrained into our minds through diet culture, fatphobic statements, and dumb myths is crazy. a lot of people (if not develop full-blown eating disorders) form plenty of disordered habits. 

honestly, it’s hella tough to recover and get rid of a disordered mindset while all of this surrounds us on a daily basis. but we’ve got to keep pushing through and use every opportunity to become even stronger. we got this! 🤍"
Recovery,"I really need support  Went to residential in April, had a breakup, moved across the country, and have now completed php. Not because I’m ready, but because my insurance is changing and I don’t have enough money to meet the new deductible. 

I was doing so well for a few months and even became weight restored! It’s been so hard trying to recover in a new state with no friends or job and so much stress that comes with being alone. This past month I’ve been symptom swapping and engaging in Ed and substance use behaviors that I hadn’t used for awhile. I feel so helpless. Trying to figure out an outpatient team is so overwhelming and I truly don’t think I’ll ever be free from my Ed or addictions. 

I’ve tried really hard to not have lapses turn into relapses but I feel like I’m one of those people who will always have to deal with something. In my case, it feels like harm reduction is the best possible solution.

 I wish money wasn’t part of the equation: I hate that I have to get a job because I can’t afford treatment anymore. I hate that weight restoration is so hard to maintain without support from a team 24/7.

It would be really helpful if I can have some words of encouragement or even validation for this never-ending process."
Recovery,"How to prepare for PHP, and getting disability while in treatment?  Tldr; what should I know about going to PHP? And can you get short term disability while in treatment?


So. I have been trying and failing to recover for a while now. Saying I’d start eating more at X point (but always pushing X point further once I reach it). Saying I’d gain weight by May, June, then July (here we are at August and I’ve hit a lw). *Promising* I want to recover but never being able to take the consistent steps needed for it. 

Finally I’ve accepted I need a HLOC and have *actually* taken steps to start one (instead of just saying I will). They recommended PHP and I will need to take a leave from my beloved job while I get help. Has anyone been successful at being approved for short term disability while at PHP? This seems so complicated to get my doctor to fill it out. 

I’ve done inpatient, resi, PHP, and IOP before but these were all over 10 years ago. I have no clue what to expect (aside from 2 snacks and lunch) or if I should bring anything. I’m still waiting to here when my intake appointment will be but in the meantime do y’all have any words of wisdom for someone going into PHP?"
Recovery,"what do i do with extreme hunger at night?  i’m still working at/struggling with consistently eating throughout the day and eating “adequately”. i struggle with feeling SO hungry in the middle of the night, enough that it hurts and i can’t sleep. am i supposed to eat? what do i do? i realise this will probably resolve itself with regular and increased eating but yeah. i know it sounds stupid but i don’t know how to respond to this since i’m used to just ignoring hunger cues"
Recovery,"Weight gain (again)  So I gained weight again this week, which I kind of expected, but it just seems to be a pretty big jump. I mean I know gaining weight is inevitable and can’t be avoided in recovery, but does it mean I’m eating too much? I don’t even feel like I’m fully honouring my hunger but what if that makes my weight go up even faster? How can I be this hungry and gain so much?? 

Sorry I know this is a disordered ED rant/question, and I already kind of know what the answer is. I guess it just helps to hear it from other people."
Recovery,"Feeling guilty about buying lunch, I think I need help  Sorry for the bad English.

For some context, I've (ENBY, 18) been struggling with my relationship with food since being a young child, and recently my therapist has brought up to the conversation that I show some signs of ED. I also have been dealing with MDD and anxiety since childhood.  I feel like I'm kind of on edge. I always check calories and ingredients in food. I always think how I'm gonna organize eating based on 'will I go out?', 'what will be available to eat where I'm going?', 'how much I have eaten and what have I eaten?'. If I can avoid eating, I do it. I think to myself 'do I really need to eat right now or can I postpone it a little more?'. I lie about what I have or haven't eaten because 1) Some times I skip foods 2) I'm embarrased of saying out loud that I have eaten and discussing food, or saying food names out loud. I have signed up for many sports at the same time, ending up tired and overworked, and although I loved those sports, my main reason was to change my body. Some times, I get anxious and uncomfortable with the way I look and how clothes fit me. I can't see myself in pictures. I see old pictures and realized how distorted my perception of how I actually looked was, and I can't trust myself on knowing how I actually look right now. I feel overweight, disgusting, heavy and unatractve. I have avoided going places because I didn't like my body and how I looked. I have missed family reunions, parties, events. I recieve a lot of comments on my body from my family.

Combined to all this, one of my parents is a very frugal person and always taught that I should avoid spending money unless it's absolutely necessary. So, back to the title of this post, today at work I didn't bring anything to eat so by lunch time I went out to buy something to eat. I said to myself ""today I won't restrict, just eat a normal lunch like everybody else"". So I bought lunch and had half of it (I feel full) and now I feel guilty and embarrased and disgusting. I feel like I shouldn't have bought what I got, that I shouldn't have eaten and I feel like throwing up. I have never made myself throw up, but (specially lately) eating makes me nausceous and I feel like throwing up.

I don't know what's the point of this. I guess I needed to write it down."

Disordered,"Obsessing over weight  How do I stop thinking about my weight all of the time? I’m sick of it. I’ve never properly recovered, and the obsession is getting worse. I guess for some context, I had a friend die a year ago and it really brought my issues back to life. I’m a runner and have been for about 12 years, because I love running but it also makes me obsessed with my weight, especially since I was heavier than I was before and now I’m running slower. I’m also a personal trainer because I love fitness, but it’s like my passion intertwined with my eating disorder a lot and I don’t really know what to do about it. How do I separate what I love with an eating disorder?"
Disordered,"Protein bar companies and recovery influencers  Is anyone else noticing that an increasing amount of recovery influencers on Insta are doing promotions for protein bars? 

It is not sitting right with me, I feel it's predatory of these protein bar companies (who are, I think, inherently complicit in and a part of diet culture) to be approaching influencers and I am disappointed in these influencers for taking part in these promotions. 

I don't want to see recovery influencers partaking in any aspect of diet culture. What next - are they going to post about high protein meal replacement shakes?! 

These low sugar high protein bars are diet cultures latest obsession. Deep in my ED I basically lived off them. 

I'm actually flabbergasted to see these influencers posting about them. 

And I think the companies know exactly what they're doing - and it's so fucked up. 

Sorry, just needed to rant, surely I'm not the only one who's noticed this. 

I am just going to unfollow all recovery influencers who do this. But I almost want to call them out and be like - what are you playing at?!"

Freaking out about how my body is going to handle it. Not sure what I should do about restricting, and how I should handle my exercise/walks. 

I’m severely underweight, like nearly at my IP pre-admission weight from last year. I don’t feel too bad now so will push on with my exercise plan (which is just walking) because it does help my anxiety. Not sure if I should keep restricting, eat my BMR or my maintenance? Not that I believe my maintenance is as high as it supposedly is.

My head is a mess, just really don’t know what to do."
Recovery,"Peoples obsession with “health” is beyond triggering  I recently made a post on ex-vegans talking about reintroducing animal products as a way to honour my cravings and overall the support was amazing and so comforting. 

However some of the responses were quite triggering in terms of basically shaming and discouraging the type of food I’d eaten in honouring my cravings. 

I know I have internalised ideas of what I should and shouldn’t eat but I’ve never put those expectations on others. 

It also seems crazy to me saying to a person who’s admitted to having an ED to cut out/restrict certain food groups. 

I’ve tried healthy eating and balanced meals so many times in my life but it always leads down a restriction ED spiral.

So right now I’m not concentrating on “health”, I’m concentrating on my relationship with food but it is so difficult with people projecting their ED thoughts and behaviours on me. But I guess getting used to that is a part of recovery!"
Recovery,I did it!!!  Im so freaking proud of myself right now. I hate going out to eat with people for the most part unless they’re family but I went out with a friend to a Mexican place and had two fajitas and chips and queso. It’s little but I’m so happy I could do it. I considered last minute canceling and I’m so so glad I didn’t.
Recovery,"GERD and fatty liver  I have been recovering from disordered eating for past year and a half. I wish i had known long term impact of restricting. I have really bad GERD, literally everything triggers it. I also developed fatty liver. The pain from my digestive issue is unbearable, I am seeking support for it but its not quick fix. One good thing, I guess, is that my GERD acts up if i need to eat, and I make it a point to eat."
Recovery,"Anxiety of gaining weight… even if it is muscle  Ive been a binge eater for about 14 years. I always denied my ed since I was always within my normal bmi. However it caused a continual 35 pound weight loss/gain post high school.

Over the last 8 months I’ve thrown out my scale and been focusing more on eating for health while not obsessing my food. I began working out in the last few weekss. This has allowed me to gain muscle and crave more food due to the calories I’ve been burning. Most of my clothes don’t fit now and I’m starting to obsess over food again. I cried today over this because I don’t want it to take over my life again. Now my only goals consist of severe food restriction. 

I feel like I can’t afford new clothes even if I do thrift most of the time. I just want to be healthy and I need helping finding a new mindset."

Hey y’all. I’m on month 5 of all in recovery. And I’m losing steam. My EH/MH isn’t decreasing, I’m still eating between like >!3k!< -idk probably >!6.5/7k!< a day. I’m still craving calories dense, highly palatable food and I can’t even stand the thought of eating vegetables most of the time (which genuinely makes me so sad because I used to LOVE veggies :( ). I have gone from >!125-160!< in 5 months and I’m horrified. My pre ED weight was >!150!< and I know my body has always preferred to be solid. But after hitting my lowest at >!110!< and gaining >!70!< lbs of all fat, I just feel like I can’t trust my body. It should be done by now.

Recovery,"Time of month tied to more severe ED thoughts / intake and drs words impacting asking for help  Does anyone else have the worst psychological revulsion to food after their period, if they have one?

And the dr told me to ""Keep it up!"" My BMI is normal now. That's what these people base their idea of fitness off, right? Why did he have to say that? Yesterday I was talking to my primary care dr on the phone and he hesitated to give me Plan B because I was over the weight limit. I reminded him that I wasnt anymore. ""Oh that's GREAT!"" The final ten pounds was water weight from a medication I stopped, im the least healthy I've ever been in my life. But its all gravy because ten pounds moved me into ""normal"" BMI now I'm wondering if the dr said ""keep it up"" because he thinks I need to ...scheduling with a specialist when I go to acupuncture clinic in a week.

But after having eaten a bit more than usual, my body image started to shift again. I didn't like what I saw in the mirror. I felt too big.

I don't know what to think anymore.. I look a lot sicker in images and videos than I do irl. Or maybe it's just my body dysmorphia playing tricks on me..

Recovery,"learned something new today!  Ok so here I was, thinking after some level of disordered eating since I can remember, treatment for bulimia as a teen, which did not have the desired effect, because I actually spent most of the actually ill years being anorexic, total of 4 rounds of recovery, 2 times with significant weight gain... 
Thinking I knew just about everything about this illness and getting better...

But no. 
Today, I learned there is a thing called extreme hunger. 
Which I have never experienced (and likely never will because round 5 is about stabilising at a functional level, like round 4 was... 'recovery' for me is about taking responsibility for my problems and learning to find and maintain a healthy enough balance). 

Bodies are fascinating, to create that in order to get healthy! It's actually amazing. 
Keep up the good work people! Not just the hungry people, but everyone who made a decision today which furthered their health.

i apologize if this post is triggering, but i have to say this. you have to recover NOW or you’ll die

when i decided fuck it and started recovering, I BASICALLY HAD NO OTHER CHOICE THAN DEATH! 

things i have suffered due to anorexia:

1- **MY TAILBONE CAME OUT OF MY BACK!** literally. this was basically what mainly pushed me to recovery. i was going downstairs at a hospital, was so tired i missed a step and fell onto my butt down each stair. idk why i passed out after and my mom had to carry me into the car. at home, my mom noticed a huge blood stain on the back of my shorts (i thought i got my period, how funny😹) and found out that my tailbone literally punctured through my skin. had that fixed but now i have a permanent scar in my asscrack👍

2- **MY GRANDMA WOULD CARRY ME INTO CARS/UP STAIRS/SIDEWALKS!** i literally reached a point where i could not walk for more than 5 mins without blacking out and my 70 YEAR OLD GRANDMA would help me do basic human functions like opening/closing my car door and helping me take a step up a sidewalk. 

3- **SEVERE BRAIN FOG/ MEMORY LOSS!** like i genuinely do not remember a single specific memory at the time i was malnourished, just general periods of time (this improves DRASTICALLY with recovery, a new world opens up!!) i also could not keep up a conversation for more than a couple mins as i would get so exhausted. 

4- **I HAD NO BLADDER CONTROL!** i literally don’t know why but i’ve pissed myself so many times while on the way to the bathroom, cause when my bladder was full it would literally empty itself on its own. (embarrassing) 

5- **BRUISES FROM SITTING/SLEEPING!** i reached a point where even laying down on a mattress would cause my ribs/bones to bruise and turn blue (ouch)

6- **DIGESTION PROBLEMS!** everyone says this but you either shit pure water for days (i would still refuse to eat starch to help💔) or not shit for a month, no in between. 

7-**EXTREMELY LOW HEART RATE!** my heart rate was in the low 30s even when i would walk and my parents would check up on me while sleeping since they were scared i would die in my sleep!

The worst part is that Im still scared to honour it completely. I know I can have the food later on but my body is right now in this moment screaming “food” and I feel like a total shit. It’s just so tiring."
Recovery,"a thing I don’t get about recovery  I don’t get how I’m supposed to gain weight before fixing my body image.

I once posted somewhere on how disgusting I felt about my body because of recovery weight gain and some people said that I have to gain weight first and do the psychological work after that because apparently my brain is too starved for therapy. And I think it’s a widespread belief that you can’t work on your body dysmorphia before you start to eat more and I just don’t understand why exactly?Like yeah,my brain functions worse when I undereat but it’s not like I’m in a vegetative state or have lost my ability to think rationally. So long story short I relapsed.
My current therapist insists that I don’t restrict while we work on my ED but I literally can’t because the disordered thoughts which lead to restricting are not fixed yet. And I know she can’t be all like ""ofc feel free to starve yourself all you want it’s fine"".Idk it just feels like many people think there’s only one right way to recover and any deviation from it is disordered. Maybe I’m just trying to justify starving myself like ""fuck all those people who wish me the best and don’t want me to starve myself,how dare they force recovery on me!!1"". But if I fixed my psychological problems first it would be a lot easier to accept the weight gain.Maybe there’s something I don’t understand here."
Recovery,"the night eating isn't even enjoyable anymore  i wake up every single night and eat probably a whole meals worth or more

at first I kind of liked it I ate and it almost felt guilt free (until I woke up and had a breakdown) but then it never stopped

I'm still probably not eating enough during the day and the fact that I skate probably doesn't help either.

but now its barely enjoyable, I don't even remember everything j eat I can't decide whether to wake up with pride (because my brain still tries to eat as little as possible) or have a breakdown over how much I ate

it's been months. I'm fully weight restored. yet I still restrict and overeat at night, I don't even know what to do or why I posted this just ranting. I hope this torture ends eventually"
Recovery,"My cousin has an eating disorder. How do I deal with it?  My cousin (17, F) used to have a healthy body a few years ago. She would eat happily eat with us, without any worry. I don't exactly remember when, but around the beginning of the pandemic she started to lose weight. She would tell us about her new exercise regime and diet. We thought nothing of it at first, but we slowly noticed how she would exercise for 2 hrs every time, she would eat way less, and eventually start to vomit the little food she had. 

This went on for more than a year, until she admitted to us a couple of months ago that she knew what she was doing was wrong, and misses the times where she would eat without much restriction. She's been trying to recover ever since but she says that her body can't help but vomit out what it intakes. Aside from that, our extended family has been reproaching her and making her feel guilty for her condition. Now she's ashamed of her condition and doesn't want professional help because of how costly it would be for her family. She blames herself for the condition she has. 

I don't know how to help her, I don't know anything. The best I can do is to push her to professional help, but what can I do when she herself tries to reject that help, saying that she doesn't care if she dies early; if her body can't take the damage from her eating disorder, then it can't."
Recovery,"Things I LIKE about recovering into a larger body  Feel free to remove this if it goes against any rules, but I thought I'd make a positive thread for once, that celebrates the improvements in quality of life that come hand in hand with weight gain.

As part of my recovery, I've ended up ""obese"" by bmi. However society sucks, and being ""obese"" actually isn't the worst thing in the history of the world ever. A lot of the time society literally behaves like being dead is preferable to not fitting its extremely narrow beauty constraints. However realising that thats bullshit, I also realised that there ARE real positive upsides to being in a larger body which aren't ever discussed about because of shaming and fatphobia in society.

-Cushioning for injuries. When I was at my lowest weight, I managed to fracture one of my ribs in my sleep by knocking my elbow into it... WTF. In a larger body, I'm not terrified of accidentally bumping into things, or opening a door or closing a cabinet with my side, and I know if I trip and fall on my face due to being clumsy AF I'll only be humiliated instead of actually hurt like I could have been before.

-Periods!!! I never got consistent periods at a low healthy bmi and need to be near the overweight range for them to be regular. Now I can predict when it'll hit almost to the hour every month...

-A digestive system that works. 

-Being much stronger! I can lift all sorts of heavy things without breaking a sweat. I used to be the type of person who asked other people to open water bottles for me, now people ask ME to open water bottles for them lol

-My hair is rich, glossy as thick. I have natural curls but they disappeared at my LW, now I have them again (and the energy to take care of them!)

-Bigger lap for my cat to lay on lol

-Never getting sick anymore. Someone could sneeze directly on me and my immune system won't break a sweat, when before I caught every cold, virus and fungal infection in a 3 mile radius.

Feel free to add your own!"

Recovery,"Tell me not to do it  Almost seven months of full recovery, after trying to get to this point for the last three years, and I’m telling myself “Just one month. We’ll see what makes you happier”. I just need someone to tell me not to. Remind me why I have to recover."
Recovery,Heading to Hospital With Liver Failure  Age 32 male and still balling like a little child.  It is so lonely and scary and all they are doing is sticking me and feeding me.  What did you all experience or how long were you there?
Recovery,"social anxiety and eating  I need help! So my dumb ass is letting a friend stay with me for TWO WEEKS in my tiny studio apartment bc she had nowhere else to go. Unfortunately, it’s basically impossible for me to eat with other people around. Meals can be okay, but I feel so embarrassed to eat snacks, which is a problem bc I’m used to eating basically 6 small meals a day. Idk how to cope with this. It makes me so angry and anxious that she’s around all the time, screwing up my normal food routine. And I feel weird eating my “safe” meals because they don’t look “normal enough,” and I’m scared of being judged. How do I keep eating when it’s so viscerally uncomfortable to do so with another person in my space?"
Recovery,"I FINALLY GOT MY PERIOD BACK I’M SO HAPPY I COULD CRY  I got my period back after who knows how long, but I’m super happy about this !!

I told my friend that I got my period but she said that’s not something to celebrate and that I was luckier for not even having my period (her aware of my situation).

But it’s whatever, I’m so proud of myself and how far I’ve gotten."
Recovery,"First few days of recovery  When you went for recovery, what did your first 4 days-week look like?  Just eating all day whatever you want, adding in a few things each day, eating loads one day and then less the next, etc? Moreso specific to those who went all in!"
Recovery,"I feel alone  Hi I’m 17f who admitted herself into the children’s hospital May 30th of this year. I’ve been in the hospital for about 2 months and I feel hopeless and depressed. Everyday feels the same and I’m sick and tired of it. I was in the emergency room for a month and now i’m only at the hospital lunch now, I have earned passes and they get longer as I get better. I want to be assessed by my psychologist but apparently my brain isn’t nourished. I’m sick and tired of the doctors and my parents telling me that my brain is still unwell from the malnutrition. I’m sick and tired of seeing my body in the mirror and noticing the weight gain. I hate myself and my body I hate how i did this to myself I hate how this illness ruined my summer and my life. I just want to be a normal teenager and to have a normal summer. I’m sick and tired of people showing me pity. What I’ve learned from this whole experience is that people only care about you when your stuck in a hospital bed. I hate my life and I see no hope in the future. I wish I was out and I wish I can exercise and move again like I used to. I wish I could hangout with people and not be stuck at home all day. I spend the whole day just moping around and eating. Please help, how do I get through this awful feeling…"
Recovery,"i wish i had never started restricting  it was so not worth it. ive made myself suffer only to suffer more later by trying to undo all the damage i have inflicted onto myself. recovery is difficult and it seems like im getting nowhere. though i know i am, and thats why im not going to stop. it’s just exhausting. the extreme hunger that never ends, my physical state that doesnt seem to get better, and my worsening mental one. im aware that recovery is tough, and i have no choice but to stick with it but im just so mad that i started this all in the first place. i wish i could undo it, and now im desperately trying to but i feel as if im not progressing further. regardless, im doing this. doing this despite crying every night (not to be dramatic), doing this despite the discomfort from extreme hunger and despite the dark, intrusive thoughts. i got this… i guess."
Recovery,"Vacation leeway with food choices  Despite it being conventionally ""unhealthy"", I have now managed to enjoy delicious ""unhealthy"" things almost every day for a week!

Tuesday - didn't fancy anything

Wednesday - Hot cocoa

Thursday - Waffles

Friday - Ice cream

Disordered,"Food to recover  I want to preface this by stating that I’m trying to restore my relationship with all foods and movement to escape the hell that I’ve lived in for years. I just have a kinda scientific query. 

Restoring nutritional health/fat:fat free mass etc seems to be one aspect of recovery, along with neural rewiring. 
From an evolutionary point of view, if we were in famine as cavemen, as many of our ancestors with our genetics were, processed foods would not have been available for obvious reasons. Did human physiology adapt and evolve to replenish body stores, etc by eating minimally processed foods? Has modern industrialised society hacked this process, and can this somewhat disregulate our metabolism as a result if we choose more palatable processed food to recover?

I know the psychological aspect of this disease is arguably a much bigger problem. I’m sure many of you would contend that putting morals on food choices precludes recovery in the first place. 
I honestly don’t mean to guilt anyone for however they choose to eat, I’m just interested in getting your opinions and learning from your experience of recovery."
Disordered,"Differentiating Extreme Hunger vs Binge  Hi all,
My history with food, body image, and exercise is complicated to say the least. Without going into too much detail, over the past year/ year and a half I have been struggling with restricting/ binging, periods of over exercise, and I think I’ve been experiencing extreme hunger all along and not feeding it.

My struggles with this really started a year and a half ago when I was experiencing severe GI issues (some of which I still have) and was put on a super restricted diet. I later found out that I have a bunch of allergies/ intolerances as well (allergic to 6/8 main allergens). So, my diet was inherently restricted due to my GI symptoms and allergies. Along side of this I fasted and or had time restricted feeding windows in an attempt to help with my GI distress. On top of all of this I am EXTREMELY active. Over 20,000 steps a day at work, plus running/cycling 5-6 days a week, and 2-3 days of strength training per week. 

Everything compounded and led my body to be in a imbalanced state for a very long time. My restriction and then inevitable binges have gotten so out of control recently I realized that I really need help. One thing that was really messing me up was restricted feeding windows. I would only allow myself to eat at meal times. Absolutely no snacking in between. Even if I had finished a long hard workout I would still wait until meal time to eat most of the time. 

I have a therapist and we’ve discussed the basics of my eating disorder, but I have still been struggling a lot in silence.

I took it upon myself to meet with an Ed centric Dietician last week and she prescribed that I eat 3 meals and 3 snacks a day. The snacking was new to me as I only allowed myself to eat at meal times. Snacking has been difficult because my body is so used to only getting food at certain times, it keeps telling me to eat more.

Now with the context set, I’m struggling to differentiate a binge vs extreme hunger. I guess with binges they are either a result of restriction or some kind of emotional problem Im trying to cope with food. My mental hunger is through the roof at all times. I was quite literally always thinking about food. Is “giving in” to the mental hunger and eating a lot of food all at once a binge or extreme hunger? I struggle to stop eating whenever I start and that’s why I started restricting so much. 

Another thing I need to address is my activity levels. I’m currently training for a triathlon so my daily needs are higher than most. I need some form of exercise   in my life but I am considering pulling back on this for now until I get healthy.

My question is should I listen to this mental hunger and eat 100% unrestricted in the hopes that my hunger/fullness cues return? I really need to get a grip on this.

If you made it this far, I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read it.

Thank you"
Disordered,"I might be triggering for my friend and I feel awful about it  My friend and I know each other since last year and she is just an year older than me, in the past week we joined together a volunteering camp where I really tried to challenge myself to eat more and in a non disordered way. 

I didn’t succeeded everyday, it was rough and at the end I didn’t manage to eat pasta as I would have liked or having a snack in front of others instead closed in the bathroom because I was too embarrassed. 

Although no one really pointed out my behaviours and no one noticed. But my friend referred in a subtle way to how light I am, how much will power I manifest (it was related to the fact that I got injured and I di don’t complain at all). Then we all went to the sea side, where I worn a bikini and played games despite being ungodly uncomfortable. But still no one could tell and I was praised for looking so confident
Than we were building a human pyramid and everyone was insisting for placing me at the top being the lightest and I was embarrassed and I rather suggest to place one of the younger girls 

My friends snapped “come on you must weight at least 20kg less than me” and is true 

My friend have really bad self esteem problems and we agreed that seeing a phycologist would be really beneficial. In our way home I noticed she was comparing all her photos and she opened up about how much she despise her body and about her mother 

It was so hurtful and I recognised a lot of disordered thoughts and in general a really bad situation, but this isn’t effecting (for now) her relationship with food. I tried to explain that she look good, she genuinely do, bad that she do is attractive for someone around… but still she told me “you must weight at least 20kg less than me” 

It’s so painful, she is her, my friend, even if she weights more than me and is build like a door. I fear I am triggering 

I know that it’s not actively my fault but GOD is awful"
Disordered,"Tips for finding community in recovery?  Obviously this can feel like a really isolating thing to go through… I am only at the very beginning of my recovery and while I have told my boyfriend and my best friend, and am grateful for their love and support, I feel really alone in this process. I’d really like to connect with other people struggling and find a group or community somehow which could provide emotional support and motivation to recover, but I don’t know where to begin :/ 

Has anyone had any good experiences in finding community in recovery or any tips for where I could begin to look?"

Disordered,"Do you have any advice on how to stop comparison in recovery?  Hey guys ! I'm in early recovery from a restrictive eating disorder and something I really struggle with is comparison. For exemple if I want an ice cream but no one else does then I'll probably won't eat the ice cream because I don't want to eat more than others... However if everyone is eating ice cream I will also get one :) But yeah do you have any advice on how to stop comparison and finally be able to fully concentrate on what I want to eat regardless of what other around me are eating (or not eating) ?
Thanks Xx"
Disordered,"How do you deal with bad body image days?  I’ve been having them recently and it’s very triggering aha. 

For a few days I haven’t been able to go on my regular walks, which both is and isn’t a disordered habit (I genuinely enjoy my walks and it’s a time for me to clear my head and jam out to music, but it’s also been my primary form of exercise) and I ate a bit more high cal foods than maybe I normally would— which I thought should be fine, I’m challenging myself and my ED and I should be allowed to eat yummy food! But now I’m feeling intensely guilty and bad about myself and the way I look. 

I have IBS and my stomach *has* been upset that last day or two, so that might be part of it, but I can’t shake this fear that I’ve failed myself somehow (even though logically I know there’s nothing wrong with gaining weight or looking any type of way). I don’t want to hide out in my usual comfy clothes because it’s hot af outside and I don’t want to reinforce the idea that I have to ‘hide’ my body, but I’m also terrified of wearing clothes that show off everything I’m insecure about right now. I’m terrified of what people will think of me, especially my family for some reason because I’ve always been the ‘small’ one. 

I haven’t yet worked up the courage to talk to anyone in my real life about this disorder, so I’ve been attempting recovery on my own for 2-3 months now. But I have no idea how to get through these types of days without slipping into disordered thoughts and habits, or at least letting it ruin my whole day"

Disordered,"relapsing after a year of progress, seeking advice  Hi all,

I've never posted here but have often read threads for support and have always appreciated this recovery-oriented space. I feel like I've really messed up. About a month ago, my dietitian and I decided that I no longer needed to be on a meal plan or log my meals after a tough year of gaining weight and pursuing recovery. A little background - I am now twenty years old and have been in and out of ED treatment since I was twelve, never could really shake the damn thing for more than a few months at a time. When I came off my meal plan this time, I did ok for maybe a week, but then something snapped and I ended up downloading my fitness pal and starting to obsessively count my calories. I'm eating very low calories and am also very active as a college athlete which I know is a recipe for disaster but I'm afraid to be honest with my dietitian about it because I hate the thought of going back to a meal plan. I also have to admit I lost significant weight this month and part of me is afraid of having to gain it back as well... I thought about slowly increasing my calories but still tracking it but I know that's also a pretty shit idea. Altogether, I feel very stuck and any words of wisdom would be welcome."
Disordered,"I feel like recovery isn’t supposed to be this hard  Like it’s supposed to be hard i know, but not this hard. I’m literally falling apart at the seams and every day I wake up is just misery until I manage to fall asleep and then wake up and repeat the next day. I swear I’ve been having a week long panic attack, like my anxiety and nerves do not let up ever and it’s literally hell to experience. Half my day is spent crying and the other half eating. I’m unable to function or get anything done because i’m unmedicated for my ADHD so I legit just stare at the wall or at my phone all day while the chatter in my head just goes on and on and on. I feel like all in wasn’t a good idea for me because I don’t have any coping mechanisms set up for my other mental health problems and I have no idea what to do. I literally feel like I’m living in hell. I also feel like my 24/7 heightened cortisol / nervous system is gonna make my extreme hunger last forever. I’m sad and stressed and panicking and afraid of getting pushed into a relapse. I hate this I just want to be at peace and have my life back"
Disordered,"How do you handle intuitive eating/going back to eating like you did pre-ED?  I know the answer may seem a bit obvious, ""just eat when you're hungry, stop when you're full,"" but as I'm sure we all know that is much easier said than done.

I struggled with an eating disorder for about two years; pretty under weight, dangerously low heart rate, near hospitalization. I went on a meal plan about seven months back and I've been back to healthy weight for about a month. The thing is: I'm still terrified of weight gain and struggle to not count calories. I'm at the point where my hunger cues are back and stable, but every day is still a mental war. Intuitive eating is tough because I have reliable hunger cues but am still obsessing over foods, eating the same meals because I know their calories, and having minor freak outs when I ""go off track"" according to what I set up in my head.

I guess my question is: how do you all handle intuitive eating while still experiencing difficult thoughts? I haven't had a true non-calorie-counting day in weeks because I'm so terrified of what my mind has villainized for years. Do you all have any tips for intuitive eating and getting back to eating like you did pre eating disorder? Thanks!!"
Disordered,Why in recovery some people have extreme hunger and some don't ?  I'm just curious 🧐?
Disordered,"EH and anxiety on vacation  A couple weeks into extreme hunger, it doesn't seem like it will lower any time soon and that's fine. Next week I'm going on vacation with my family. I live alone so there wasn't anyone to judge me so far for eating. I don't think my family will judge or comment. But so far I was always able to go any buy in a store right next to my flat whatever I'm craving. On vacation we don't have a supermarket nearby and I'm kind of worried what will happen when the mental hunger on something specific happens and I can't have it (bc i would have to drive to the next store or bc they don't have it in the country). Also kind of afraid that my siblings eat the stuff I want and bought for me. 
Or that we go out for dinner and I don't feel satisfied after the meal. I know that I can (and will) take lots and lots snacks with me everywhere we go but I still feel so anxious about not getting enough food. Really unnecessary because even when I eat everything I take with me there will probably be a possibility to buy more food.
Still I feel so much anxiety and panic thinking about this vacation.

ED me would have worried about how they look in a bikini on the beach or panic about eating out because of uncontrollably calories. Kind of funny that that isn't on my mind anymore at all."
Disordered,i hope this is ok to post here bc y’all seem to be pretty educated on recovery  
Disordered,"I wish I could separate my body image issues from food  I’ve never had great body image, and I’ve always been especially insecure about my legs. But, I’ve always still been relatively thin and never experienced fatphobia, so I’ve never experienced any kind of oppression based on my body type. I never felt extremely confident about my body, but looking back on it, especially as I got a bit older (but before my ED developed), my insecurities didn’t interfere with my life very much. I never had body image days so bad I couldn’t leave the house or socialize. 

But the thing I miss the most is that a bad body image day before my ED would never interfere with my eating. It never even crossed my mind to skip a meal if I felt especially bad about my body. Now it crosses my mind nearly every time I look in the mirror on a bad day. I just wish I could go back to never thinking about the way food would affect my body — just eating what I wanted, when I wanted, and never thinking twice about it, even if I didn’t feel great about my body. 

Man I wish I could go back to when my ED first developed and just slap myself. None of this is worth it. It’s so hard to deal with these thoughts constantly, every single day."
