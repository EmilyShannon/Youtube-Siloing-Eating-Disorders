My acid reflux is back too. I started doing it every meal just like before. Nothing happened thats really screwed me over so I dont know why I started eating to the point where I need to throw up to feel better again. \n\nThe thing is my bulimia was never about body image and that makes me question if it\'s even valid or bulimia I don\'t know.

They avoid me, "jokingly" hide when they see me, and the only reason they messaged me (after I gave up trying) is to get them something since they can\'t. I think they never really liked me lol. I don\'t talk to my parents anymore since they suck and my boyfriend lives far away. I don\'t know why it\'s affecting me so much now, I\'m used to it (from childhood) but it kinda sucks being alone. It\'s not like I can make new friends because I always feel like I\'m annoying people and i dont know how really. \nI got off topic lol\n\nIt\'s probably back because of that but I don\'t exactly know what I can do about it.

I’m not sure what clicked for me, but I’ve been in recovery for one year on September 15th (a year since I was hospitalized with internal bleeding due to this disorder). Throughout recovery, I relapsed over and over again to the point where it didn’t feel like I was actually in recovery, just saying I was so people wouldn’t worry. But out of no where last month I kind of just decided that enough was enough. Once I told myself that purging just simply was not an option and I didn’t want to do it anymore, I was actually able to stop. I’ve had a few small binges where I would just dissociate while eating, and in those cases I would start to think “well, might as well keep going and throw up”, but I was able to be like “you’re not even enjoying what you’re eating, try to stop and do not purge”, and then I would almost laugh at myself and then finally would put the food away. Now I’ve always done this at night, so it was easy to put down the food and go to sleep, during the day I’d say this would be harder but for me the night time has always been my “time to shine” bc everyone was asleep. Anyway, I moved into a new apartment w new roommates last month and it’s one of the only spaces I’ve been in that I have not purged, so I’m gonna keep it that way. I’m just so proud of myself and for anyone who is currently struggling and feels like it will never end, I am here to tell you that it IS POSSIBLE. 7 years with this sad disorder and I finally feel a little bit free. Now, that being said, I have many other food-related issues that I will have to work on, but I’ve even been able to stop restricting and exercising so much. My weight has not really changed, which in the back of my mind I always knew would be the case because of the amount of calories that I was still absorbing when I would b/p.

I physically feel like I’m dying sometimes after a violent purge or painful binge. The next day, my body feels utterly exhausted. My throat is sore. My face is painfully swollen. My neck aches from the angle of bending over the toilet. My hands look ugly and scarred (not hands free). Occasionally, I’ll even come down with a fever and chills after a horrible BP session.  It just sucks. And I have nothing to show for it. I don’t have the body I want and my mental state is worse than ever. \n\nAt least with anorexia, I didn’t have to torture myself in such a violent way-it was more the choice to NOT do something (eat) than to actively choose harm behaviors (binge/purge).

I’m trying my hardest to be there for him. I’m learning to not speak of anything regarding weight. I realize that it’s triggering for him. Although I’m on a weight loss journey, I feel that I’m making things worse for my partner. A year ago he told me that after he eats, he has the urge to vomit. He feels disgusting with himself whenever he eats. He usually feels the urge to do it the most whenever he feels bloated, but I’ve come to realize he does it because he has this urge to eat 24/7. He’ll have these cravings and after he finishes, he’ll disappear to the bathroom. Prior to him telling me what he was doing, I assumed he was sick. I wanted to get him tested to make sure everything was okay. I guess after our trip to Colorado he decided to tell me because I became to super anxious about his health. He vomited several times during our vacation in Colorado. Now that he’s told me about the issue, I remember he would do this after we ate out, and I feel horrible about it. A moment when he was supposed to be enjoying himself, he was beating himself up mentally. The whole time he’s been suffering mentally with a vicious cycle. Fast forward to now, he feels super comfortable doing it every time after he eats. I researched ways to communicate with him about it, but I’m nervous I’ll trigger him and I’ll make it worse. I really want him to be happy with himself mentally and physically, but watching him go through this is heartbreaking. He does it every day, after every meal. After he does this, he weighs himself and I hate it. I’ve tried hiding the scale, but he’ll blame it on my own personal issues. I don’t agree with scales because it sets unrealistic expectations for people that suffer with body dysmorphia. How do I tell him he’s killing himself mentally and physically? I’v tried setting up appointments for him for therapy, I’ve tried cooking healthy meals and not addressing them as “healthy” so he won’t fixate or beat himself up for not eating healthy. I’ve tried talking to him about how it makes me feels and he promises he’ll stop, but I feel like it’s getting out of control. Sometimes I cry or panic when I hear him doing it. One of our children likes to weigh himself now because he sees him doing it so often. I’m just completely exhausted from him hurting himself. I don’t wanna wake up and he’s not here. I don’t wanna lose him. Does anyone know how I can convince him to take his health serious?

My niece is 15 years old and has recently been diagnosed as neurodiverse. She has also recently developed anorexia. To give you some background, it was noticeable from a very young age that she was very into food, not that there is anything wrong with that, but she often over ate and also ate a lot of unhealthy stuff. My sister (her mum) has always been super careful not to place too much emphasis on food, dieting, appearance etc as we grew up in a household that did. To cut a long story short I developed anorexia at the age of 14 which evolved into bulimia at the age of 16 which I have only recovered from in the last few years. I am now 52. In reaction to my ed as a teenager, my sister also developed bulimia which she recovered from within a few years. Our own struggles have never been talked about openly in the family as the last thing we wanted was for history to repeat itself. My bulimia has always been hidden behind closed doors and my nieces have never have known about it, as to all intents and purposes things have been a lot better in the last several years and I am now recovered. To fast forward as my niece has entered her teens where outward appearance suddenly becomes a lot more important, she has started restricting. First by cutting down on meal sizes, but still eating snack stuff  in between meals, then she became a vegetarian and now she will only eat porridge and fruit, although my sister told me yesterday she doesn't even want to eat porridge anymore. She's lost an alarming amount of weight. We are all incredibly worried as you can imagine so my question is what do we do? She is currently getting counselling regarding her struggles being neuro diverse, but this therapist isn't an eating disorder specialist. She won't talk about it or admit there is a problem. I am going to stay there in a couple of weeks and would like to try and talk to her about it. Will it help to share my own struggles with her do you think? She really looks up to me and idolises me and the last thing I want is for this to backfire - ie if my auntie had it then I'm in good company type of thing. I would hate for her to go through what I have gone through for so many years though.  My sister is at her wits end and is struggling to hold it together - her and her husband both have demanding jobs. Some advice would really be welcome.

I just find peace in food and I kinda can't figure out why. I think it may be due to the fact that my mom after every outburst of anger, arguments about nothing (she is very very toxic that's why I moved out) wasn't apologizing, but was giving me food and was really caring and loving for a little while, but that's just a mask for me. \nI have diagnosed by psychiatrist mixed personality disorder, affective mood disorder and mixed ED.

My dad went on a 'health kick' when I was 13 & took me along for the ride too. This was stuff like intermittent fasting, the Keto diet, generally demonising certain foods for being 'unhealthy' & becoming rather preoccupied with weight. I also unfortunately picked up his habbit of late night binging on these forebidden foods. The 'fasting' got to the point where I wouldn't eat until after school (like 4pm) & then only eat one meal day ... the amount I would eat in those meals must have been horrifying to watch. I gained weight, which was probably inevitable given my eating patterns. My dad would always comment on how greedy I was, & I even remember him telling my boyfriend's parents that I was 'such a greedy porker' ... I was so ashamed.\n\nThen COVID hit & family relations became really tense, so I turned to food as the one thing I could control absolutely in my life. Is it terrible that it almost felt so good? I finally looked 'pretty' & felt like I had gained control, a degree of separation from my father that eat so much, like I used to? I loved the idea of being so skinny (I'm a 21f at 178cm & weighed 55kg at my lightest) even though I could barely function mentally & was starting to struggle physically with fainting & fatigue. All the compliments I received didn't help.\n\nThen my family relationships took a turn for the worse, &it suddenly rebounded & I just couldn't stop eating food... I had never binged so savagely like that before. Just eating for the sake of eating. I put so much weight on from binging in a short time frame that my skin stretched & itched & snapped, almost. I gave myself stretch marks from these binges, all over my body... my thighs, my bum, my calves, my biceps & a long scar along my abdomen, almost as if from a c-section. I'm not sure I could ever love my body because of them; I can only hope to one day to feel neutral about them. They just feel like reminders of my vices & struggles. That I can never be 'conventionally pretty.' I felt so awful from these binges, physically & mentally. But I couldn't stop... whenever something negative happened, it felt like a compulsion to react like this, finding a sick sort of comfort from  the off-limit foods I'd never usually have, now always associated with these episodes.\n\nMy stomach would hurt so badly from the amount I stuffed into, I couldn't sleep from the amount of heat & sweat I produced from these sessions. Then I realised that I could just empty my stomach & that could be better. I didn't need to fear about the excess calories & what they would do to my body, & could still binge when I felt my emotions tip sideways. I'd only do it once, or twice, or three times, or four times...\n\nWhat a joke. I am controlled by this disorder, this illness of the mind. It doesn't even work - I've put weight on & my mind & body are constantly against me. I feel like an addict when the urger to binge & purge comes, constantly jittering & flittering about. My throat is so sore. My bowel movements are so unpredictable & extreme. It's made me a liar & it's financially burdensome, so materially  wasteful. I hate lurking in the ktichen & spitting out a chewed cookie, only to find myself hunched over the toilet later. I'm so tired of what my life has become, of the relationships & opportunities it's sabotaging, of the husk it's made me. \n\nI want to recover. I want to enjoy life. I don't want to constantally aganoise over the the slight wobble of flesh on my thighs & the way my trousers brush against my skin, the calories contained in watermelon, a WATERMELON, for god's sake! I want to be me again. I want to love life & my loved ones. Have a cookie, if I fancy it. Find balance.\n\nIt's a daunting thought, because I know it's going to take time, & effort & sweat & blood & tears, but nothing worth it in life is easy. Only one person can take take that step to make it better, & it has to be me.\n\nI'm going to see a therapist/consellor for the first time this week.

I have no ulterior reason, I just feel the need to do it. It's my vice, my dirty secret, my leisure, my safe space, my comfort, whatever.

My  parents love to travel and eat good food and when I was young I was the  same way. When I came out to my parents at 14, they were extremely  accepting but still their love didn't feel enough to me. I wanted a  boyfriend BADLY, but I didn't know why until I came to a slow  realisation today.\n\nAs an only  child, my parents had been extremely strict on me, including which apps I  was allowed to download until a few weeks ago. My phone had a setting  that everytime I tried to download an app, it had to be approved by my  dad (It wasn’t as bad as it sounds).\n\nSo  having all those rules, for my freshman year of highschool I was  boarding (AKA without my parents supervision) meaning I had my phone  attached to me. This was the first time ever that I was allowed to have  my phone in the same room that I slept in (another rule at my parents  house: no electronics in the bedroom). I also discovered the website  Omegle, and I was hooked. I started talking to gay people from around  the world while staying anonymous. Only the ones I thought I had a  connection with I would give them my snap. This is where the detail  about food I gave kicks in. I was a chubby 14 year old with some face  fat. Many people did not like that, so after I would send them a face  pic, they would typically block me. Yeah, it kinda hurt but what was  worse was the people who decided to send me a detailed paragraph on how I  was a fat f-. Multiple people told me if I wanted to find a boyfriend,  or to be their boyfriend I had to lose at least 15lbs. I was upset but I  didn’t do much action until COVID hit. The winter of 2019, I became  extremely good friends with a guy—who lived in a different  continent—from Omegle who was the same age as me. Everything was great  but he kept hinting on how he wanted to go to the gym, and I think it  was a harmless way for him to hint to me that I needed to lose weight,  it might have not been but that is the way I took it and still do. I  will never know because long story short he blocked me. I was  heartbroken, what I thought of as my best friend had cut me off within  seconds.\n\nWhen the lockdown  started, I took a hard look at myself in the mirror and knew I had to  make a change, so I started eating healthier, hydrated myself better,  and exercised more. It was all healthy habits and after a year I had  lost 17lbs. I was proud but still something inside me believed I wasn’t  good enough. December 31st 2020 was the first day I purged. At first I  was in so much pain for wasting food and thought of the people who  worked hard to prepare the food and was filled with guilt, but after  weighing myself and seeing how much weight I have lost, the guilt  flushed away. After 6 months of throwing up after each meal, I lost  15lbs. I got to the high 150’s range. Still I was unhappy and I started  counting calories, started doing juice cleanses every week, anything to  just make my calorie count lower. From there, I lost another 10lbs and  now I am in the mid 140’s. Although Google tells me I’m still on the  heavier scale, I don’t think I have enough fat to keep purging away, the  energy or even the motivation. Yes, losing weight does make me happy  but I can’t deny that I’m not miserable. Is being .6lbs lighter than  yesterday worth all of my effort? Now I’m seriously questioning my  morals.\n\nAfter this deep reflection  with my weight I knew why I wanted a boyfriend so badly and why I was  abusing my health for a fantasy. I come from a small family, no cousins,  no siblings, just me as the youngest generation. When I’m older and all  the ones I love leave this world, who am I going to love that can  reciprocate those feelings to me? If the people from omegle were right  and all I have to do is to lose some weight, then it would be an easy  sacrifice to make. But they’re not, I may have lost a lot of weight  where I’m always at the edge of passing out, still single and even more  broken than I was before. I’ve been hesitant to say this but it’s time  to confess. I need to help, I need to work on myself, I don’t want  somebody to love me because of my weight, I want them to take me for the  way I am, I want to be able to love myself for the way I am."}, {'Disordered': 'To the people who told someone about their struggle.

Bulimia wires your brain to get stuck in an endless cycle. You are chained by it. A prisoner. A prisoner to your brain, the routine, the crutch, the reward system, the very wiring of your brain you\'ve trained yourself to be entrenched in. The only CURE is to rewire your brain. You have to MAKE yourself not purge. You have to break the cycle. You overeat. You stop eating. You don\'t purge. You wallow and despair in the awful feeling it triggers to deny yourself the relief, to resist the urge. Now you must do it a dozen, one hundred, one thousand times. It gets easier the more you do it, the more discomfort you face. The discomfort magically melts away with time. I used manifestation to help me resist the urges and bad thoughts, to help rewire my brain. It does take self-control, it does take WORK but we are limitless beings and you can truly accomplish it. Anyone can. The law of assumption is what I used specifically. Because it is essentially deluding/tricking your brain, it helps you rewire it with much more ease, much more complacency. Here is a passage to sum up law of assumption:   \n"**Daring To Assume That All Things Are Possible To Imagine, Put This One Reality To The Extreme Test By Assuming You Are The Person You Would Like To Be. Your Reasonable Mind And Outer Senses May Deny It; But I Promise You: If You Will Persist, You Will Receive Your Assumption."**  \n\n\nPersist in your assumption that you are recovered, that you do not have those urges. That you never want to binge or purge again. If you mess up, do it again, test yourself if you can go longer and longer without purging. Live in the delusion, in the assumption you are cured, and it will harden into fact. Once you go without doing it for three weeks, it becomes so much freaking easier. For me it\'s been over 2 months and I can honestly say I don\'t think I\'ll ever feel compelled enough to do it again, and during those 2 months I had several stressful emotional situations where in the past, I would have easily capitulated.\n\nDo you want to die a bulimic, stay bulimic, or are you willing to confront your discomfort and claim a better life, a life which you deserve and can have?'}, {'Disordered': "Drugs or medicines that worked for you?

Tw anorexia  What should I do?\n\nBackground information: I’m 15F and last year I suffered from anorexia. Idk if this is what is affecting me but I have been diagnosed with adhd, depression, and OCD. My depression has got much better over this past year. When I was a kid, I have this memory that sticks in my head of my dad coming into my room grabbing my stomach(not in a forceful way) and saying I was a pig. Sometimes he calls me fat or when I stress eat, he says “oh, you’re going to eat all of THAT?” And I think since I have adhd, all of this stuff resonates inside my head, like every time I walk past him it’s all I can think about. However, to most people Im not considered overweight, and always have been under the average weight for my age and height, but I would think about it so much that I would hate myself every time I look in the mirror and be disgusted when myself when I did eat. My mom says that my dad was overweight when he was a kid, and his parents did the same thing to him and that he doesn’t know any better. My dad really cares for me and I know he doesn’t mean to do it and that he’s still working on himself, but Im still extremely insecure about myself. \n\nLast year, It was to the point where I would just not eat and sometimes I would faint, and I almost cracked my skull open because I fainted fell on the floor head first (which hurt for like a few mins but I’m very grateful to not have needed to have gone to the hospital).

Much like other mental health illnesses. I\'m tired of everyone saying I "should have grown out of anorexia". It started at age 13 and I\'m now 30. Still anorexic. It\'s not a teen phase. It\'s a lifelong illness. I don\'t know why mostly teens have it or had it and tell me it magically disappeared. It\'s manageable but not curable and you cannot recover from a mental condition. Mental health is for life. Much like my OCD and BPD and other illnesses. But as I said, it\'s manageable with alot of hard work on a daily to keep it at bay to a lessor degree, depending on the person.  But it is not something you recover from. You may gain weight as a external symptom perspective, but your mind will always have this disorders irrational pattern of how you see food and your body etc. I\'m not trying to be a downer, I just think we need to cut ourselves some slack and realize that completely diminishing something is not possible. But that\'s okay!

And the day after that, and so on. Because it’s always just ‘one last binge’. This wasn’t going to be my last, it was just going to send me deeper and deeper into the hole. \n\nSo I turned off the oven, took the half-cooked pizza out, and threw it all away. I know that’s wasteful, but I had nobody to give it to and I didn’t want the binge food to tempt me. \n\nIf I had binged as planned, I’ve calculated I would’ve consumed >!11550 calories!<.

If it helps anyone about 5 months ago I started doing this thing where I stopped eating alone. If I get hungry I will ask a some one to join me. I'll meet anyone anywhere, I'll have someone come over to my place or go over to theirs. I found This helps keep my eating senceable in 2 ways. The first way is If I'm eating alone I'd order a 12-pack of tacos, 2 quesadillas and a CRS at Tacobell then feel like shit about it. With some one around a single meal will do. The second way is after the meal I'm not alone. I can't just run off and blow chunks. Usually after the meal their is something planned or we'll sit around talking for a bit giving the meal time to digest. Maybe this is something that can help some of you. I hope it helps. How is everyone coping? I really want to know. This thing, bulimia interrupts logical thought. You only focus on feeding the urge and seeking relief.

I\'ll eat the whole thing, so I can\'t have more later, & then puke it. I\'m not totally sure labelling it with "orthorexic tendencies" is the best or most responsible descriptor but that\'s what I see fit for now.\n\nIt started a little over a year ago in February of 2021 when when I weighed myself and was like 208 lb. I had thrown up before maybe a couple times here & there since I was about 13. But this past year is when the disorder really kicked off and it became a habitual thing that I realized was effective. At first I threw up anything without categorizing it is good or bad and deciding what I don\'t want to metabolize. But when my hair started thinning out, I focused a lot on nutrition and eating the right foods. So I started taking vitamins and then I let myself keep down nutrient dense meals. & Id only get rid of the bad things. Over time, I started to just be repulsed by the idea of eating anything bad altogether. So I didn\'t have to purge as much. But as EDs tend to, it got worse & around March of this year, I started to have the urge to get rid of the good foods too if I thought I was eating too many calories to still lose weight. Since then I have tried to recover but I think I fully relapsed. I gained 10 pounds while in recovery and now I\'m back to purging bad foods and only taking good foods and I\'m trying to restrict the calories of the good food that I take in so I can still lose. & I\'m slowly getting back to being disgusted by "unhealthy" things. & Having an easier time not eating them. Which is good. But I don\'t want to get to a point where I feel like I need to purge the good food. The food that actually benefits my body. Which is why I\'m restricting the calories of it. I now weigh about 145. In season 2 of my bulimia, I\'ve graduated from vomiting to also using laxatives but I try to use those sparingly as to not develop a tolerance & to avoid any intense electrolyte depletion. This is hell. & I\'m so tired. I just want to be normal. & I know where this all stems from. I know why it started to begin with but I can\'t dismantle it now. & I can\'t just recover & let myself gain weight either. So much of my self worth has been tied to how pretty & fuckable I can make myself. That\'s mostly a result of a physically, psychologically, & sexually abusive relationship I had been in for the past two years, along with other things. I won\'t go into detail of what specific events caused which specific behaviors & the thought process behind them. That\'s a lot to unpack.\n\nI tell myself that once I hit the certain number, I can just eat to maintain. But I know that eating disorders are brutal & don\'t work that way. I know that I\'ll just aim lower. I\'ve already started to set lower goal weights before even hitting the original. & If I\'m being totally honest I don\'t see an end to this. I try to imagine what it\'d be like to be okay with my body & its fluctuations that are bound to come throughout life. But that sounds impossible. I don\'t know how I can ever balance a healthy awareness of what I put into my body & my energy expenditure. & I\'m scared. I don\'t trust myself to  balance enough to not gain or not fall into disordered patterns once I do decide to recover.

So quick backstory, my parents abused me growing up, I coped by eating myself sick. Literally. Food was far more a comfort than a necessity. When I was small, my parents had a side by side fridge, and they padlocked it as well as the pantry, so I couldn’t wake up at 1 am and sneak food. I recall one evening in particular, one I’ll NEVER forget: I was MAYBE 10. We went to a Lion’s Club fish fry fundraiser because our landlord was in the Lions and got us tickets every time they did their quarterly fry, and I had been fighting with my parents all day. We sat at the table, and they kept coming around to top off our pieces of fish, potatoes, etc (it was AYCE) and I literally ate until my body couldn’t take it anymore, and threw it all back up, all across the table. It was mortifying, even more so because it was binge eating, something that I felt was entirely out of my control, something that they warn us against when they discuss bulimia and anorexia in health class. I never put it together until five years ago when I got help for an opiate addiction—not only was I addicted to eating, I was over 400 pounds and pre-diabetic.\n\nFast forward. My relationship with food has significantly changed, thanks to outpatient rehab for drugs.  The coping mechanisms are the same. Now, I eat when I’m hungry, I eat sweets if I’m craving them, I drink sodas when I want them, but I often don’t. Sugary soda is TOO sugary now. And I’m not eating an entire box of snack cakes in one go. I’m mindful of what I eat, I stopped chugging mt dew and switched to Diet Coke and liquid Death sparkling water (because I hate flat water with a fuckin passion,) AND I fast intermittently. Those THREE changes, being mindful, cutting sugar in pop and being more hydrated, as well as not eating for certain hours of the day, have been a turning point for me. I have a long way to go, and I know that even though I’ll struggle, I WILL continue to lose weight. \n\nHowever. I live with my parents; my dad is disabled and needs a live-in to get by. My dad is “concerned,” because I “eat too much,” when in actuality, a, he has no idea what I’m eating or how much unless I directly tell him, and b, he’s one to talk. He’s an insulin dependent diabetic, but I keep my mouth shut about his addiction to sweets, because it’s none of my business. Today, I had a paper plate with six strawberries and a piece of roast beef lunch meat, and an avocado in a bowl with some salt. (Bc I don’t like my foods to touch. The avocado had a weird texture so I didn’t eat more than half of it. I ate half the meat and all of the strawberries. And then I waited for half an hour. I was still hungry so I decided to make popcorn. At which BOTH of my parents piped up and my dad asked if I had ever considered keeping a food journal… Yes dad, I did that. I kinda got really irritated with him for that. He SAID it’s because he’s concerned about me, but he also has a lot of control issues, and I’m not totally convinced it has nothing to do with that.\n\nI want to educate them about binge eating/bulimia, as well as educate them on how much better I am… but I have never really had to have this conversation.

So, to start out, I didn\'t always have an unhealthy relationship with food. Growing up, my mother, while abusive, was an excellent cook. Plus, growing up in a family of all big eaters, I learned to love food pretty early on. I always had a big appetite, but was one of those (like my family) who have that lovely genetic blessing that allows them to eat and eat and eat and eat and never gain an ounce. Unfortunately, I developed a condition called PCOS around the age of 12 that caused me to blow up like a literal balloon (put on 50 pounds in 2 months at 5 feet tall). Even more unfortunately, this went undiagnosed for a decade- I only recently found out about it. Mom instantly started picking on me and saying it was because how much I was eating, which started my inevitable downward spiral into eating disorders, depression, body image issues, etc. I couldn\'t just learn to stop loving food, with food being one of the only positive things I can associate my mom with during my childhood- so naturally I\'m an extremely emotional eater. Doesn\'t matter what the emotion is, it makes me want to eat. Its like it\'s just hardwired into my brain as some kind of weird coping mechanism.\n\n   Over the years, I packed on quite a few more pounds. It wasn\'t until I hit 200lb that I finally said enough is enough and started doing research about it. Weeks of research and several doctors visits later, and I finally got diagnosed with my condition. At that point, I had the tools and knowledge I needed to finally be able to lose weight. I was successful for the first 60lb- and I actually did it in a healthy way!! I started eating less processed food, working out regularly, managing portion control, etc etc. It\'s been working up until a couple weeks ago. Suddenly all my previous food urges came back to me and I feel like I can\'t control myself anymore. I tell myself "I just ate- I\'m not hungry, I\'m already full." And then my body just goes on autopilot and I eat more anyway, which of course leads to me binging and purging again for the first time this year. I was doing so good, but now I\'m starting to gain the weight back again (only 5lbs so far) and I just feel such a loss of control. As a recovering alcoholic, I can confidently say that these food cravings are just as bad, if not worse, than alcohol cravings. I used to pour bottles down the sink to keep myself from it- but I\'ve never thrown food out, or even given it away. I just can\'t. Its like I\'m falling off the bandwagon again but this time with food instead of alcohol. \n\n   I guess that I just didn\'t realize until now that I\'m going to have to fix my relationship with food if I want to lose weight and keep it off. I guess I just got so excited when I finally understood what was going on with my body that I didn\'t even take my food relationship into consideration until it started rearing it\'s ugly head again. I can do all the right things at all the right times, but eventually I\'m going to squander all the results I\'m seeing with my binging unless I get control of it, and since my weight was the initial cause of the eating disorder, it lands me right back in that vicious cycle of loving food and hating my body that I lost my teenage years to. So if anyone has any suggestions on how to fix this, I would greatly appreciate it. I don\'t even know where to start. Do I train myself to stop enjoying food so much? If I try to teach myself the "just eat when you\'re hungry" rule, I just end up binging and purging again. I tried googling, but only came up with the same lame, generic stuff my therapist told me. I\'m sure that stuff works for some people, but it never worked for me.

Like not really restricting but just eating “safely” but also eating little random snacks here and there. I rarely cook meals without tracking them and weighing them (because Thats what helps to keep me from wanting to purge) but for the past few days I’ve been able to kind of just eat whatever my work or family makes and estimate the cals. Also, My work really has been helping simply because they make us meals and I even look forward to being “forced” to eat what they make us. Not actually forced, but it’s made specifically for us to eat and everyone eats it so I feel okay when everyone else is, even though it’s always “comfort” foods like lasagna, alfredo, Mac and cheese, etc., but it feels freeing I guess. \n\nAnyway that was kind of me rambling.

This morning I said that I felt better (due to the fact that I looked reaaaally skinny), but then at the party I was eating wings and Mac and cheese, baked beans, etc., which still did not bother me, until out of nowhere my brain told me to take a plate to-go so I could binge on it a little. So I did, and then I went to the store and got some dessert. Anyway, I ate the food, and like a pint of ice cream, a taco I had leftover, and one cookie.

I almost didn’t even want to purge because I’m at the point where I’m realizing that binging and purging makes me gain weight but eating normal amounts of whatever I want and carrying on does not.

So, as always, i’m in my routine when my sister wants to go shopping with our then nanny (long story). she wants to go to TJ Maxx. i’m sitting on the couch while on my phone eavesdropping on the conversation and pipped up. “can i come? i need more clothes.” which was so desperately true considering i was a growing teen whose clothes always shrunk in the wash. i was living on the same two outfits for that whole summer. so, we’re getting ready to leave when i ask how long they thought this was going to take. my oblivious nanny replied “an hour, maybe two”. now, this was incredibly risky and lord knowssss i knew it too. i remember myself literally calculating how the time frame would work like “okay if i speed up my sister’s shopping by 30 min and i just grab one or two things bla blah blah” by this point in the day i was a horrid number of laxatives in. so the three of us get in the car and take the 7-10 minute drive to TJ Maxx. we pull up and i could feel my stomach lurch because of the physical movement of WALKING. i immediately knew i was in trouble because that lurch is what i felt when the laxative started to kick in. i didnt even make it to the first aisle until my stomach started it’s inner battle with my intestines. i thought it was just a really bad stomach ache. because the laxatives had never done this to me before. i looked around for a bathroom, to no avail. nothing. i told my nanny i wasn’t feeling good and was going to hang out in the car until they were done. as i was waking in the parking lot, out of NOWHERE, i could feel liquid shit trying to push its way out of me. this startled me and almost made me shit my pants, and so i froze for a moment to use all of my remaining willpower to clench the hardest i had ever clenched up until that point. i am truly amazed how i didn’t shit right then and there, i book it to the car and by this point i am sweating bullets, like full on whole body sweating trying to resist the urge to shit. i think i almost started crying. i got into the car and fidgeted for what felt like an hour to situate myself in a position where i wouldn’t immediately implode on myself. i was in a dire state of stress and anxiety and was frantic. i screamed at my phone “HEY SIRI CALL NANNY.” of course, the stupid AI didn’t know if i said if i wanted sushi or a massage. i once again screamed “SIRI CALL NANNY” “im sorry-“ “AGGHHHGGG” this was like pure agony. i opened my phone to find my nanny’s number. it was super difficult because i was shaking like a leaf. i called her and SHE DIDNT PICK UP. I was about to scream. i called her again and she picked up on about the fourth ring. now i don’t remember my exact conversation with her but i think it went something like “Nanny i’m gonna shit myself” “what?” “Nanny i’m gonna shit myself please get out here now asap now NOW” she said okay and hung up. no hi or bye. just extreme urgency. now for the wait. and oh my god. she took a total of 5 minutes aka an ETERNITY to get out to the car. when they got into the car my sister looked wildly concerned and we drove. the nearest bathroom was the Jack-in-the-Box across the street. we get to it’s parking lot and i stroll up acting as if i wasn’t holding back fucking boulders with my ass cheeks. i tried to open the door. locked. . . . im gonna die today. turns out it was closed for renovation. i sprinted back to the car. the new nearest bathroom was back at home. as we started driving i remember saying to my nanny “if i shit in your car, i’m so sorry” after 7 minutes of hell, miraculously, we made it home without my shitting myself. i ejected myself out of the car before it even stopped moving and once again made a run for my life to nearest bathroom in my home. i sat down and a wave of relief came over me, that i could kept part of my dignity. i then exploded. violently. i literally braced myself with the bathroom walls. so violent the toilet water was splashing at my bare ass. i was shitting for i think 30 minutes. but alas, no casualties, minus the toilet that had just been obliterated. i stepped out of my bathroom feeling somewhat accomplished. proud of myself and my willpower. and the immediately magnetized myself right back to that same toilet for the aftershock of the laxative.\nanyways, that’s the story. this was very long i know.

I stopped taking my meds around a year ago because of the side effects of potential weight gain, and have been lying to my doctor and family members for that long. I get around 3-4 hours of sleep a night, and systematically wake up throughout due to hunger pangs.\n\nI live in complete squalor, have stolen from grocery stores, collect coins from the side of the road and am barely able to make rent due to the bulk of my salary going towards food. The last purchase I made for myself was a $3 phone case, which I regretted because I thought that money could go to a box of cookies instead. Somehow I manage to maintain a job, but literally feel like a zombie the entire time due to weakness. I have been doing this for a year now (1 year anniversary last week), and since my parents are moving away on the 17th of august, my current plan of action is to jump off a bridge.\n\nThis life is not worth living.'}, {'Disordered': "safe food  Do any of you keep a list of what food is safe to eat?

A little background info: I'm 32 and have been diagnosed with BN since I was about 24. I am mostly in recovery, with some small slips here and there. I tend to take a harm reduction approach with my recovery and avoid trying to follow a super specific meal plan, trying to do things perfectly, etc. I lean more toward intuitive eating and that has worked out really well for me.\n\nThat said, I have struggled with eating during the day for quite a few years. It has slowly gotten better, but I still really struggle with breakfast. I used to be primarily BED and just compulsively overeating... I didn't start other behaviors until my early-mid 20s. When I first started restrictive and compensatory behaviors, I was also trying out keto type diets. That led me to intermittent fasting, and boy did I latch onto that one lol. That and low carb were my first true diet obsessions, and I engaged in those behaviors for a while before starting to purge more regularly. I was essentially binging at night and purging by fasting the next day. Eventually it got so bad that I was BPing multiple times daily. Miserable.\n\nFast forward to today after inpatient, therapy, meds, DBT, EMDR, nutritionists, so much therapy lol. Still doing therapy biweekly. Still on meds. I'm doing pretty well. My partner and I used to work similar hours, and we got to eat dinner together. So even if I struggled eating a bit during the day, I at least always got a really solid dinner and never purged it.\n\nWelp, now he's working until 10pm or so, and I'm working mostly 8am shifts. I'm feeling some... habits begin to pop back up. Today I went grocery shopping and bought a lot of ready to eat stuff so I don't have to worry so much about cooking after work, and I straight up bought several safe foods as well without really thinking about it. I purged once a few nights ago and felt super gross about it. There's just so much alone time.\n\nI mentioned my concerns to my best friend, and she said she feels confident that I won't sink back into it because I'm aware of it. We both have some form of disordered eating, hers more ARFED type stuff. We also both have bipolar 2 and anxiety. She kind of understands in a way, but the pull to lose weight isn't there for her. She's actually self conscious of how thin she is. So she doesn't quite understand that my ED is fucking insidious and wants to trick me. It wants me to be complacent and fall into old habits.\n\nShe has a point- I feel exhausted thinking about doing things the way I used to do back in my worst days. The fact that I've mentioned it in therapy, to a close friend, and am posting here says that I don't truly want to relapse. But I also am really suffering with my body image lately, and being alone more often, thus being able to micromanage my intake and skip meals, is not helping one bit.\n\nEh, I guess that's it really. I just.. needed to say it to people who would understand. I don't wanna relapse. I'm scared. But I feel myself sooooo ready to hide everything again and dive right back in. Stupid ass illness.

I still feel like I can’t quite admit that it’s a real problem for me, except that I’ve developed a paranoia about my teeth and now brush a bit too much. \n\nI’ve been going to the gym recently, I don’t hate it when I’m there but its hard to motivate myself to actually go.

I spent almost 30 minutes looking at all the the things I could buy and maybe just eat a little bit of instead of bingeing on. I felt like a crazy person in there, just wandering the aisles, salivating, dreaming of bingeing on everything.\n\nBut in the end, I bought a banana and cottage cheese and went home & put some vanilla & cinnamon in it for a sweet snack. It was good. But honestly I can’t even feel proud of myself because I’m still hungry AF and want to binge. Ugh.\n\nThis is so freaking hard. I’ve had urges to binge eat since I was a pre-teen….now 31. I wonder if they’ll ever go away or if my brain is just wired like this for life 😩'}, {'Disordered': "New to this Community  I'm just going to put it out there...

One night, I dropped her off at her house and after weighing herself, she would have p\\*rged if her mom was not constantly asking her questions through the bathroom door. Shortly after that, my parents took us to get ice cream and after asking her multiple times if she had room for it in her calorie restrictions and offering to share whatever she wanted to, she had an urge to p\\*rge. The good part is that I was with her, so I literally had to hold her hands back and stop her from doing anything. This is the moment where I realized that this was still very much in her head regardless of our recovery.\n\nTonight was no different than the other experiences shared. We ate our last meal around 6 and at 12 our friends took us to McDonalds and after eating not even a full container of fries, she ran to the McDonalds bathroom (without telling me or anyone else) and started attempting to forcing a purge. If I hadn't have noticed that she was in the bathroom and sent one of our female friends in there, she would have totally p\\*rged. \n\nI have told her many times that this is a problem that I want to go through together, and it hurts me to a level that no one will understand when she B/P (especially that night where I had to forcibly hold her back for around an hour and a half), and she knows that too. \n\nIs there any recommendations that you guys have for recovery? It seems like she doesn't actually believe that it's a problem because its the 'first time in a while' but I know how relapses work and I know it will go right back to where we started if a relapse happens. She used to text me and ask for help and I would drop everything I was doing (often even texting her while driving home, or dropping everything I'm doing to go to her house and spend time with her) which seemed to help her a lot in her initial recovery journey.

(ive noticed a pattern of becoming so interested in one thing, putting all my energy into it, then it fades and bores me greatly) december/january was my peak in loving gym because i knew heaps about it now. i considered myself fully recovered from ed. i didn’t think about calories, i stopped counting them. i ate enough and guilt-free, there was just no ed in my brain.   \n\nmaybe around march/april i stopped being consistent bc i started losing motivation and love for gymming. it was just boring and repetitive. and bc now i was positive and ed-free, i did not force myself to gym if i didn’t want to. \n\nsince the start of this year, i’ve had phases of having no appetite. eg id lose my appetite for a few days, it comes back for 2 weeks. and the cycle repeats. but i just forced myself to eat anyway. i did not even consider it to be ed-related i just thought it may be stress or something. \n\ntoday, i’ve had no appetite for like 10 days so i go on a google search and all the causes of loss of appetite don’t seem to match me. so i have a dig into my thoughts and i realise that recently i’ve purposefully used this to not eat and i haven’t forced myself to eat like usual. and i tracked it back, 11 days ago i zoned out eating cheesecake and thought about the calories in it and kind of freaked out but i still ate it and felt fine after. so that probably triggered this appetite loss. i’ve realised i lose my appetite whenever i have an overly filling meal. \n\ni used love food, but now, i could not give less fucks about it. i don’t enjoy it, eating feels like a chore. and too many foods seem unappetising. even when i find something i feel like eating, when i do, i realise it was overhyped in my mind. I JUST CANT BE BOTHERED TO EAT. \n\ni caught myself thinking what if i just relapse it’ll be so much easier this time. and i’m physically hungry but just not eating bc “might as well lose weight while i don’t feel like eating”. and right now, i have no obsession as i am bored of the gym. my mind is so confused. \n\nwhy am i losing my appetite whenever i feel fullness? how do i like food again? am i relapsing? is the appetite loss my fault? why do i need an obsession?'}, {'Disordered': 'How can I help?

I never thought I would have developed an ED, but my body dysmorphia really took a hold of me and slowly I started to purge, even after eating healthier meals of rice/chicken/veggie bowls. After a while, I started to purge multiple times/day. When I came back to college for sophomore year, so many people were telling me how great I looked and it was nice hearing the affirmations of the “work” I was putting into my body.

I cannot explain the frequent bathroom trips, vomiting my lunch and dinner with snot coming out of my nose, hurt teeth and fingers, chubby cheeks, the twitches while purging, the stomach pain, the tiktok sounds of pretty women dancing playing over and over on loop because I forgot to turn my phone off while I purged, and worst of all the smile that it put on my face. Then, I discovered laxatives - this is my biggest problem. I have yet to find a bulimic who purges like I do. It began with 3 every day, then 5, now 15+ every single night. With extreme pai, gastritis and stomach ulcers - I have lied to everyone, no one knows, not my doctors or even my closest friend. I go through a 250 tablet C-lax pill bottle in less than a month.

The only time I’ve come close to recovery is when I was eating 1500 cals and lying to my care team and maintaining my weight but that was even more torturous since I had to calculate everything so perfectly 6 times a day instead of just not eating at all and binging at night. I know the logical thing to do is to go to inpatient but that was hell as well. They pump you full of carbs and sugar and dump you once you’re “recovered” despite being worse mentally.

This is my personal journey and one size doesn’t fit all but maybe one of these things could be helpful to someone.\n\nA little about me: I have had Bulimia for 15 years and restrictive eating for 2 years before that. I started my EDs when I was 11 and I am now about to be 29 years old. I grew up in a very abusive household and my way to cope with the trauma was through my EDs.\n\nI never saw professional help for my EDs but I will say that I started seeing a therapist for my anxiety and depression almost 2 years ago. And that’s what I wanted to highlight here today. Bulimia is a coping strategy. B/P is a way to deal with unresolved emotional trauma and for me, the breakthrough for my recovery was making the connection as to why I was doing what I was doing and then having someone acknowledge and validate my feelings. Once I started talking about my trauma and pain I was able to start coping strategies that were healthy for me.\n\nMy coping strategies that have helped me the most are:\n\n1. Journaling- helps gets whatever you’re feeling and thinking out of your head.\n2. Walking-30 minutes a day will help keep your mind and body healthy.\n3. Yoga- calm body movements matched to the rhythm of your breathing is incredibly relaxing and healing. Yoga with Adrienne is my go to.\n4. Support system- you need at least one person to lean on. I feel like my therapist is someone who I feel a lot of respect for and who I feel has my best interests at heart as well as my one good friend who also has my back. \n\nThe first 3 things are apart of my daily routine. And the 4th thing is a few times a week. \n\nTherapy is something that I thought wasn’t obtainable. I had a handful of bad experiences with potential therapists in the past that made me almost give up on the idea. But once you find someone that you like, it’s seriously life changing. My therapist is trained for AEDP therapy which is short for Accelerated Experimental Dynamic Psychotherapy. “It is talk therapy that aims to help people overcome trauma, loss or some other serious emotional challenges.” From google haha. \n\n\n\nThis is what I felt was the core of my recovery.

Ive struggled with it as long as i can remember. It usually occurs in infants, and children usually grown out of it. It took forever to get a diagnosis because it is unknown and i moved around a lot. (i’m gonna describe it for those who don’t know and it’s pretty gross so be warned) Pretty much after eating (usually within an after 1 hour or 2) i spit up or regurgitate the food i just ate. It is caused by involuntary muscle contractions. It is different than acid reflux. For me, it causes bad breath, occasional tooth problems, and heartburn. Its only cure is diaphragmatic breathing typically through behavioral therapy, but that is time consuming and expensive. It effects my eating disorder because it makes me want to purge more.

I absolutely love my mom, and i don’t think she realizes what she’s done. I actually started acting on my thoughts sometime in 2020 i think.

It’s scary because i see my younger sister struggling with restricting her food. i don’t want her to take after me, but she also constantly compares herself to my looks. Recently, ive gained about 10lbs which i’ve been insecure about, and i was really trying to lose it in a healthy way. However, i read a comic that dealt with pretty heavy and realistic eating disorder depictions. i should’ve listened to the trigger warnings, and just finished it another time. i’ve relapsed (started eating a lot less), and working out again. it’s honestly really scary.
