If you are eating enough, three meals a day with researched portions rather than just what you may think is enough, then you are recovering, no matter your outward appearance. When you go to the doctor, look away from the number on that scale,  you don't NEED to see it, your doctor will tell you if you are over or under what you should be. If you need too, cover sections of your mirrors that show parts of your body your not ready to accept yet. Tell yourself every day you look hot, gorgeous, beautiful, your body is amazing, etc. and as untrue and ridiculous as it may sound, you'll start to believe it. But more than anything, know that you can do it. Know that it's normal to be afraid if getting better. That it's ok to have to take a break in the middle of eating for a quick sob and coping method. It's normal to feel like your just faking it, even when everyone around you disagrees. Your going to get people who push back, say your illness isn't real or try to discredit the effort it will take to recover, people who attempt to glamorize anorexia, and even more, but all you have to do is say fuck them and hold on for dear life to the drive you have to recover, no matter how small it may seem.\n\nIf you ever need to talk, feel free to message me, and remember, you can do this."}, {'Disordered': 'For how long did you experience fatigue during your recovery?

In about a week it will be one year since her father (my uncle) passed from an OD.  \n\nEver since she was little she has been overweight, and around 9 years old her grandmother started commenting about it, saying horrible things. When we went to drop her off after taking her out to celebrate her birthday her grandmother declined to take the rest of my cousins birthday cake, claiming that “she is too fat” already. At dinner that night she wouldn’t eat. That was around 3 years ago, and we didn’t have a repeat incident since, but every time we have a family meal I have kept an eye on her to make sure she is eating because I know how slippery of a slope it can be. \n\nWell we saw her on Easter and she was pretty overweight, it was to a level that it was a bit concerning but of course no one made any rude comments or anything. I hadn’t seen her since, but I was supposed to see her today along with my sister and grandma but I ended up not going because I’m still in recovery from getting my wisdom teeth extracted. \n\nDuring the afternoon my sister calls me and tells me that my cousin is not okay. That she definitely has an eating disorder and she’s pretty sure it’s anorexia. \n\nShe explained how my cousin would talk about counting calories and how she would eat a couple pieces of shrimp in the morning then run miles on the treadmill to burn it off. She literally blacked out while at my grandmas. They talked to her grandmother who said that they know about her eating disorder and they have an appointment with urgent care tomorrow, and that they have taken her several times already. \n\nI ended up calling her to check up on her, but I just told her that I was calling since I didn’t get to see her earlier. I didn’t mention that I had talked to my sister or the blackout and when I asked her how it went she didn’t mention it either. She happened to be just down the street at the time so I decided to go out to meet her so I could see her. \n\nShe was. Stick. Thin. \n\nKeep in mind that I haven’t seen her since April, but just 4 months ago she was very overweight and now she has no fat on her whatsoever. I didn’t think it was even possible to lose that much weight in such a short time. \n\nShe explained to me how she eats a salad for breakfast and then runs on the treadmill right after to burn it off and how she is trying to stay away from sugar. I tried explaining to her that burning off the salad isn’t going to help her it’s only going to harm her because her body needs the nutrients to function properly. She seemed confused by that. I took her out for frozen yogurt and convinced her to get some. She ate it and I overheard her on the phone updating her aunt on where she was and they way she said “yeah we went to get froyo. Yeah I ate the whole thing!” And she sounded genuinely surprised with herself. \n\nMy sister and I really want to help her and are extremely concerned. She lives pretty close to me with her aunt so I am definitely going to go out of my way to spend more time with her.

We’re here to help each other ♥️ \n\nI don’t and have never gave a fuck as to what I’ve looked like. I can say confidently that my disorder is not because of a fear of gaining weight, but it is solely because of my anxiety and depression. Everyone always stereotypes restrictive anorexia as a body disorder, which it is, but my body “issues” were only a fuel to my obsession with control. It became an addiction, and I couldn’t stop. Not like I wanted to, anyway. The numbness from not eating distracted me from cutting and insomnia because as an anorexic, your focus is only on one thing— because that’s all your brain can manage. I’m not going to deny that I didn’t obsess over my body. I did. But there was no heart or meaning behind my thoughts— “you’re so fat” “your stomach is not flat enough” passed through my mind, but, were never in confidence. It was a reassurance that everything in my mind was doing better… it ultimately brought me peace.\nI felt so safe restricting. It was reliable, I could count on it. Because I was the one in control. It poisoned me and brainwashed me into thinking that all my other problems would fade away because of the fatigue it gave me that would not allow me to have any thoughts in general. Now, in recovery, I’m battling with the same depression and anxiety that I always had but at a much more intense rate— because of the toll that anorexia put on me. Not only do I have mental pain from those things but now I have physical pain from my anorexia, and yet, I would still go back into restriction. I don’t know why, but I felt safe.

Everything felt hopeless, I was disabled due to being underweight, I barely even knew any of the real medical aspects of recovery, and no one could give me any worthwhile weight gain tips. So here\'s some of the biggest things that helped me, and I hope they can help someone in a similar situation. Obviously, these are just things that helped me in a tight spot and medical guidance is extremely highly recommended if possible. \n\nThe most important thing was to intake as many calories as possible, no matter what it was. Being on a super tight budget, fast food, LOTS of peanut butter, eggs, and granola bars were my best friends. The thing that made the biggest difference at first was having many small snacks readily available throughout the day. Eat everything you can get your hands on, eat everything that makes you feel good. Guilty pleasures aren\'t real. I had a hard time gathering an appetite for anything, but I found that even a couple bites of something light (ex. watermelon, cucumber, crackers, etc) helped with that. When I felt like I couldn\'t even down that, water with MIO or lemon/lime did the trick. \n\nThe next thing was forcing food down, no matter what. I learned it Will hurt at first, but it must be done (look into refeeding guidelines, however, because in certain situations it can be dangerous) Your stomach does shrink over time, and it has to be retrained to intake a normal amount of food, as I\'m sure a lot of people in this situation know already. All I can say is keep pushing. It is worth it. \n\nOn a more emotional level, I found it was actually very helpful for me to completely get off of social media and stop taking pictures of myself for the time being. Things like Instagram and Twitter where I was constantly bombarded with pretty, "perfectly" figured girls only made things more miserable. \n\nAs for specific foods, I found you CANNOT have ANY sort of diet restrictions. (Save for medically necessary of course)  Meat, dairy, etc CANNOT be off limits if not needed. Dairy in particular was a Huge part of my recovery. \nProtein shakes helped a bit, but I personally found that creatine supplements helped even more. \nI hate Nestle as much as the next person, but their benecalorie supplements helped So much on days where I felt I couldn\'t get enough calories in. Cook it in pancakes, put it in your cereal milk, mix it in a smoothie/milkshake, etc. Clifbars, Lil Debbie\'s nutter butters, and pasta were my next best friends. Like I said, guilty pleasures aren\'t real. Get whatever has the most calories.\n\n However, long-term restrictions in diet inevitably lead to vitamin deficiency. If possible, get blood work done at the least to see what\'s needed. Do eat fruit/veggies between higher calorie foods to make sure you\'re getting what you need. Take a multivitamin every day, soak up some sun when possible, and absolutely do NOT feel guilt for sitting around doing absolutely nothing. That\'s more calories you get to keep, and they\'re your absolute best friend during this. Every calorie counts. \nIt\'s a long, shitty road with lots of bumps, and that\'s okay. Because it will make a difference, you will feel more like yourself, and if you\'re like me, you\'ll look back and wish you were coddling yourself the whole time. I\'m still in recovery myself over a year later, but I will never forget the path here. \nPlease dm me if there\'s any other specific foods/products etc you\'d like a link to, or even just to chat about it all. I know none of this is easy alone.'}, {'Recovery': 'I ate out today for the first time  went out with a friend and had ramen and chimichangas! looking forward to some ice cream for dessert.

She’s told me that she doesn’t know how she’s not dead yet from not eating for 4 days and she think she’s going to get tubed for “not eating” for “so long.” She keeps mentioning that she can’t eat, is discussing her weight and continually talks about her hunger pains.

I’m a big guy, let’s just say I’m over 2 bills, not weighing so I can’t get specific. And I have been retaining tons of water for months, as I have bitched on here about many times before. \n\nI’m not afraid of food, I have no restrictions, I am not afraid of fats or carbs, thanks be to God I actually love food now.\nIn the last several months I thought my appetite had stabilized at 3200-3500 cals a day. But my energy was depleting and I was just still sitting here like a big water balloon full of water… and then it hit me, I haven’t been really honoring my hunger.\nBut not because of emotional or mental desires to restrict, but simply old patterns of life. I got so used to “fasting” in my old life that lately I was just delaying breakfast which would practically ruin my appetite for the rest of the day. It almost seemed hard to even eat 3000 some days.\n\nSo yesterday I got up early and ate breakfast first thing in the morning and HOLY MOLY THE EXTREME HUNGER HAS RETURNED - clearly I haven’t recovered. I ate 6 meals yesterday and I tracked damn near 6000 calories. I have been an absolute vacuum cleaner ever since. Even in the middle of the night last night my body woke me up to eat. My pants fit more loosely on me today than they have in months. Water going away? I sure hope so!\n\nI’m super happy I figured this out but it’s also a bummer because it feels like I wasted months I could’ve been recovering, but maybe I just wasn’t ready yet ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \n\nI call it “convenience anorexia” because it is sometimes just easier to not eat because you’re so used to not spending much time eating - I used to eat once every other day for example.\n\nGetting out of this involves re-confronting ourselves so many times over and over and confronting fears of imperfection, rejection, pressure etc. All we can do is move forward and keep trying to get better. Trial and error. We must bravely be willing to get up and try again.\n\nI’m going to sleep with muffins and other goodies next to my bed tonight so I can eat them before I fall asleep and first thing in the morning!\n\nAnyway I hope this helps someone.

Even though this is not happening because of my anorexia, my ED is very happy and is encouraging me to embrace the opportunity and eat as little as possible.

Hey folks :D\n\nA bit of background (TW: numbers):\n\n22M\n\nThrough calorie restriction and exercise, I have lost weight below my body\'s natural comfort zone and have a BMI of about 18, on the high end of underweight. (I was naturally thin/athletic before my ED so now I am very lean.) Friends and family have been expressing concern about how thin I\'ve gotten as a result of my restrictive ED. Since returning home from college dorms at the end of the term, my mother has been persistent with her comments about how I do not eat enough, need to bulk up etc. Furthermore, I have been battling stubborn injuries that will not heal and I suspect it is due to my undernourishment. I have experienced many of the symptoms associated with being underweight like being tired, cold, irritable, and constantly thinking about food etc. On account of the aforementioned reasons, I have decided to make an attempt at recovery. I want my health and fitness back, this ED has made me tired, weak, and injury prone.  \n\nThe other day, I decided to go "all in" and honor my extreme hunger. I am recovering at home sans professional supervision. Because I am not severely malnourished, I do not think I am at risk of refeeding syndrome. Anyway, I have been making big batches of trail mix (Trader Joe\'s stylewith nuts, dried fruit, lots of chocolate chips, butterscotch chips etc.) Even after a full meal, I will still feel hungry and begin snacking incessantly. In the past two days, I must have eaten like 6+ cups of trail mix, lots of granola, protein/snack bars. It is absolutely ridiculous. It is getting to the point where I am eating snacks so constantly throughout the day that regular meals aren\'t even appealing because I have eaten well beyond my physical hunger cues. Is this ok? Should I take a more calculated approach of just 3 meals +snacks? Or should I continue to just raid my pantry every 20 minutes and only sit down for a proper meal if I am feeling inclined to? Bare in mind that with all the snacking, I have been consuming 3000 calories MINIMUM. Probably closer to 4k+ My stomach is a little uncomfortable from all of the food but I am trying to nourish myself with low volume calorie dense foods to avoid digestive distress (hence the trail mix).\n\nTLDR: Since going all in, my extreme hunger has lead me to snack incessantly.

Weed seriously helped me to maintain my mood and weight, as well as actually eating something..everything else didn't.

The longer I try to eat, and I'm currently experiencing extreme hunger(started recovery about 2 months ago and before that I tried to slowly start eating), the more drugs I want. I crave benzos so much. I crave the feeling of feeling free and shameless, just like when I was restricting. Nothing gets me to restrict anymore and I've been eating and eating and eating.

I had anorexia for 4 years, from age 16/ 17 to 20. I started my recovery in the spring of 2020, went through extreme hunger etc, and gained a lot of weight — about 25 kg initially. That was fine, I was okay with it, I knew it was part of the process.\n\nMy weight had more or less stabilized and I was at 85kg for a long time. Last year however, for a few months I lost some of the weight and went down to maybe 75kg. This wasn’t intentional and was because I was so busy and active that I guess I wasn’t eating as much as I needed. After this however, my weight went back to 85kg and was stable at around this weight again.\n\nHowever, in the last 2 months I’ve noticed I started gaining weight again. I tried not to freak out about it, and hadn’t weighed myself for the past few weeks, but tonight I finally did and have discovered I’m now at 89kg. I have to admit, I’m pretty upset about it. My bras and clothes are starting to not fit me. I don’t have the energy or mental capacity right now to go buy myself an entire new wardrobe. \n\nI don’t know what’s happening or why my weight is suddenly shooting up again. I’m just feeling very lost and confused. I think I eat pretty intuitively, like I eat when I’m hungry and I stop when I’m full. I also eat a bit of junk food or sweets sometimes when I’m craving it, but it’s not all the time. I just don’t know wtf is going on. I’m eating the same way I have been from the beginning of my recovery, and from when my weight was stabilized at 85kg. \n\nThere are only 3 things I can think of that might possibly contribute to weight gain?? \n1. I have been taking Wellbutrin for the past few months. But I don’t know why it would only “kick in” with the weight gain now instead of 3-4 months ago when I first started taking it? \n2. My meals were pretty irregular these past few months. I was fasting without really intending to, because I’m depressed and would wake up and not have the energy or motivation to make myself a big breakfast or to feed myself super regularly during the day time. But, I’d eat a lot at night and by the end of the day always felt satisfied (not still starving). However, I have since fixed how I’m feeding myself and am eating breakfast and lunch every single day, and not unintentionally fasting, and eating larger portions for breakfast and lunch so that I’m not starving in the evening. \n3. I did a parasite cleanse this past week in the hopes that it might help me with my IBS. It made me feel super out-of-it for the first few days, but now I’m feeling all normal again. I know parasite cleanses can release heavy metals (from the dying worms, they tend to hold on to heavy metals) and I have heard before that when the body is faced with toxins that it can’t process right away, it tries to store it in fat/ gain fat in order to put it away somewhere “safe” that won’t damage the body.\n\nBesides these reasons, could it just be the natural process of recovery? Has anyone else experienced this, where your weight suddenly shot up in the middle of your recovery out of the blue? If so, how long did it last/ how long did your recovery ultimately last afterwards? I’m trying to be patient with my body but I’m just so tired of living like this. It’s exhausting having to manage my body image issues, shopping for clothing, etc. All that while I am struggling with bad mental health issues and a ton of issues in my family. I also have serious body dysmorphia, so this is triggering me A LOT. Not to mention, it’s almost impossible for me to find clothes in my size because I live in Asia and everything here is made for tiny people (I grew up here and am living with my family atm). \n\nThank you to anyone for your help/ input or if you can share your story and give me some hope while I’m feeling super lost and distraught.'}, {'Recovery': 'My bf accidentally triggered my anorexia 🙃  I haven’t had food in a few days now and it’s starting to show physically.'}, {'Recovery': 'does anyone else eat more than 5k cals daily (extreme hunger)  i’ve been like this for a few days and i’ve never felt so alone :’) other people’s recovery seems so clean and perfect while mine is just a mess and a bunch of junk, fast food, and constantly eating at night since i’m so hungry'}, {'Disordered': 'random question  quick question (kinda weird sorry lolol) but will my breasts grow when im recovered? because i dropped two cup sizes during my ed and i see them starting to get bigger, so will they continue???'}, {'Disordered': 'Buying Lingerie for the Body Conscious  '}, {'Disordered': 'Meal plan/dietician appointment  i recently switched to a meal plan with exchanges instead of focusing on calories (w my dietician) but im still finding it kind of triggering to use an exchange meal plan bc now my mom and i have been measuring my food (which I’ve never done before) and it’s just so much effort, like I just want to be be able to eat whatever and however much I want without having to worry about how many “exchanges” it is.

No one wants to believe I was anorexic because I was “ripped and fit” and so I’m completely brushed off when people see me now and see I’ve gained all this weight. I feel like if I were a woman and even mentioned eating disorder everyone would be compassionate, but because I’m a man I get laughed at and scoffed at. Usually followed by FUCKING DIETING ADVICE that I most certainly did not ask for.\n\nIt took me 14 months of “adrenal fatigue” - which I think is just code word for “anorexic/orthorexic who doesn’t want to accept it” before coming to terms with my issues.\n\nI would say that emotionally I’m very far along in recovery. I can enjoy a milkshake without guilt. I like food. I enjoy making memories with my family at mealtimes. I also like trying new things and I am in love with fruit (fruit used to terrify me). Like I LOOOVE fruit. And ever since I started eating and loving food - poof - adrenal fatigue disappeared. So I’m happy. More energy, heart rate is no longer Bradycardic, it’s finally up to normal range.\n\nBut holy moly the edema is killing me. I gained some fat, sure, and honestly I don’t give a f about the fat. The edema is killing my feet. It makes life so hard and uncomfortable. My weight has stabilized (I don’t weigh myself but you can tell), and even some of the water has come off - I realized I was supplementing sodium for the “adrenal fatigue” and a few weeks ago the sodium drink started tasting like absolute garbage to me, so I listened to my body and stopped taking it. Since then the edema came down about 20% and now I can actually to some degree function. But man I want it gone. Any tips? Recommendations? I feel like one day in this body takes 20 x more energy just to get around than it used to. It’s soooo tight but also SOOOO heavy. Water is heavier than fat. Everything hurts. I feel like my life is passing me by - playing with my kids is hard, work is hard.

I have struggled on and off with periods of hating my body, restricting my calories, and obsessing over my weight.  It started in 2018 when I was 25.  My whole life I had been tiny and chronically underweight due to having been born severely premature at 26 weeks.  My entire childhood was focused on getting me to eat more and gain weight so I could grow.  By the time I reached my adult height I had stabilized my weight, but was still classed as underweight to a not insignificant degree.  \n\nIt was in my mid 20s when I first noticed that I had started to gain weight, and was now classed as having a “normal” bmi, albeit at the very bottom end of normal.  For some reason this terrified me. It was like for the first time in my life, I realized that I was just as susceptible to “getting fat” as everyone else, and I started significantly reducing my caloric intake and weighed myself obsessively, multiple times a day.  I eventually dropped back to the weight I had been at during adolescence, and I felt better and stopped restricting.  Of course my weight went back up, and in 2020 the panic set in again and I went back to restricting.  Again I returned to my baseline weight, and felt better and stopped the restriction.  I’m now back two years later, having the same struggles as before with hating my body, being terrified of gaining weight and carefully monitoring my calories while keeping daily track of my weight.  This time though, the voices in my head are more insidious than they have been in the past.  Previously I had been satisfied with my adolescent weight, but now they’re telling me to push it just a little farther, to see just how far I  can go.  I’m aware of the dangers of losing too much weight, but my brain is telling me that what I want doesn’t count as too much, and I’m having trouble knowing what to believe.\n\nI spoke to my therapist about all of this this afternoon, and she said I could be considered “diagnosable” for anorexia.  I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that I could have an eating disorder, because my symptoms don’t seem “that serious”.  I’m scheduled to speak to a nutritionist next week, and I’m terrified at the thought of her telling me I need to stop restricting my food intake.  Earlier this week one of my other therapists asked me to do her a favor and increase my caloric intake back to a level that would sustain my current “low/normal” weight at least until I speak to the nutritionist, and I had a panic attack.\n\nI’m just very confused right now, I don’t know if my current predicament is serious, and I don’t know what to do to make the angry voices in my head telling me I need to lose weight go away, if it turns out this is a problem.\n\nI don’t really know why I made this post, I guess I just needed some people to talk to who’ve been through it, and who could reassure me that I’m not crazy.  Thank you to everyone who made it this far.'}, {'Disordered': "I don't know where I am right now  So..I've been in some kind of recovery for the past 9 months, I gained a bit and classify as 'normally underweight' at the moment. I mean, I feel like shit. I feel worthless, my bpd symptoms are getting worse and worse, depression has been hitting me pretty hard, especially while I was trying to get off my addiction to benzos..The worst thing is, I gained a lot and lost a lot of weight this month and it's obviously confusing to see my body change from one thing to another in a span of 4 weeks. I don't know if I need to vent or get advice at this point. I started not going to school again and I deeply wish to be able to restrict again as I don't feel like myself at all. I started triggering myself after my bf had to leave for school last sunday(he's going to a boarding school about 1 1/2 hours away)as I was reminded of a trauma through the fact he's going on his final drive and will be even more far away. It's so hard to realise he's not my ex, which left me cold turkey for 3 weeks, after we were together everyday for 1 1/2 years,to go to poland with his family, telling me he knew since yesterday, that his grandma was sick, ect ect. Oh and his phone broke, so he couldn't contact me during his holiday while he was partying with his uncle on coke, meth and whatever else he took. I don't wanna know. All I know is that I almost died in these weeks last year. And I guess this triggered me. I didn't realise what my feelings were about since yesterday, but it's still hard to deal with. I didn't go psycho this time and distanced myself at first, because I know how hard it is to understand what I'm feeling when I'm in an episode like that and I truly don't want to hurt him. He's too precious to me to ever be abusive or mean or anything else to him and I promised I was going to get better. Our sole priority is to be healthier, this is our goal and I love how much good we're doing to each other. But I started lacking. I know it's not really my fault, but there were 2 incidents on May 1st. Both in which I got sexually used or absued and it's tearing me apart. I don't even know how many times this has happened until now. I'm not in therapy anymore, but I immediately looked for help after all of this went down. Yesterday I've had an appointement at a womens counseling centre with our school pedagogue and it was amazing! But I'm still overeating like crazy and everything feels so heavy. My head is spinning around all these responsibilities. School, work, friends and a relationship..damn that's hard to manage. And besides from all that chaos is me. My doc just told me I'm overworked and need to rest. Because of all the work I did in the last few months I may as well will have chronic pains in my right arm, which I painfully had to accept after wrting 4 double pages of vocabulary yesterday..\nBut as all of this is going down, I can't seem to rest. I've been thinking about hurting myself or even ending my life, because I can't take it anymore. I'm trying so hard. I don't want to be addicted, I don't want to hate myself, I don't want to fail in school, I don't wanna leave my job and stay at home again. I'm done feeling like this and I know I'm the only one that's able to change this, but as hard as I try, I can't even be honest. Sometimes I physically couldn't speak even when I tried to. On that sunday, last week, I had a panic/anxiety attack and it's getting worse. For about 10-15 minutes, I was frozen. When I finally woke up, it took me another few minutes to move my fingers and then a bit of my body again. All of this is scaring me. I'm always on edge.

For the most part, it was kind of an unintentional ED, combined with a lot of eating issues I had post-COVID (suddenly allergic to some foods, many foods tasting different and bad, so having to force myself to eat random things that are tolerable). I was originally taken off due to concerns I expressed over cardiac health. I did a holter monitor for 48 hours and no problems were found. But my doctor never discussed with me an alternative treatment for my ADHD, nor has the topic of going back on my meds come up. Sometimes I want to ask about going back on meds, other times I\'m like, nah, no meds is good for you. Mostly, being off any meds has been... weird.   \nLike, some days I find I function pretty okay, other days it\'s like I\'m lost in space. And in terms of recovery, there were days I was miserable when I was totally unable to gain weight, in constant physical discomfort/pain - so some days I\'m glad to be gaining and then the other days...  \n\n\nWell, the other days are the reason for this post: the bad days seem to be getting worse. The other night, I literally woke up crying because I had a dream \\[or I guess \\*nightmare\\*\\] where I was getting ready for work like usual and before heading out the door, looked in my full length mirror and I had gained a bunch of weight and I had huge elephant-like legs?? I literally said horrible insults to myself in my dream and thats when I woke up in tears. As a result, I found myself yesterday being hyper-critical about eating and wound up restricting.  \nI mean, what the hell???? I\'m in my mid-twenties and dealt with anorexia when I was in high school too, and NEVER did I have a nightmare that was obviously my sub-conscious freaking out about eating or gaining. In terms of mental illness relating to the ED, I\'m way more fucked up over the recovery process than I was throughout the whole time I kept losing weight, since it was almost all unintentional. It\'s only now I realize it actually was an illness and not just "la-dee-da, long-covid making food suck, whoopsie I\'m losing weight!"  \n\n\nI don\'t know if I\'m making any sense here. I guess what I\'m wondering is, has anyone else had these weird nightmares?

Regardless of whether this does cause me weight gain, I will be stopping it, i just can’t find any research or experiences which show that you don’t have to walk to maintain weight - everything is about weight loss or preventing weight gain. \n\nI’m aware I have disordered beliefs around weight gain - please don’t point this out - bear in mind I am in recovery from AN and this is something I am working on.

I had anorexia nervosa for 15 years as young as age 12, so it has been so hard pushing back against everything I ever knew.  But it was worth it.  It was worth every anxiety provoking moment and every triggering moment from stupid doctors who don’t know shit about anorexia nervosa and dumb ignorant people who would make pregnancy comments because of my very prominent recovery belly.  There were even tears especially in the beginning months, but I fucking did it.\n\nA year ago, almost every one of my ribs showed and I had a very concave stomach.  Now for the first time ever I no longer fit in children’s clothing.  Shopped in the women’s section for the first time in my life as a 27 year old woman a few days ago.  Recovery was sooo hard for me because I was most insecure about my stomach that I starved myself to the point of my stomach completely disappearing without realizing how severe it got.  And as a consequence I got a large recovery belly that made me feel awful.  But it’s starting to feel empowering.  My thoughts were ridiculous during the eating disorder since I never had much of a stomach, but now I see that life is not terrible even when I do have a bigger stomach.  That worry was all in my head.  My body image is a work in progress but I feel better about myself each day. Not to mention the health benefits: my hair grew back, lower blood pressure, no more anxiety, better sleep, I can actually concentrate, I no longer feel like passing out multiple times a day, etc.  \n\nThe biggest thought that kept me going at 100% every single day for a year was that the sooner I go in, the sooner it will all be over.  I didn’t have faith in the process at the beginning, but now I completely do.  Since I’ve starved since I was a preteen for 15 years and became skin and bones, my recovery timeline and overshoot gains  were greater than average.  Despite my path being longer than most, I am so looking forward to living a life 100% free of the eating disorder. I got through the first year without ever slipping up despite it being the hardest thing I’ve ever done.  Nothing can stop me now!!!'}, {'Recovery': 'Always triggered by other people’s bodies  TW💛\nIt’s crazy right?

A significant number of participants experienced remission of symptoms.\n\nIn animal models it is postulated that anorexia symptoms were an evolutionary advantage for some individuals in a population related to food scarcity triggering behavior changes and migration to new areas with greater resources.  In a study with black lab rats, food scarcity resulted in a small percentage of female rats decreasing food intake, increasing physical activity, and displaying increased anxiety behavior.\n\nI am a provider that treats mainly Anxiety, Depression, and PTSD with sublingual ketamine.

I\'d only gone in to sort out my intolerances/allergies - which I now realise is because I was having issues with my safe foods which put me in a difficult place. I am 100% commited to recovery, and I don\'t hear that mean voice in my head making me do stupid things - but I had blissfully deluded myself and excused my problems away. I\'m upset with myself for not seeing that, and as much as it hurt, I felt a whole lot better when the doctor praised me for coming for help - even if I didn\'t realise why I\'d truly gone. I was so ready to walk out if they told me to "just eat more, doesn\'t matter what, just more" like the ED doctor I had seen did. But, the dietician instead has given me concrete things to work with - little things like trying to add more oils and fats to food I already eat, helping me understand what of my safe foods were the ones I could work with to help me, setting alarms to practice mechanical eating, and trying new things like changing what kind of utensils I eat with. I feel... A bit frazzled right now honestly. Because I am so glad to have a doctor who can help me fix my habits, but I also feel so blindsided realising I\'m not as well as I thought I was.

I have not been underweight for about 5 months, and though weight gain was uncomfortable, I had not approached what I would consider an “unacceptable” weight until recently. I was somewhat relieved by the fact that the weight gain seemed to be slowing down, but this week it increased by more than it had been for several weeks. \n\nI cannot seem to cope with this anxiety and accept not only this reality, but the fact that it will likely continue to increase to a range that is even scarier for me. I don’t feel like what I am eating is enough to warrant ongoing, unrelenting weight gain at this point and I am feeling incredibly frustrated by the perpetual cycle of disappointment every week when I step on the scale (I have to for my therapy and nutrition sessions), the constant outgrowing of clothes, and the never ending attempts to adapt physically and mentally to the body I see in mirrors and photos.\n\nNow that I’ve reached this point (of gaining in a range that is “unacceptable” to me), I am really struggling to move past this and was wondering if others have been in this situation and how you’ve gotten through it. I feel like by this point in my treatment, I should be able to handle this and am similarly frustrated that I can’t. Even going through the benefits of recovery isn’t really touching it.

I would like to start this off by apologizing for the length of this post.\n\nI started actual recovery four days ago. This time, I'm actually committed.

Please, if you can, help me with these. \n\nJust to reinforce the title, the last question can be a little triggering, or maybe not. I'm not sure, but if I were to see that at my lowest point I would be quite triggered myself. ease proceed with caution (:.\n\n1) Extreme hunger or binge eating?\n\nI read online that in the beginning of recovery you experience something known as extreme hunger. It makes sense, but then I heard someone referring to it as recovery binging. I did some more research and I read that I could be developing BED, that's not my end goal and I don't know how to prevent it. I don't know what it is, but when will this period end? How long does it take, generally? I feel as if it won't ever stop, it scares me. I don't want to call this binging but the more I think about it, the worse it gets.\n\n2) How long does weight redistribution take to occur?\n\nI love joking about this but right now I look like Vector, it's all fun and games until I realize how stupid I probably look to others. I know I should wear baggy clothing but the feeling of uncomfortableness from within does not go away by simply wearing something big. How long did it take for you guys? I know everybody is different but I would like to find an average.\n\n3) When the hell should I eat?\n\nI don't know when to eat, I've been following my mental hunger cues (even if I ate less than an hour ago) and I've been following my rare physical hunger cues, but I don't know when to eat. How distanced should my meals be, and should I wait until I feel physically hungry before I eat?\n\n4) How much should I eat?\n\nI don't want to eat beyond satisfaction and I don't want to eat below satisfaction either but there is no set point to satisfaction and it's making me extremely anxious. I don't like eating so frequently but I don't know why I keep thinking about food, even if I'm full as hell. \n\nTW // inpatient treatment\n\n5) I have not been sent to inpatient treatment but I feel like I need it, should I ask for it or is it too late?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I started recovery four days ago but I have not been sent to inpatient treatment. For the past four days I have been eating like shit, and each passing day becomes more and more mentally draining. After doing some research, I learned that the refeeding system is what is generally implemented with beginning stages of recovery. As of late, I have been feeling increasingly irritable due to the amount of food I have been consuming and I am scared of developing binge eating disorder. I understand that this is just extreme hunger but I don't know what to do\n\nI'm so sorry for the length of this post. Thank you to anyone who replies.

So I\'ve really hit restriction bad lately and I have gotten so used to the pain of hunger that I just ignore it most days because I don\'t even realize I\'m in it.

I\'m a voice actor, and I drank a shake about 30 minutes before I went in the booth.

I am in a good mood and having a great time? Even just the smallest amount of intake changed the way I felt like night and day and it helped me realize that providing myself with the things I need to survive doesn\'t have to hurt and now I have solid proof that yes, I WILL feel better whenever I treat my body kindly. It felt like such an "aha" moment and I\'m so thankful for it. I just had another shake this morning and am already feeling my body pains go away.

I\'m a 17 year old teenager with an ED that started May 2021 that result me losing my period and went from me being slightly overweight for my BMI (due to lack of mobility during covid) to being almost to underweight for my BMI ( I am an athlete so I probably lost muscle and have a larger body structure which is probably why even at my lowest weight I never dipped into an "underweight" bmi) Anyways I "came out" to my parents one day about my eating disorder last December as I realize it was ruining my life. I had went from a slightly insecure happy teenage girl to a girl who would only think about food and be angry all the time. I was also cold all the time and when I went on a trip to Las Vegas where it was literally 110 degrees, I was cold. It sucked. My hair started falling out and I didn\'t feel like myself. In the end, I started scaring myself with the pictures I took off myself. I went to the doctor and she said I had lost a lot of weight and said thats why I had lost my period and she put me on hormones, which didn\'t even work. At this point I knew I destroyed my body and wanted to recover for myself. It was hard but I started to raise my calories slowly each week by 100. I didn\'t notice a significant increase in weight and was just happy that I wasn\'t under a certain number. to put it in perspective, my lowest weight was the same when I was 12 years old. I have since then started recovery with Equip health and it hasn\'t been easy. I be honest, I still count calories ( in secret), but have increased it to 2,350. They have restricted my movement significantly which suxked because I weight lifted, walked around 1 to 2 miles daily and rollerskated every other day for maybe 2 to 3 hours making me moderately active. I\'ve only been skating recently under supervision IF I eat before and after which has been hard. The first days were especially hard, as they had me eat breakfast. I hadn\'t eaten breakfast for basically my entire life but taking it to the extreme during the height of ED doing intermittent fasting and not eating till sometimes 5pm. After the initials tantrums about not being in control of what I\'m eating and when to eat, its been going great!! This is my second week and I already am feeling so much better! I now have had breakfast everyday, poop everyday ( which is crazy because I\'ve had constipation problems my entire life) and just feel more energized and happy!!! Sometimes its hard to eat things that I don\'t feel are "worth it" or have enough protien, but I feel a lot freerer in general. I haven\'t been able to see my weight which doesn\'t bother me too much, it\'s just kinda of triggering when my parents hug me after weighing me because obviously I\'ve gained weight lol, but the I dont really care and my body looks the same, if anything just a little more filled out but I have so much more energy!! I also have gotten over my fear of oil and its really weird because it only took about a week!! Please keep in mind that this is my recovery journey and that everyone\'s is different and the quickness of my journey has been not only a shock to me, but my therapists. I\'ve had some great motivators, like as soon as I get my period back, I can exercise more moderately lol and I\'m very all or nothing so I put all the energy I focused on my ed into my recovery. I also feel that as I feel better about myself and in general l, its more of a motivator for me to get better. I\'m just pretty proud of myself and I want to let everyone here know who is struggling that recovery is worth it and starting sooner is way better than never trying. Another reason I think my review has been faster is because I was anorexic for less than a year. I know some people don\'t have that luxury, but just know that no matter where you are with your ED, its never to late to start recovery even if it is gradual. I hope this is motivating to you all out there and just know that weight shifts everyday and throughout life we are meant to grow and change. Getting rid of weighing yourself and setting a calorie goal helped me get better but it might differ for you!! I just hope you all help yourself by treating yourself and making yourself a priority in recovery!! <3'}, {'Recovery': "Blood Sugar / Hypoglycemia issues?

It's really tough because I don't feel thin anymore. When I look at myself I don't look thin to myself either, despite others telling me I'm still underweight and need to keep eating and gaining.\n\nI want to lose what I've gained and go back to where I was. I keep thinking that I was almost to my goal. Logically, this makes no sense, but it's hard to not give in and start restricting again."}, {'Disordered': "Anyone else experience insomnia during recovery?

Firstly, I think it’s amazing that there is a space here on Reddit for recovering people to find support. I wanted to find somewhere where I may be able to understand more about how I can support a recovering friend. They have been struggling with anorexia for many years now, but they are getting treatment. It is tough, as they are in hospital a lot, but we message and call a lot and I’m just trying to make sure I’m there for them.\n\nRecently they’ve started talking more about their body, and I’m not sure how I can approach conversations about it. As I have never experienced anorexia, I’m really nervous when they make comments on their medication making them gain weight etc. They have been making these comments about their body more frequently as of late. I don’t want to shut down what they’re saying, but I also don’t know how to reassure them in this situation. I feel like being told they’re beautiful etc is something they probably hear a lot, and as anorexia is more than just a physical illness I’m not sure whether it helps to tell them things like this. I was wondering whether anyone might be able to offer some insight in to how I could best help support them? No matter what I will be there for them, but I want to understand more about how I can support them ❤️'}, {'Disordered': "Freaking out over a tiny increase in my meal plan  I just got out of hospital yesterday and today did not go well so I had to make some changes.
