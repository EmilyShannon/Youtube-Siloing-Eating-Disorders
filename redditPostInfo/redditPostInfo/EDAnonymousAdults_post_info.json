Over the past few years I've struggled with disordered eating and the effect that it has had on my mind and body have been ridiculous. For me there were two main in side-effects which really impaired my quality of life and ability to recover. \n\nFirst, I became disconnected from my emotions. Emotions, those things that usually present themselves in our conscious minds to inform our behavior and indicate a correct path of action? yeah, they felt completely absent. I even took to sometimes fabricating the emotion that I knew I would have felt in a particular circumstance based on how I would've been before. For example if during a test I would usually feel anxious but as a result of being too starved to feel anything, I didn't, I would try and get myself to feel more anxious and stressed (which usually didn't work anyway). \n\nSecond, I lost the ability to work and sleep normally. I cannot tell you how detrimental this has been for me. I am a hard-working student, very smart and ambitious. The number of times I sat down at a desk completely ready to study and eager to learn new material only to find that hunger pangs would start up and interfere with my concentration is too numerous to count. I eventually even gave up every time I had a hunger pang because when I tried to eat something I would feel uncomfortable. \n\nThis situation has carried on for so long that I tried out of desperation to do nutty things like get into a relationship with my parent's married neighbor because I thought it would shake me out of my problematic daily life. A relationship would've taken things too far but he was also just a nice person and he would've been willing to take me for a drive or something to get my mind off of things but because my brain was malfunctioning I couldn't take him up on even those completely harmless opportunities. I feel so bad because I haven't been able to be myself these past few years and I think if I had been I wouldn't have affected the people around me in the way that I did or caused myself so much mental angst. \n\nLastly my eating disorder made it nearly impossible to control my arousal. I would get aroused much more frequently and feel like those sensations were much more out of my control- to the point where I'd be with family- my uncle and cousins at the park- and be smelling like some kind of fragrant seductive flower. All of these things combined have just been so much and really an exhausting way to live. But I don't have it in my genes to give up so I just keep going hoping things will get better. \n\nI have a two year plan that I hope I can achieve and that will improve my life on multiple fronts. First, I'm hoping to graduate from my school with a double major in Astrophysics and Philosophy. I also hope to spend the next two years here taking advantage of research opportunities, getting to know some people and participating in college life like parties to an extent.  I can't change the past and have let it go to a large degree. I can only move forward, focus on the people and relationships around me, and the potential for a good life that persists in my mind and body."}, {'Disordered': "Really struggling with this pregnancy.

That makes me think I’m doing better in my ED but I just went almost 2 weeks with only eating a single 60 calorie yogurt the whole 2 weeks. And I only ate it bc I felt like I was gonna pass out and I had to walk to class. I’ve also been able to go out to my college bars even though I’m like 20 pounds heavier than I normally weigh (because of eating whatever I wanted during study abroad). Before, if I weighed even like 5 pounds more I would refuse to go out and see people. So it definitely seems like I’m getting better but I just hit a new record for days without food. Sorry that isn’t a positive record to hit but I wasn’t sure how else to word that. Im so confused with my ED right now because it’s really contradicting itself. I also don’t know if I feel happy about being less rigid or nervous I might get better from my ED. I genuinely don’t want to get better bc I hate feeling/being fat.

How could that be possible? Asked what they weigh. I said “I have no idea. I don’t know what anyone weighs. I don’t care”. He told me to guess. I said “No. I couldn’t even if I tried. I also do not want to try”. He asked why and then proceeded to guess my weight. Under by 1kg. I gave him the strongest talk so far. Later he asked if I was “having lunch or fasting?” I do not fast.

I\'m currently the "socially acceptable" version of disordered as an adult--still high-functioning as long as I stave off the depression, low-ish end of healthy BMI, somewhat fit, and objectively better-looking than when I was 20-25lb heavier. \n\nI have been killing my appetite with a sketchy combo of antidepressants, pseudo-stimulants and OTC medications/"supplements" for the past couple of years, and nobody suspects a thing. I\'m also constantly checking my fingers/waist/thighs/face and disgusted with how they look. The prospect of potentially gaining weight, be it due to going off antidepressants or gaining muscle (or both, ideally) terrifies me. \n\nMy psychiatrist is not concerned. My family and friends praise the weight loss. The thing is, I\'d like to get off my antidepressants eventually, and I\'d really like to keep getting stronger & more fit.

So I\'ve been home either sick or caring for sick children, and my food and exercise routines are all out of whack. From August last year till around two months ago, I was finally almost at my lifetime "goal weight" (which forever changes, but I was very much in the ballpark and feeling SO GOOD about being on top of everything for once), but I\'ve been thrown off course by all constant illness.\n\nToday I went to my blood donation appointment. I had the interview beforehand and because my weight is a little higher than it was at my donation a month ago I was able to donate more blood today, which should be a good thing but of course I felt like a huge failure and so embarrassed.\n\nWe move to the donation chair. As usual, I had barely eaten beforehand, and hadn\'t drunk as much water as I should have, because one of my motivations for donating blood, (besides it being a good thing to do to help others) is to Burn Maximum Calories, i.e. by eating as little as I can before and after, to get the biggest calorie burn possible. I know this is all so ridiculous, and probably not even REAL. Normally it doesn\'t affect my donation, but the trip home can be a little lightheaded sometimes. Today, I was obviously dehydrated so the nurse missed the vein in one arm, and then when they got the vein in my other arm, it was a really slow flow of blood and blew out and caused a haematoma, so they couldn\'t proceed today.\n\nSo now I\'m back home, I\'ve got both elbows wrapped up, a large painful swollen arm and bruise where the vein blew, and I can\'t donate again till next week. I\'m disappointed that my ridiculous restrictive behaviour and obsession meant that I wasn\'t able to donate. It\'s times like these I really notice how messed up my brain is. On the way home, I couldn\'t stop ruminating on the whole situation, I feel shame for having gained weight, and disappointment for not being able to donate and frustration and anxiety for my calorie burn plans being thwarted for today. I feel like I\'ll be a failure forever, my weight is out of my control and I\'m basically out of control in life. No balance.

I haven\'t purged in months and genuinely don\'t want to purge again. I have some days where I eat more than I should (but not an out-of-control binge) and some days where I eat below maintenance and feel fine. In doing so, my weight has been pretty stable, a high "normal" BMI, but I\'m noticeably getting more fit as I\'ve been consistently working out more. I feel satisfied that I look good enough, even if I could look better. I feel satisfied that I eat well enough, even if I could eat better. It\'s better.\n\nSo if I\'m pretty much at peace, why would I want to get cosmetic procedures to change my body? Recovery warriors would decry my decision, saying I should learn to fully accept it as it is. But I thought it would be worth it, far more worth it than any ED behavior.\n\nThe idea behind CoolSculpting is that when fat cells in an area are pinched off, frozen to death, and eventually cleared by the immune system, it reduces the fat levels in the area *proportional* to the level of fat in the rest of your body. (As we know, fat gain and loss affects fat everywhere. Someone with a BBL won\'t lose her relatively big booty if she loses weight, and someone with chunks of fat removed from her breasts in a reduction won\'t get huge boobs again if she gains weight.) My desired results wouldn\'t be something I would have to micromanage daily. The long-term proportional change would persist at any weight (although it\'s most pronounced if you\'re not too lean but not too fat for a clear contrast - like me!).\n\nThe first thing I got was flanks. No matter whether I was at my fattest or my thinnest, I didn\'t like the inward dip. I thought my figure could look so much more womanly if only its width would keep smoothly increasing from my waist down to my hips.\n\nFor one side at a time, I endured the tight pinch of the applicators, the sharp cold that soon turned me numb, and the godawful massage afterwards to break up the hard crystallized fat. I thought I was going to look so newly shapely at an event later that week. Imagine my shock when I was told it was going to be extra swollen for days at first, and only after a month would I start seeing the difference, with final results after three months!\n\nOnce that time passed, I did notice. It felt weird for my hand to brush by my hip and feel a nothingness where the boundary of my body was once expected. It indeed gave me smoother uninterrupted curves, and my hipbones were pronounced the way they were at a lower weight before. I thought, *Thank you!* Now that I knew it worked, I booked my next appointment - tummy. They said they wouldn\'t do my upper abs because there wasn\'t enough fat to pinch, but I could do lower abs. Who wouldn\'t want a flatter lower belly, right?\n\nThis time, the two-minute massage was TORTURE. The fat had to be broken up vigorously over my organs, not backed by nearby bone; last time I couldn\'t help but go "ah!", but here I couldn\'t help but scream and cry. One minute has already felt like way too long ("is it almost done?!") when I was told "halfway there!" For a week afterwards, my tummy was bruised and painfully swollen.\n\nI\'d like to say it worked. But I honestly don\'t know how my lower tummy would look different now at my level of fitness had I not done it. This seems to be a common "didn\'t do anything" area anecdotally unless you have a pronounced tummy and get multiple rounds.\n\nMy third appointment, since I couldn\'t do upper abs, was frontal bra line. The pinch hurt worse, but the massage was so easy, since the fat was being crushed over my rigid ribcage. Now I have ribcage definition at a higher weight than I\'ve ever seen it, and my bras feel more comfortable. (Proper-fitting clothes feel much better on harder body mass.) I do wish I could\'ve gotten upper abs to even it out, though, because I think my waist is less inwardly curved in comparison now.\n\nThen I got CoolToning, better for tummies with less fat to lose (and also buttocks and thighs!). The magnetic stimulation feels bizarre; it makes your abs suck outward harder than EVER, painful at first but easy to adjust to. Not everyone can handle 100% intensity, but I could. The muscle toning is real. It gave nice results and pushed me further along in exercise progress.\n\nThere are some people who get procedure after procedure, never satisfied. But generally, [cosmetic procedures have been found to lead to lasting satisfaction with one\'s improved appearance](https://nautil.us/the-loophole-in-the-hedonic-treadmill-4482/).

I\'m not saying I\'m an expert on this topic btw, though to be fair I fucking should be at this point, god knows I\'ve got plenty of experience to draw on.     \n       \nObviously this is a generalisation, but in my experience people with eating disorders tend to be more vulnerable in relationships, whether that\'s because of low self-worth, pre-existing trauma, dodgy health, etc. And let\'s be real, the type of people who are attracted to you when you\'re actively disordered tend not to be... the best.     \n      \nI\'m 33 and I\'m now in my first ever healthy relationship. Prior to this, I was *famously* bad at figuring out when a relationship was abusive. Like, I literally spent my teens and 20s legally classed as "vulnerable to sexual exploitation" because I was such an utter liability.     \n      \nAs an example... after I broke up with my most recent ex, I very reluctantly spoke to the police because he was literally stalking me and sending me v disturbing material. They asked if the relationship had been abusive, and I was like "Naaaaah... it wasn\'t healthy but I wouldn\'t say it was *abusive*!" They asked more questions, turns out not only was it *definitely* abusive, they considered me at high risk of literally being murdered. I\'d managed to convince myself that stuff like breaking my fingers and strangling me til I lost my voice and had black bruises around my neck, was no big deal and probably something I deserved. That stuff wasn\'t even the reason I broke up with him.     \n      \nThis guy was super into me being younger than him, and very much encouraged my eating disorder - he wasn\'t overt about it, but he definitely knew what he was doing. Imo those things are both massive red flags. As it turns out, he ended up admitting to fantasising about my childhood abuse and apparently moved on to trying to find images of the abuse online (that\'s what he says at least, def could\'ve just been looking for images in general). Obviously this is a bit of an extreme example, I guess my point is that normal, healthy, supportive partners do not encourage eating disorders. It\'s not normal for severely unwell people to be someone\'s "type". It just isn\'t.     \n       \nI also think, if someone is saying very triggering things about your body or if they encourage you to restrict/lose weight/whatever, knowing you have an eating disorder...  they most probably know what they\'re doing. It\'s not a ~lol boys are so dumb~ situation, or a case of someone being blunt or socially awkward. They know it hurts and for whatever reason they\'ve decided to do it anyway. Doesn\'t automatically mean they\'re a predator, but at the very least it\'s a shitty thing to do.     \n      \nIdk. Is this something people have noticed or think about much? Do you guys think you\'ve got what you need to figure out what sort of behaviour is or isn\'t ok? Do you know what steps you can take to protect yourself if you need to?

I’m really not even sure anymore if you can call it a relationship. \n\nYesterday we all went out and it was really nice spending time together as a family. But I’m starting to notice things now that I previously didn’t as I process all of my unresolved trauma. Last night I realized that my dad is also deeply affected by ED, and I’m not even sure he realizes it.\n\nMy mom’s ED affected us all. Me. My sisters. And my dad. No one was immune. We were out from 6pm until almost 10:30pm. My dad mentioned towards the end that he was hungry. He then said he hadn’t yet eaten that day. \n\nI was mad and surprised to hear this. My dad is 66. I asked why he didn’t eat before he left the house, knowing that we would be out late. I want him to take care of himself. He then said that he and my mom don’t usually eat until 8pm or so. I said, “why so late?” He just kind of shrugged. He then texted me after we all got back home and said he had a salad. A salad. That was all he ate all day. And my mom never cooked growing up, so everyone was left to fend for themselves. I recall my dad often snacking on Oreos and ice cream. None of us have ever had a healthy relationship with food.\n\nWe also had a family picnic last weekend and I brought ice cream sandwiches for everyone as I didn’t want to come empty handed. There were quite a few leftover and I left the box in my parent’s freezer. My dad finished them off, like multiple at a time, and last night he was shaming himself for it. He grabbed his gut and said he can’t lose it. It’s like my dad is stuck in a binge-restrict cycle and he doesn’t even realize it. It breaks my heart. \n\nMy dad was also super fixated on getting in as much steps as possible last night. Everyone in our family wears stupid fitness trackers. My sisters (and now mom) are marathon runners. I am a long distance runner and even my dad has taken up long distance running in his later years. \n\nBut he was absolutely obsessed with the steps last night. My dad and I were kind of joking around about getting our steps in. I didn’t really like it, but my dad kept pushing the issue wanting to know how many steps I was at. My dad doesn’t know I have relapsed, so he didn’t understand that what he was doing could potentially be triggering. My mom *does* know I relapsed though. She was the first one to notice. \n\nAt the end of the outing, my dad asked how many I had and I told him. It was a high number. He was disappointed in himself as his number wasn’t as high. And he’s like, ‘you went for a run today, didn’t you?’ I said yes and then my mom said, “well I got (insert astronomical numbers of steps here).” And then she proceeded to say, “I get up at 5am every day and go for an hour swim, then go running for a few hours later on.” And then she goes swimming again. She does this every single day. \n\nI was seething with rage by this point. She KNOWS I relapsed. And I’m trying to understand how she claims she is concerned about me when she would *deliberately* trigger me like that. And she acted cold towards me all night last night, so I don’t believe she is clueless. My dad also got out of the car to hug me goodnight and my mom didn’t. She just said, “bye”. I know EDs can be competitive in nature, but still. It’s just really hard for me to believe anything other than that the only reason she wants to call me out on my relapse is because she views it as a competition between us both. \n\nAnd today I pushed myself even harder on my run. She’s in my head and I can’t get her out. \n\nI vented to my husband about everything this morning and he gently reminded me that she struggles with mental illness too. And that’s what ED is—a mental illness. But still. I’m tired of having empathy for her. I’m tired of being triggered every time I see my family. I’m just tired.\n\nI just have so many emotions after last night. I feel sad knowing just how much ED has impacted my entire family. I hate that I have to realize and process all of this. It is exhausting. I feel for everyone—especially my dad now. I am struggling to feel anything other than hatred towards my mom right now.

It\'s so frustrating and it always makes me as much angry and sad each time. So here are today\'s examples...\n\nTomorrow is a bank holiday where I live and bank holidays are so triggering because they are the perfect opportunity to binge eat: no obligation but time to eat and time to rest... Since I have one binge eating episode per week for a couple of years I try to stick to this schedule to deal with the bank holiday: I can only binge on weekends, no exception, as hard as it is. Anyway, my plan was not to binge, to follow the usual routine and all, so no food shopping or anything: I stick to my routine and there\'s usually no binge on Thursday, this is what I do since more than 2 years so I can do it this week.\n\nSo I was in this good mindset, repeating that I only have to do what I did during the last 110+ weeks, it\'s totally doable, everything gonna be fine, etc, and then bam!, we\'ve been informed of a major change of the work hours and schedules because of the current heatwave. And of course, it immediately caused me some anxiety and, since binge eating is my coping mechanism, a massive urge to binge. I tried to breathe and stay rational, to calmly assimilate the informations and their impact, there\'s nothing complicated or grave, but the pulsion to stuff myself was so strong that as soon as I could take my lunch break I went to a supermarket to buy some sandwiches, pastries and donuts... Which is stupid and I hate in itself, but even more because it incidentally cancel all the previous efforts related to the bank holiday...\n\n**\\[TL;DR / conclusion\\]** I hate how my anxiety and so BED make me unable to deal with unplanned things, even the littlest ones, how I need my routine to deal with life, and how the lesser change causes/amplifies some binge eating urges which can totally overwhelm me. I hate how each progress (limiting enough the ED to have a semblance or normal life) is so precarious and never acquired. I hate that my instinctive reaction to anything unusual, any strong emotion, any change, etc, is to gobble food. I try to see all the progress I did throught the years/decades, and it\'s a lot, but it still seems so uncertain, and sometimes, like today, it also seems vain...

The weight was too heavy to carry on my own. But I didn’t want to burden anyone with it, especially because right now, I have no intention of recovering. I hid it from everyone. My husband finally said something after my mother reached out to him and he admitted he noticed how much weight I had lost and wasn’t sure how to approach the subject because we all know how complex EDs are. They have copious triggers, which must be approached very delicately. And I do know it’s exhausting for people to know what to say and how to say it.\n\nMy husband expressed his concern and he expressed concern on behalf of my mother. So I made an appointment with my therapist. No more secrets. Yesterday, I said to her, *WHY* is this all happening now? Like, all of these things from my past, why can’t I just get over it? Because outwardly, things in my life have never been better (and it’s true). So WHY can’t my stupid messed up mind catch up with me? \n\nAnd she said that’s exactly it. She said, “You have been through so much trauma and there are so many complex layers and you have just been moving through it. Surviving. You never had time to pause. But now you have stability in your life. You have a stable job after years of instability. You are in a stable relationship and now married after years of abuse and unloving partners. And even your relationship with your family is much better now. So now you have time to pause. You can start to digest.”\n\nAnd she said that it is just too much for me to pause and allow the feelings to come up that have been building over decades and I just can’t allow myself to feel all of this pain and digest everything. So I fall back onto my ED as a means to cope. \n\nAnd it really shook me to my core. Like, it really does all make sense now. \n\nI am not ready to recover yet. And I know like any addict—because that’s what an eating disorder is—I have to be ready to recover, but I am at least grateful I confided in her. She is a safe space. I am at least grateful I don’t have to harbor this awful secret anymore and I have someone who is qualified to help me carry it.\n\nMaybe one day I will choose recovery.

My Ed got so triggered and basically said “if she can have that body and be healthy why can’t I?” I have way more fat on my body than her so I must be fine.  I must be healthy because if she’s claiming she’s healthy while she’s underweight and zero body fat, I must get rid of this fat on my body.  I haven’t been eating much at all and I don’t understand how my body is functioning \n\nSo now I’ve been on an ocd kick and Doing what she talks about that helped her and her clients lose weight. I feel trapped and stuck.  On one hand, I feel like I’ve made some progress with my Ed because I am eating foods I didn’t eat before, but on the other hand , my orthorexia has gotten worse and my daily movement has been a lot and I feel exhausted and drained.  I feel torn in two directions and my body is tired :( but my Ed won’t fucking let this go.

I don’t disagree, but I have many legitimate reasons (chronic illness, medical devices, among others) I cannot go to treatment and have actually been told by more than one they couldn’t accept me due to the above. We have tried every possible route, and they are not possible.\n\nSo while we all see the need, we’re also realistic about my options, which are limited and only include outpatient care right now. \n\nWe were even starting to take a harm eduction approach in the context of treating my case as SE-AN/SE-ED (severe and enduring AN/ED), from a maintenance perspective, and I was following the agreed upon maintenance terms.\n\nThen yesterday, my dietitian randomly gave me an ultimatum that includes significant weight restoration (something I’ve been unable to do on my own, despite trying, the last few months), and if I don’t reach those goals, she can’t ethically keep working with me on an outpatient basis.\n\nI’m just scared.

If I lose her, I lose my coach. If I lose my coach, to be honest, I’ll probably end up losing my life, because these past months without the support of someone helping me get at the root issues has proven I can’t do it on my own (I spend all day, every day trying to figure it out in my own, and it’s just super obvious I need guidance in that area to move forward).\n\nI’m not absolving myself of the responsibility of taking action.

I feel like I’ve been doing very well with eating enough, I haven’t had any binges in weeks, and I’m not weighing myself obsessively. \n\nSO as a perk of joining you get several free semi-personal training sessions and the guy who was coaching me was pretty cool initially, and in general we got along well, but god he would not shut up about trying to tell me what to eat. \n\nLike, I didn’t ask for his opinion and I know I could lose some weight but like I don’t need someone telling me that protein makes you lose weight and carbs make you fat. This guy literally showed me an infographic for portion sizes of various foods, and the recommended portion size for veggies was like half the size of my palm. Not to mention, all of my safe foods are pretty much fruit or veggie related and now I’m afraid this guy is going to ruin them for me. I don’t want to overthink it because, I like this gym and I want to keep going, but I’m just annoyed that it’s been impossible for me to work out anywhere without someone trying to push some fad diet on me as though I don’t know how food works. \n\nOk thanks, rant over lol'}, {'Disordered': "Sandwich for lunch  Eating lunch.

Does it fall under the umbrella of an ED? My old therapist and google seems to think so.\n\n**Some background:** \n\nI\'m 31 and male, I\'ve had what I\'m coming to realise might be an ED since I was about 18/19. I\'ve given it several, less harsh names over the years - such as "being a foodie" or "not having a good relationship with food" or even just "having a big appetite". Basically this was all so that I could avoid acknowledging that this is more than likely some kind of ED linked to binge eating.\n\nMost people I know wouldn\'t think I had one because most of the time I only let myself see people when I\'m in pretty good shape. The rest of the time though I\'ve put on a lot of weight again and therefore hide myself away, so to them it\'s out of sight out of mind. To me it\'s constantly balancing between food hell and purgatory.\n\nI\'ve basically yo-yo\'d the same 15-25kg in bodyweight a great deal of times (about 2-3 times a year) since I was 18. My "routine" is basically as follows: I\'ll spend about 4 months punishing myself with gruelling exercise and low calorie targets (1100-1400 cals a day) and restrict myself to only super "clean" food. This 4month-ish period is punctuated with weak moments where I\'ll spend a day or two binge eating, I\'ll clock in at about 13-16,000 cals a day (I can eat a lot). Once I\'ve achieved my desired weight/look I then maintain for about a month and then fall off the wagon by spending the next 1-2 months in what feels like a hole of binge eating, I\'ll take in about 8,000 cals or more a day. Every single day I\'ll try to "get back on the wagon again" and get super motivated, to which I will then go into what I can only describe as autopilot and binge eat for half a day and then despise myself and regret it once it\'s over. After about a month or two of this I\'ve put all the weight back on, and I get to my "enough is enough" weight and start all over again. Rinse and repeat. It\'s exhausting and it\'s slowly ruining my life.\n\nSince reaching 30 I\'ve slowly but surely tried to confront myself that this is a serious problem. It has made me hate a good chunk of the past 13 years. The consequences of having it has cost me relationships and friendships due to spouts of super low confidence and sneak eating.\n\nSo that\'s my background.\n\nI\'m posting this partly to share my experience but mainly to get general advice and ideas of next steps once you\'ve made the initial leap of acknowledging there might be a problem.\n\nThanks all!'}, {'Disordered': 'Cupcakes were brought for someone’s birthday.

My doctor said I shouldn’t lose weight unsupervised.\n\nI’ve been hella unmotivated recently and have been eating more than I should and have thus gained weight. I told the nurse as much. For some UNGODLY reason she became completely focused on me eating corn cakes instead of bread (a remnant from my ED days yes, but also they have a long shelf life and I genuinely, hand on a Bible, enjoy eating them with toppings like salmon, they have a nice crunch). \n\nSo, the nurse literally googles the calorie count in one corn cake (”what could it weigh? 15 grams” ”I don’t know, I DON’T WEIGH MY FOOD ANYMORE”) and she was like SHOCKED that two corn cakes had 100 or so calories.

All of those kids were shit, and the adults that enabled them and didn't stop them are even worse. \n\nAnyways. I know that being angry about it won't change anything. But over a decade of ED later and in the midst of my worst relapse to date with no end in sight, I can't help it. I'm 25 years old and I still dread eating in front of others, have major anxieties about food, and despise the way I look. It feels so pathetic that I can't move on."}, {'Disordered': 'Why are my relapses so (comparatively) short?  I am definitely an “on and off” anorexic where I’ve cycled through restriction and quasi-recovery for years instead of consistently suffering. In my case I do so quite rapidly - my longest relapse has barely been 6 months, not counting time in treatment, and most are between 2-3 months. It doesn’t take long for things to get severe for me so maybe that’s why my relapses are so short-lived. I’m writing about this because this is my biggest point of comparison to others and biggest thing that makes me feel invalid. My illness onset was also short and I feel that I considered recovery too early for it to be serious. I hear people talk about experiencing their disorder for years before seeking help and having relapses that last >6 months. \n\nIdk…Is this more normal than I think it is? Can anyone else speak to this or relate?'}, {'Disordered': "Esophagitis?  TW maybe...\nI slipped up the other day and purged. I've been recovering for almost a year and had a bad day and made a bad choice. But, ever since then, I've been having severe pain in my chest after I swallow anything other than saliva.

I was excited to get all daily fruits, veggies, proteins and grains in. So boom, yeah this was supposed to be great. The one thing I didn't account for was food safety. I thought food would be fine in the fridge for a week, but I believe I was wrong. On about day 3 I begin getting headaches after every meal, and day 4 the headache was unbearable and all the food came back up the way it went down. That was kind of a relief. I'm going to give meal prep another go, but I'm going to freeze the meals this time, and instead of salads I believe I will do green smoothies since I've never head a problem with them. The bad part is I haven't really eaten 3 square meals in about 4 days. I also discovered the amazing powerade zero. Wow how did I miss the food safety portion of meal prep. I feel like people never discuss this. I think I will freeze all meals from now on, because I've come way too far.

I’ll eat a low number of calories, Ill go on two hour walks, and I’ll track everything and it feels better then eating. Weight drops and I feel better, nicer, worthy of living. I’ll obsess over it and feel proud. \n\nThen something happens, an anxiety breakdown, finals week, everything shatters and I’ll eat.

I was told I have reactive hypoglycaemia that is triggered by hunger. I get it even on days when I thought I was eating properly, which is annoying and discouraging. I've had this since my early twenties when I started having issues with disordered eating. My metabolism is all over the place. I gain weight really easily it seems, or it feels that way but idk what's normal now that I'm 30. Maybe it feels worse because my life isn't as physically active as it was ten years ago when I was in college and walking around campus. I also have other mental health problems like social anxiety and agoraphobia. I've had agoraphobia since my teens, but it went away for a few years during my time in college. I am fixated constantly on the time that I was going to school. I was happy then even though I still had issues, and it was also the same time that I started to have disordered eating issues. I wanted and still want to be thin even though I don't think I'm pretty enough to look good at any weight if that makes sense. I think I have body dysmorphia as well but it's hard to accept that because I am convinced that I truly am ugly or at least not conventionally good looking and it's hard to believe it's just in my head as I have been told and continue to be told randomly by guys and sometimes girls that I'm ugly. I was told a few months ago I looked horrible by some old man walking by, and was told I was ugly by my uncle's fitness trainer who was at a family gathering the year before COVID. These comments on my appearance have messed me up, and they seem like they happen constantly, thus why I'm agoraphobic. \n\nI'm sorry this rant is all over the place.

It got very bad a few weeks ago and my husband has been VERY concerned. He recently found out he’s required to serve a few weeks in jail for an old DUI case and we’ve been thinking about having kids in the next year or two, so I told myself that while he’s there, I’d use this time to better myself and get ready for that goal: work on the house, go sober, and most importantly, work on recovery. It should be the most stressful time in my life and it should be the easiest time to relapse, but, he left the 2nd and I haven’t had an episode since the 30th!!! We haven’t discussed it at all since he’s been in there — we talk about everything and anything all day through phone calls and text but it’s all technically monitored and he knows I’m incredibly ashamed of this habit — and I cannot WAIT to tell him when he gets out how far I’ve made it in my recovery!

No orgasm I\'ve ever been given has felt as good as having a man compliment "my cute little butt" or fondling my hip bones in bed. It\'s fucked up. It\'s *so* fucked up.
