She's always commenting about how I've gained weight, and how I'm fat, and how I need to be skinny to be pretty. But her calling me fat, makes me sad which makes me want to eat. I'm so afraid of food but so drawn to it at the same time. I'll eat, even when I don't want to eat. I'll eat a lot one day, remember my mother's words, and not eat the next. I always feel not good enough, I feel so damn ugly. I've tried purging, but I'm also very afraid of throwing up so I couldn't go through with it. I'm trying to get better, but it's very very difficult for me. Especially since my mother's comments are a daily thing. I don't know what to do anymore.\n1.8K\nREPLY, Comment 3: Abby L\n2 years ago\ni'm crying right now because you're describing almost my everyday life for me and everything that i've been doing recently... except i'm not getting skinnier because i could go all day with only eating one meal, then once everyone is sleeping i'll eat three family size bags of chips. I just wish I could stop eating. I eat when i'm bored. When i'm angry, sad, happy, confused. I just can't stop and I hate myself for it\n828\nREPLY",
