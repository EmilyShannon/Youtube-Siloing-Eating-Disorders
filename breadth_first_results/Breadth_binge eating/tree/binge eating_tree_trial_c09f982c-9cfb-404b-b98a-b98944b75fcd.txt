We are evolutionarily primed to thrive in a food scarce environment with natural foods, but now face an endless supply of processed junk food that has the power to cause addiction.\n\nRecorded and edited courtesy of NorthCoast Productions. Andrew Becker is from the small town of Slinger Wisconsin, and completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in human biology with an emphasis in dietetics from the University of Wisconsin Green Bay. Currently, he is completing his Ph.D. in biochemistry in Dr. Jong-In Park's lab at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The focus of his research is to investigate how certain types of cancers utilize the ERK1/2 signaling pathway to promote their proliferation. Along with his research, Andrew has an immense passion for nutrition. He believes it is important for everyone to understand how the foods they eat affect their health. He has made it a life-long goal to continuously teach the public about nutritional health whenever he gets the opportunity.

You know you are craving for something which is unhealthy, you eat it like there's no tomorrow because you get excited, and then you regret and your mind is full of guilt after looking at that place which you just emptied. You look at yourself, your bloated stomach and face and scold yourself for doing it all over again. And when you talk about this problem about how hard you try not to, or in my case, how I am SCARED of eating food because I'll gain weight, they either judge you for whether you are going through some ED or just for fun, call you overdramatic. \nIdk I just had to say this here because I guess I'm not the only one who goes through this mental battle with my own mind and other people's mind\n493\nREPLY, Comment 2: Mychannel\n2 years ago\nHonestly feels so good to know I\u2019m not alone.. my food addiction made me gain 100lbs..

I have battled and quit drinking and smoking cigarettes cold turkey with a few relapses of course but this addiction has honestly been the hardest to face and hardest to even recognize. Anyway I\u2019m going to battle this addiction and win because I know I\u2019m stronger than my appetite and I\u2019m more motivated to change this pattern than I ever have been since my cigarette addiction has been beat.

        "description": "Binge eating is roughly defined as eating more food than a \u201cnormal\u201d person would in a short period of time. And as I have talked about many many times, eating disorders are just coping skills for other things going on in our life.  \nBased on the way our nervous system is set up it\u2019s soothed by eating. We are born to be soothed and calmed down by being fed. Sucking a swallowing from a bottle soothes our system as babies and helps us calm down. As adults if we have attachment issues (maybe our caregivers weren\u2019t reliable or predictable in how they interacted with us) we could struggle to self soothe. Also if we have BPD it can be hard to soothe our system because we feel everything so intensely. So we can turn to food to help us feel better, which is why emotional eating is so very common. Also with the pandemic and all the stress that it has caused we are all seeking out ways to feel safe, and okay. So we may be binge eating as a way to cope. \nWe can also struggle as the day progresses because we get tired, overwhelmed, and are therefore more vulnerable to the urges to cope unhealthfully. Since we have a lot of judgment in our society around weight, if we overeat we can then fall into a shame/guilt spiral and follow up our binge eating with restricting (but not always). But for many we can feel like we have to \u201cmake up\u201d for the binge. And get caught in that binge restrict cycle\n\nI'm Kati Morton, a licensed therapist making Mental Health videos!",

Since her recovery, she has worked as a memoirist, national essay finalist, and now TEDxUChicago speaker to help others re-conceptualize eating disorders as symptoms of a deeper societal illness.\nElisabeth is majoring in Fundamentals: Issues and Texts and minoring in Human Rights. Her interdisciplinary program of study extends into all aspects of her life. On campus, she advocates human rights advocacy events with UChicago Amnesty International and helped start its first-annual Human Rights Journal. She is also working on creating a new campus human rights report. Elisabeth is the Head Ethics Editor of the University of Chicago Undergraduate Philosophy Review and is Co-Editor-In-Chief of The Midway Review. She teaches moral and political philosophy to middle-schoolers on the South Side of Chicago. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Anastasia is passionate about poetry, literature, and theatre, leading her to be heavily involved with the Drama Society as a Vice President at the LSE. Since the age of 15, she has struggled with an eating disorder known as EDNOS, and through her experience she has realised the predominance of stigma and stereotypes around this particular mental issue. Her issues have led her to take interest in both charity and healthcare, and she hopes to be more involved in both fields in the future.

The \nchronic focus on beauty directs cognitive, financial, and emotional \nresources away from other more important goals. Dr. Engeln considers whether there is hope for treating the epidemic of beauty sickness and what it might be like to live in a world where women feel free to spend less time in front of the mirror and more time changing the world. \n\n\nDr. Engeln is a psychology professor and body image researcher at \nNorthwestern University. She is the author of \"Beauty Sick: How the \nCultural Obsession with Appearance Hurts Girls and Women\" (Harper, \n2017).

        "description": "What image comes to your mind when you hear the term anorexia nervosa? Historically, eating disorders have been viewed in predominantly negative terms as \u201cmental\u201d disorders, most commonly occurring in females 10 to 25 years old. Kreipe\u2019s perspective emanating from the integration of concepts of human ecology, the normal \u201ctasks of adolescence\u201d and brain development yields a more comprehensive approach that facilitates treatment acceptance and eschews negative stereotyping often applied to patients with an eating disorder and their families. Whatever image is in your mind with respect to eating disorders will be challenged by this presentation. As a board-certified pediatrician and adolescent medicine specialist at the University of Rochester, Dr. Richard Kreipe, MD, has applied the biopsychosocial approach developed more than 50 years ago. Rather than dichotomize illness into medical or psychiatric domains, the approach considers all levels of the \u201cperson\u201d \u2014 from molecules to community \u2014 to be dynamically interactive. This approach is guided by an ecological framework, recognizing that young people have a powerful influence on their environment (including parents, siblings, family, peers, school, neighborhood, etc.) and their environment profoundly influences their growth and development with potentially long-lasting effects. In 1985, Kreipe established the interdisciplinary Child and Adolescent Eating Disorder Program in Pediatrics at the University of Rochester. He has served as the medical director of the New York State Department of Health\u2019s Western NY Comprehensive Care Center for Eating Disorders since its inception in 2005, covering a 30-county area. His best teachers have been patients and their families. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",

BED is associated with several medical and psychiatric conditions. There are a variety of associated risk factors that increase the risk of having BED, including certain early childhood experiences.
