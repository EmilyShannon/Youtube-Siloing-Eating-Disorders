Anything I've avoided looking at - my poor spending choices, my bank account and my diet - I haven't been able to change because I was not letting myself fully see the issue. \n\nThe more you avoid something, the more you want to avoid it because avoidance is the behaviour we carry out in response to an anxiety inducing stimulus. No one wants to experience negative emotions! By seeing it clearly you realise that its not some enormous mountain, and your anxiety decreases.  When you remove negative emotions (guilt, shame, and fear) you can see that small, easy, simple changes are all you need.\nRead more\n12\nREPLY, Comment 3: Zelda Wolf\n1 year ago\nI'd like to break the habit of judging myself when I overeat or my weight goes up when I am putting in so much effort to sustain it. It is hard to not become discouraged and to talk negatively to myself. I want to change this habit to be more compassionate to myself because I will mess up or not always get the results I want, but what matters is that I am consistent and putting in the effort and even if I mess up, I can gently and compassionately get back to where I was  when I go astray.\n50\nREPLY",

And every small step \u2013 part of the journey to the highest peek. The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art \u2013Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. \u201cThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance\u201d, says master Yi.  And as for flying \u2013 yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020. \n\n\nArtist:                   Secret Garden\nAlbum:                Earthsongs\nTrack:                   Lotus\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Ren\u00e9e Jones shows you how to get free from the emotional eating that sabotages every diet.\n -\nAfter 40 years on a diet, yo-yoing up and down the scale, Ren\u00e9e Jones had learned every diet \u2013 and every cheat \u2013 before finally stopping the comfort eating and self-sabotage to lose \u201cthose last 30 pounds\u201d AGAIN in 2012 \u2013 but this time she maintained her goal weight.  Who knew that was truly possible?\n \nWith a Master\u2019s degree in Marriage and Family Counseling and a Clinical Residency in Pastoral Care, she has an international counseling and coaching practice utilizing traditional and contemporary models as well as relaxation and horse-assisted methods to help others win at losing extra weight and other baggage they\u2019ve dragged with them for decades.  \n\nHer first book was \"What\u2019s Really Eating You: Overcome the Triggers of Comfort Eating.\" This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

As a person who has completely changed their body, i thought I would drop tips as well.\n First of all, before you start exercising, slowly work yourself into an overall healthy eating pattern over the course a month first. No amount of motivation can hardly beat the chemical imbalance the average american diet imposes on us. Get your body the correct nutrition and hydration first, so then when you begin, your body can recover correctly and you wont become sick. \nSecondly, START SLOW. All physical changes in us, big or small, are adaptations., Your body is not adapted to working out, so you will likely injure yourself or become so sore that for the next two days you so you cant even work out if you push too hard on your initial attempt. Start with a speed walk, and do light resistant weight training. \nRead more\n1.5K\nREPLY",

Our relationships with food have evolved over the past century, leading to this paradox. In this talk, Pete sheds some light on this problem and offers a solution. Pete was morbidly obese for almost 30 years. Doctors diagnosed him with diabetes, depression, fatty liver, and high blood pressure along with neuropathy, partial blindness, and sleep apnea. He lost 115 lbs about seven years ago and kept it off with a reversal of several health issues. He\u2019s spent most of his career working with people with disabilities and is a diabetes prevention coach.He\u2019s a member of the board of directors and Chair of the board for the Upper-valley Center for Domestic Violence and chair of the Madison County Community Council.

We are evolutionarily primed to thrive in a food scarce environment with natural foods, but now face an endless supply of processed junk food that has the power to cause addiction.\n\nRecorded and edited courtesy of NorthCoast Productions. Andrew Becker is from the small town of Slinger Wisconsin, and completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in human biology with an emphasis in dietetics from the University of Wisconsin Green Bay. Currently, he is completing his Ph.D. in biochemistry in Dr. Jong-In Park's lab at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The focus of his research is to investigate how certain types of cancers utilize the ERK1/2 signaling pathway to promote their proliferation. Along with his research, Andrew has an immense passion for nutrition. He believes it is important for everyone to understand how the foods they eat affect their health. He has made it a life-long goal to continuously teach the public about nutritional health whenever he gets the opportunity.

You know you are craving for something which is unhealthy, you eat it like there's no tomorrow because you get excited, and then you regret and your mind is full of guilt after looking at that place which you just emptied. You look at yourself, your bloated stomach and face and scold yourself for doing it all over again. And when you talk about this problem about how hard you try not to, or in my case, how I am SCARED of eating food because I'll gain weight, they either judge you for whether you are going through some ED or just for fun, call you overdramatic. \nIdk I just had to say this here because I guess I'm not the only one who goes through this mental battle with my own mind and other people's mind\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\n493\nREPLY, Comment 2: \u0416\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b\n2 years ago (edited)\nLike any addiction, food addiction is both physical and emotional and it has been my lifelong struggle. However, what helped immensely combat my food addiction was first significantly reducing my sugar consumption. I am more into savory food than sweets but for some time I had been consuming lots of processed sugar and my body was asking for more and more. I had very challenging withdrawal symptoms for the first 2+ weeks but later it became easier. If I did not make a sacred oath, I do not think I would had enough will power to restrain myself. \n\nI did not eliminate sugar completely but have reduced my consumption by 90%. To indulge my sweet tooth, I eat fresh and baked fruits, figs, prunes, and some other dried fruits but in small quantities. I use pure vanilla extract, cinnamon, date paste/sugar, and occasionally honey to sweeten my low sugar desserts or lemonade. I do not use artificial sweeteners. Very rarely I would also eat a regular dessert. That alone was not enough but made my transition to the next phase smoother. \nRead more\n73\nREPLY, Comment 3: Paul Robeson\n2 years ago\nFood addiction is actually a new concept to me. I have battled and quit drinking and smoking cigarettes cold turkey with a few relapses of course but this addiction has honestly been the hardest to face and hardest to even recognize. Anyway I\u2019m going to battle this addiction and win because I know I\u2019m stronger than my appetite and I\u2019m more motivated to change this pattern than I ever have been since my cigarette addiction has been beat.

    "top_3_comment": "Comment 1: Fay A\n1 year ago\nThe best way to discribe binge eating in my opinion, is continue eating even when you are full and not enjoying the food.\n3.4K\nREPLY, Comment 2: Rhyan McDowell\n8 months ago\nSomething I\u2019ve noticed during my binges is that I always need to be watching tv while I\u2019m eating so that I am truly tuned out. In order to be more mindful I\u2019m going to try and eat without screens present! Thanks for the video!\n1K\nREPLY, Comment 3: Enchanted Panda\n1 year ago\nLiterally everyday I'll binge eat when I'm stressed or just because I feel lonely. After I'm done eating I'll feel guilty and then force myself to vomit and then starve myself for the rest of the day and be like \"I'll start a diet tomorrow\" or \"I'll get in a good eating habits tomorrow\" but then the process just repeats and repeats.\n1.7K\nREPLY",
