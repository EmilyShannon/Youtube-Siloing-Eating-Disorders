As a bulimic myself I think there needs to be more representation like this in the media. Eating disorders aren't pretty little stick thin girls who say no to dinner. Not all the time.\n126\nREPLY, Comment 2: Zelly Sidi Zamzami\n1 year ago\nThank you for sharing this. As a male who is struggling with bullemia for years your story hit home. Sometimes i don't know how to handle emotional pain and throwing up is an easy way. I wish i could fully escape the obsession with my weight and my body image. It's hard a journey.\n69\nREPLY, Comment 3: I edited my username !!!\n1 year ago\nThank you  Im struggling with Bulimia right now and this really hit home.\n70\nREPLY",

In August, 2021, the Foundation featured Dr. Laura A. Berner of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.\n\n\nDescription: Every day, our brains bring together information from our bodies and environments to control our eating behavior. In turn, eating, or not eating, influences our brains' self-control circuitry. Extremes in the control of eating behavior, as well as other non-food-related behaviors, characterize individuals with bulimia nervosa. Dr. Berner will discuss how self-control goes awry in bulimia nervosa; describe how these disturbances could promote symptoms like binge eating, purging, and dietary restriction; and review how disruptions in self-control circuitry may help us predict clinical outcome and develop new treatments.\n\nLearn more at ",

And to the losers criticizing her body shape: she's a middle-aged woman who has suffered with obesity most of her life. Get a grip, stop being such losers.\n467\nREPLY, Comment 2: chrokeii\n3 years ago\nI'm glad she's bringing this up, but I was hoping to hear some suggestions about how to overcome food addiction\n345\nREPLY, Comment 3: Rien Jen\n4 years ago\nShe brings up some great points.  Body-shaming is hateful, hurtful and over-simplistic; there are several reasons why we have this problem and one of the biggest being that junk food is cheap, it's addictive and it's everywhere.  You can't go into a dang store without candy for sale near the cashier.  I'm lucky not to be overweight, but I struggle to keep the scale from creeping upwards, because when it goes up even a few pounds, losing that weight is just about the hardest thing to do.\n43\nREPLY",

We are evolutionarily primed to thrive in a food scarce environment with natural foods, but now face an endless supply of processed junk food that has the power to cause addiction.\n\nRecorded and edited courtesy of NorthCoast Productions. Andrew Becker is from the small town of Slinger Wisconsin, and completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in human biology with an emphasis in dietetics from the University of Wisconsin Green Bay. Currently, he is completing his Ph.D. in biochemistry in Dr. Jong-In Park's lab at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The focus of his research is to investigate how certain types of cancers utilize the ERK1/2 signaling pathway to promote their proliferation. Along with his research, Andrew has an immense passion for nutrition. He believes it is important for everyone to understand how the foods they eat affect their health. He has made it a life-long goal to continuously teach the public about nutritional health whenever he gets the opportunity.

You know you are craving for something which is unhealthy, you eat it like there's no tomorrow because you get excited, and then you regret and your mind is full of guilt after looking at that place which you just emptied. You look at yourself, your bloated stomach and face and scold yourself for doing it all over again. And when you talk about this problem about how hard you try not to, or in my case, how I am SCARED of eating food because I'll gain weight, they either judge you for whether you are going through some ED or just for fun, call you overdramatic. \nIdk I just had to say this here because I guess I'm not the only one who goes through this mental battle with my own mind and other people's mind\n493\nREPLY, Comment 2: \u0416\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b\n2 years ago (edited)\nLike any addiction, food addiction is both physical and emotional and it has been my lifelong struggle. However, what helped immensely combat my food addiction was first significantly reducing my sugar consumption. I am more into savory food than sweets but for some time I had been consuming lots of processed sugar and my body was asking for more and more. I had very challenging withdrawal symptoms for the first 2+ weeks but later it became easier. If I did not make a sacred oath, I do not think I would had enough will power to restrain myself. \n\nI did not eliminate sugar completely but have reduced my consumption by 90%. To indulge my sweet tooth, I eat fresh and baked fruits, figs, prunes, and some other dried fruits but in small quantities. I use pure vanilla extract, cinnamon, date paste/sugar, and occasionally honey to sweeten my low sugar desserts or lemonade. I do not use artificial sweeteners. Very rarely I would also eat a regular dessert. That alone was not enough but made my transition to the next phase smoother. \nRead more\n73\nREPLY, Comment 3: Paul Robeson\n2 years ago\nFood addiction is actually a new concept to me. I have battled and quit drinking and smoking cigarettes cold turkey with a few relapses of course but this addiction has honestly been the hardest to face and hardest to even recognize. Anyway I\u2019m going to battle this addiction and win because I know I\u2019m stronger than my appetite and I\u2019m more motivated to change this pattern than I ever have been since my cigarette addiction has been beat. This was a great video and I appreciate what you said and how you said it.\n256\nREPLY",

        "description": "Binge eating is roughly defined as eating more food than a \u201cnormal\u201d person would in a short period of time. And as I have talked about many many times, eating disorders are just coping skills for other things going on in our life.  \nBased on the way our nervous system is set up it\u2019s soothed by eating. We are born to be soothed and calmed down by being fed. Sucking a swallowing from a bottle soothes our system as babies and helps us calm down. As adults if we have attachment issues (maybe our caregivers weren\u2019t reliable or predictable in how they interacted with us) we could struggle to self soothe. Also if we have BPD it can be hard to soothe our system because we feel everything so intensely. So we can turn to food to help us feel better, which is why emotional eating is so very common. Also with the pandemic and all the stress that it has caused we are all seeking out ways to feel safe, and okay. So we may be binge eating as a way to cope. \nWe can also struggle as the day progresses because we get tired, overwhelmed, and are therefore more vulnerable to the urges to cope unhealthfully. Since we have a lot of judgment in our society around weight, if we overeat we can then fall into a shame/guilt spiral and follow up our binge eating with restricting (but not always). But for many we can feel like we have to \u201cmake up\u201d for the binge. And get caught in that binge restrict cycle\n\nI'm Kati Morton, a licensed therapist making Mental Health videos!",
