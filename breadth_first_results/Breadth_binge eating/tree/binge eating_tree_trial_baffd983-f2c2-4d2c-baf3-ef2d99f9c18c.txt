Just to let you know, this talk was originally titled \u2018The Consumption Concept\u2019\u2019 when I presented it in Tokyo 2009, I\u2019m not sure why the video is titled \u2018One meal at a time\u2019. Hopefully this should clear up some of the confusion. Out of all the videos I have created, this one holds a special place in my heart and I am incredibly grateful for all the inspiring comments I have seen. With all the health information and nutritional confusion we are drowning in today, keep in mind one of the most powerful things we can do for our well-being is to share a meal with the people we care about.

Body-shaming is hateful, hurtful and over-simplistic; there are several reasons why we have this problem and one of the biggest being that junk food is cheap, it's addictive and it's everywhere.  You can't go into a dang store without candy for sale near the cashier.  I'm lucky not to be overweight, but I struggle to keep the scale from creeping upwards, because when it goes up even a few pounds, losing that weight is just about the hardest thing to do.\n43\nREPLY",

Anorexia and bulimia and now binge sigh what a life.\n62\nREPLY, Comment 2: Hello Hello\n1 year ago\nI'm always afraid I'll starve again.  I was extremely poor when I was little & didn't have enough to eat. I would even eat non edible things like plastic, cloth, rubber, my hair, skin, garbage, just about anything I could find. One time I ate a whole stick of chapstick cause it \"smelled good\" & I was hungry. I'd even drink my own urine. My body actually accepted non edibles better than real food cause it was so used to it.\nI attacked a school lunch staff cause she caught me eating out of a garbage can. She stopped me & I punched her & almost knocked her out & went back to the garbage can. I was just 6 & punched the hardest I've ever punched.\nRead more\n13\nREPLY, Comment 3: Guru Notebooks\n1 year ago\nThe book \"30 Days to Stop Overeating\" by Harper Daniels takes an interesting mindfulness approach.
