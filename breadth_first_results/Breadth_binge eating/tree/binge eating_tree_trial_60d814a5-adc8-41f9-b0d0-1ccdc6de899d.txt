Great message, great presentation.\n1.5K\nREPLY, Comment 2: daniela dietel-wright\n2 years ago\n\"never make a change in your diet, that you don't want to make permanent.\" great line and so true.\n2.1K\nREPLY, Comment 3: Siccboi _27\n3 years ago\nOne of my all time favorite talks. As a person who has completely changed their body, i thought I would drop tips as well.\n First of all, before you start exercising, slowly work yourself into an overall healthy eating pattern over the course a month first. No amount of motivation can hardly beat the chemical imbalance the average american diet imposes on us. Get your body the correct nutrition and hydration first, so then when you begin, your body can recover correctly and you wont become sick. \nSecondly, START SLOW. All physical changes in us, big or small, are adaptations., Your body is not adapted to working out, so you will likely injure yourself or become so sore that for the next two days you so you cant even work out if you push too hard on your initial attempt. Start with a speed walk, and do light resistant weight training. \nRead more\n1.5K\nREPLY",

You know you are craving for something which is unhealthy, you eat it like there's no tomorrow because you get excited, and then you regret and your mind is full of guilt after looking at that place which you just emptied. You look at yourself, your bloated stomach and face and scold yourself for doing it all over again. And when you talk about this problem about how hard you try not to, or in my case, how I am SCARED of eating food because I'll gain weight, they either judge you for whether you are going through some ED or just for fun, call you overdramatic. \nIdk I just had to say this here because I guess I'm not the only one who goes through this mental battle with my own mind and other people's mind\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\n493\nREPLY, Comment 2: Mychannel\n2 years ago\nHonestly feels so good to know I\u2019m not alone.. my food addiction made me gain 100lbs..

When I started recovering from my ED, the biggest struggle was trying to change the way I think about food and myself, as well as the amount of time I spend thinking about food and my body. It still is, even though I'm recovered on the outside, every single day you have to fight it.\n2.9K\nREPLY, Comment 2: Gg Gg\n1 month ago\nTo everyone suffering from an ed, i just want to say :\n1. Don't be afraid or ashamed to seek help and don't think lesser of yourself for seeking help. Everyone falls sick at some point in their life and people suffering from an illness deserve treatment whether it be a mental disorder or a physical disorder\n2. You are not alone. So many people, including me have become better and I promise, even if it takes time, one day things will get better for you too\n2K\nREPLY, Comment 3: mae!\n1 month ago\nthere are so many myths and misconceptions around all mental disorders but eating disorders specifically, thank you so much for trying to clear them up. there are maybe a couple more things you could have gone over but thankyou TED-ED for spreading awareness when possible :)\n1.5K\nREPLY",

BED is associated with several medical and psychiatric conditions. There are a variety of associated risk factors that increase the risk of having BED, including certain early childhood experiences. In this lesson, we discuss the associated conditions and risk factors in more detail, along with the symptoms of BED, the way BED is diagnosed (using the DSM-5 criteria), and methods of treatment. \n\nREFERENCES:\n\"Binge Eating Disorder\", StatPearls (2020)Check out the best tool to help grow your YouTube channel (it\u2019s helped me!)",

So if I ruin my diet in a day, I get depressed and I feel that as I have ruined my diet now, I should eat my heart out as my day is already ruined. So I order food online even if I\u2019m not hungry cause my subconscious mind thinks that I should enjoy and eat my favourite dish as the day is already ruined.\n307\nREPLY, Comment 2: Daily Dose of Medicine\n1 year ago\nDepression and binge eating are strongly linked. Many binge eaters are either depressed or have been before; others may have trouble with impulse control and managing and expressing their feelings. Low self-esteem, loneliness, and body dissatisfaction may also contribute to binge eating.\n140\nREPLY, Comment 3: Tsunami\n5 months ago\nThis is a serious and complex problem that is still very underestimated in the present.\nIn the future it will be seen just as a severe problem as any drug abuse - because chemically, it is.\n27\nREPLY",
