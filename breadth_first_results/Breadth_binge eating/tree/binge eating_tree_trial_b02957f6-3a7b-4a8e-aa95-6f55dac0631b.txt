In this episode of FUEL, we follow Theresa as she drops half a pound a week, working towards her performance goal weight for the upcoming ballet season with American Contemporary Ballet in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nTheresa has honed her diet down to a science by keeping meticulous records, eating pre-packaged meals, and doing lots and lots of calculations \u2013 for her it\u2019s a simple numbers game of calories in versus calories out. This precise calorie counting gives her the peace of mind to maintain her focus on training and long days of dancing, hiking, stretching, and icing. Whether she\u2019s having a midnight bowl of cereal or a 5 A.M. corndog, Theresa has it all calculated, so when it\u2019s time to take the stage, she knows that her body will be ready.\n\nSubscribe to Munchies here: ",

Catherine reveals a deeply honest account into her road to recovery which will hopefully inspire others. \n\nCatherine is a chemistry student at the University of Warwick, a photography enthusiast and a self-confessed perfectionist. While growing up in Leicestershire, Catherine was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa in early 2012 and battled the illness throughout her \u2018A\u2019 levels and the first year of her degree. This resulted in her taking two gap years to get specialist treatment as an inpatient at an Eating Disorders Unit.\n\nCatherine has just completed her second year at university, and has not relapsed. She is busy enjoying student life and everything it entails, before entering the 'world of work' when she graduates next year.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

No one looked beyond it to see if their was a  cooccurring disorder along with it. I certainly had many signs of CPTSD by that point. No one ever looked past blaming everything on my having bipolar until I went in to therapy 16 years later and realized what had been done to me all those years was abuse and at that time it was still going on. I really got a lot better but after 4 years of therapy the state said I'd been in therapy too long and I surely must be \"fixed\". Last fall I tried a new one but just didn't click with her. All I do is try to do the work on my own. I have got to move from here nearer a city.

        "top_3_comment": "Comment 1: It'sVery Controversial\n2 weeks ago\nI completely fixed my anorexia bulimia problem as a young woman by doing this:  Made a 'contract' with myself that if I wanted to escape the most critical voice in my head telling me I was unworthy, I'd have to commit to a 'rule' that if I ate to the point that I would need to purge, then instead of purging (following the typical pattern) I would instead sit with the discomfort of a full stomach which gives you back full control and stops the trigger response of guilt and replaces it with power.  Then you slowly but surely reprogram your patterns of behaviour.  You ultimately need patience and reinforce your strength to follow your own contract.  It worked.  I've never had a problem since.\n3\nREPLY, Comment 2: Bella Zella\n9 days ago\nThanks for this video so glad I discovered your channel\u2026.. I cannot stop eating and it\u2019s becoming extreme. It has become an addiction and feels like a drug. I get instant relief when I eat and I\u2019m not always even hungry. The stress and pressures of life are building and I find myself comfort eating more and more\u2026..\nREPLY, Comment 3: kyah khalsa\n2 weeks ago (edited)\nMy ED is gone now tho after age 15-35.  I like your presentation.  Great info.   But I watch many of your presentations for my self growth.   I was just offering if anyone wanted to know about a severe disorder and recovery from it in a positive strength based way. I\u2019m not a therapist yet tho.  Just a peer\n\nInteresting updated information for diagnostic criteria. You are the most talented clinician I have never met.  They say, \u201cif you can meet anyone alive or dead, who would it be?\u201d You would be on my top 11 list (11 is for the OCD)\nRead more\n1\nREPLY",
