I hope that I can make more videos over the summer (GCSEs are done!) and I can film more interesting food. \n\nAlso note that I also ate meals in addition to my binges, I just didn't film it because I thought it would be boring.

Your editing is so nice and tbh I forgot the length of the video but watched it all. You seem like a really nice person and your channel is a little safe place. I wish you all the best, I hope you're doing okay and staying safe. You're not alone. Take care \ufe0f\n15\nREPLY, Comment 2: Abby Jensen\n2 months ago\nLove this! It's so hard to find long vlogs so please keep making more long ones.

I also tend to plan out specific days where I'm \"free\" to binge, like for special occasions or wtv.\n14\nREPLY, Comment 2: Elena A\n6 days ago\nHappy belated birthday!!! Watching your videos have always made me feel better, especially today, because my birthday is in literally four days and I'm so nervous but excited about it at the same time. Well, now I kinda feel less alone reading the comments... But anyways, hope things get better for everybody who is struggling with an ED.\n5\nREPLY, Comment 3: Defender of Justice 707\n6 days ago\nidk if i\u2019m late but HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!
