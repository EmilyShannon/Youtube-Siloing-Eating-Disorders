        "top_3_comment": "Comment 1: Teeratorn Saneeyeng\n2 weeks ago\nThe dishes on the $1.41 buffet were actually all side dishes that Thai people normally eat with steamed rice. So if you eat them without rice, I can tell you that they're probably all a little too salty. So the taste of all the dishes there usually goes well with steamed rice. Unlike the $83 buffet, where most of the dishes are prepared without rice, the taste is much more pleasant than the $1.41 buffet. For Thai people, the $1.41 buffet is something for everyday consumption, while the $83 buffet is for special occasions.\n1K\nREPLY, Comment 2: Jon\n3 weeks ago\nYou can tell the difference with Sonny between Egypt and Thailand. He is not scared, he is confident here. I feel like Sonny is setting up a roadmap for a few of us to travel. Sonny, is there a document we can download/buy showcasing the places you been over the past few years?\n1.7K\nREPLY, Comment 3: Del\n3 weeks ago\nSonny never forgets to remind us 4-5 times in every episode that he has a wife now. \n512\nREPLY",

High school seniors, Griffin, Hags and Andrew make a pilgrimage to get to the best party in town where all their dreams will come true... Sure they will have to avoid their crazed principal (Vince Vaughn), violent siblings and the wild animals roaming the streets, but that\u2019s all part of the fun! Their friendship will be tested, love live\u2019s will be rattled and their brains completely scrambled. One thing is for sure, no one\u2019s life is EVER the same after participating in The Binge!\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HULU\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nClick the link to subscribe to our channel for the latest shows & updates:  \nHulu on Twitter: ",
