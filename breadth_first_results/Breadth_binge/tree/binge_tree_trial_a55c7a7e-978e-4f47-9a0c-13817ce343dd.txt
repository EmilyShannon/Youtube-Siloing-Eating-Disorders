But people with ED can't stop thinking about food and our body and how big or small we feel or look so be kind and gentle\n5.5K\nREPLY, Comment 2: cinnamon angel\n2 years ago\nGuys I\u2019m 2 months binge free an believe me, it was hard, but once you make that decision everything will go just fine!! Trust me. I made that decision after weighing myself and calculating my bmi and the best thing that I\u2019ve ever done was to have one cheat day a week an the rest of the week you restrict. That one cheat day will motivate you during the week to keep restricting. I\u2019ve lost 5 kg so far, best decision ever made and fucking finally binge free!!\n2.1K\nREPLY, Comment 3: vicious ana\n2 years ago\ni'm proud of you for being 5 day binge free! you are going to get thru this love! and also we eat the ice cream the same way, lol\n939\nREPLY",

I wanted to add about a half a dozen more flavors to this video - ha! Maybe I'll have to do a follow-up video. ;) But I'd love to hear what your favorite flavor combos are! xo - Lisa\n1.1K\nREPLY, Comment 2: Jinya No\n1 year ago\nAs a college student, this is the way to get good amount of nutrients and also saves a lot of time for cooking! I'm taking health and nutrients class and this overnight oats will significantly improve my meal plan and my health overall. Thanks for the inspiration!!\n1.7K\nREPLY, Comment 3: StevenCattyPaw\n9 months ago\nJust FYI for anyone interested, the basic recipe she recommends (1/2 cup oats, 1/2 cup 2% milk, 1/4 cup plain yogurt, 1 tbsp chia seeds, and 1 tbsp honey) comes to 380 calories. Obviously it'll be more if you add any extras to make the more complex versions.\n\nDidn't see that anywhere on here and thought it should be.\n749\nREPLY",

They really destroy your organs, especially your heart muscle. You can die of heart failure so don\u2019t feel bad about not purging, it\u2019s a good thing <3\n91\nREPLY, Comment 2: rebecca xx\n5 months ago\na good first step to stop overeating is to NOT use any electronics while u eat. just focus on the food, eat alot of protein and not just carbs. I know its easier said than done (i literally binged on homemade loaf of bread yesterday) but it is all about self-discipline. Another good thing is to also just give ur credit card to a family member \ud83d\ude04\n272\nREPLY, Comment 3: Croft\n5 months ago\nA tip to stop overeating is leaving your credit card at home and instead bringing a certain amount of cash out with you everyday and setting a limit on how much you can spend. Helps a lot for me :)\n61\nREPLY",
