It's a mix of equal parts both roasted and raw red bhut jolokias, chocolate bhut jolokias, red habaneros, yellow habameros, trinidad scorpion butches, carolina reapers and cayenne peppers to an equal mass of garlic. Use the vinegar of your choice but I do my own mix with lime juice, apple cider vinegar and sweet rice vinegar. Onions, shallots, green onions, chives, if you wish to pump the garlic flavor. Little ginger and mustard are recommended. Healthy dose of both soy sauce and Worcestershire and season with everything as you wish. Do the exact technique Babish did with the blender and fermentation, strain if you wish but I did it chunky, cook it just like the video. And there you have.

You're the only channel I have notifications for. Keep up the good work Ann, we will always support you!\n14K\nREPLY, Comment 2: Jomar Zarandin\n8 months ago\nAnn should be so much appreciated because she's just not debunking, she also teach what is right and what is the wrong thing \ud83d\udc99\n12K\nREPLY, Comment 3: free2saywhatever\n8 months ago\nI absolutely love how she defends parents here. She lives in the REAL world. Not the fake one where helicopter parents are constantly supervising their children. I love that she explains adults owe the kids in the world to protect them and not prey on their vulnerability. So marvelously said!!! I love her!!!!\n2.2K\nREPLY",

And thanks for your lovely viewers who have popped over to my channel, especially so many who have left encouraging and friendly comments! I would have loved you to be there too to help rescue. I think we did something similar, we shoved skewers in and then the candles so it wasn\u2019t too noticeable in the end, even without the cardboard sign which was a nice little touch! Anyway, it\u2019s been a thrill getting a mention from you! Makes the fail all the more worthwhile!\n1.3K\nREPLY, Comment 2: Gangoo\n5 months ago (edited)\n\u201cPersonally I wouldn\u2019t touch it because it was a gift from her to her boyfriend, she\u2019s put in a lot of effort, she\u2019s even ordered a custom cake topper with his name on it, and I think it\u2019s special!\u201d - Anne, who made it a great week by being kind to others \u2764\ufe0f\n4.5K\nREPLY, Comment 3: tarren\n5 months ago\nWhat I love is that you don't just rescue these, you explain WHY they went wrong and how to avoid it. The runny buttercream has always been my downfall and now I know why!!\n1.3K\nREPLY",

The outcry was so big on YT, twitter, FB & Reddit that YouTube simply had to reverse their decision & the debunking video was put back up.  It's now sitting at no.2 when searching 'fractal woodburning' which hopefully means that people will see it before they attempt this incredibly DANGEROUS craft!  Thanks again to you guys & also to some friendly people inside the system who recognised the AI's error.  Here's hoping it helps someone!\n3.3K\nREPLY, Comment 2: gwammeh\n1 day ago\nThe pear compote feels very similar to stoofperen, which we still eat in winters in the Netherlands today! It would\u2019ve probably been much firmer pears than we\u2019re used to today, making the \u201cboil until soft\u201d a multiple-hour endeavor. Definitely fit for either storing away for winter or a nice party where you\u2019re trying to impress your guests with how much time you could afford to put into this dinner!\n319\nREPLY, Comment 3: Medic Webber\n1 day ago (edited)\nI mean this was fascinating and definitely true to your aesthetic, but NO ONE should underestimate the added fun of your family's commentary when tasting the food. Dave, as always, was great, but today your boys had me rolling!! lol Hysterical comments from both. But the comment: \"It tasted AWFUL! \u201c should be a GIF. <\ud83d\ude00\n270\nREPLY",
