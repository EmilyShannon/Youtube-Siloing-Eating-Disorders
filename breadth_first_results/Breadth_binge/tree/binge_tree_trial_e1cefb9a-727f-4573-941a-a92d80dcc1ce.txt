She taught me how to say her name in her language and even some words, I did the same. Her mother was super nice and always brought me treats and loved picking us up from our basketball practices / games. She was my best friend, still miss her as I switched schools and lost touch but I'm thinking of finding her on social media to reconnect and see how she is doing.\n211\nREPLY",

        "top_3_comment": "Comment 1: Anna\n6 months ago (edited)\nSometimes even a \"normal\" day of eating feels like a binge to me. But I'm 3 days binge free. I've made a list of motivations to stop and it's helped a bit.\n\nUPDATE: so it's been 5 months since I commented this and I only now saw all the likes and supportive comments. Thank you so much! I find it very encouraging. Unfortunately it's gotten worse but with school around the corner and seeing how much of a toll it's had on my life, mental health and personality I will change. Starting today! I've failed a lot but I'm gonna keep going.\n1K\nREPLY, Comment 2: Bee\n7 months ago\nI binged for 4 days and holy shit, I didn\u2019t know I could feel so out of control. People don\u2019t understand that when you\u2019re in a binge mindset the only thing you can think about is food. NOTHING could distract me. I remember trying to convince myself I could have just one digestive biscuit before devouring the whole packet. I felt like I could control myself, but I couldn\u2019t. I threw up because of how physically sick I felt (did not purge) It\u2019s horrific. I tried to distract myself so much but the only thing on my mind was food?? It\u2019s three days later, and as of now I feel a lot better. I want to be ashamed with myself, to look back and go- why are you strong enough now, but not then? But that feeling of being out of control sticks in my mind, and I can\u2019t even truly blame myself. Sorry for the rant!!\n1.2K\nREPLY, Comment 3: Xan\n7 months ago\nMan, when you said 'how can I be so excited for food even though my stomach hurts' I really felt that. Like, I have been curled up in pain because of binging so much and literally all I could think about was what to eat next \ud83d\ude2d\n703\nREPLY",
